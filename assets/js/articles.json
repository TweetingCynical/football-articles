      "Manchester United have identified four players who are off the table for any potential sales in the upcoming summer transfer window as Ruben Amorim plans to overhaul his squad. United have endured a disappointing season under new boss Amorim, who took over following Erik ten Hag's dismissal in October.",
      "Currently, the Red Devils languish 16th in the Premier League with a mere 10 victories in the entire 2024/25 campaign - three of which were secured under Ten Hag. With the Europa League final against Tottenham being the club's last chance for silverware this season, significant changes may be required over the summer if Amorim hopes to restore United's former glory.",
      "The reality is that the 40-year-old strategist has found it challenging to adapt the squad he inherited from Ten Hag's reign to his distinctive style of play, with pundits like Gary Neville suggesting that at least six new faces are needed in the first team ahead of next season. However, the board may need to sell stars before they can bring in new talent, as demonstrated by their modest business in January, which saw them spend just £26million on Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "It's believed that minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe is looking to boost United's transfer budget this summer with the permanent departures of three stars currently out on loan. Marcus Rashford has been showcasing his skills at Aston Villa since January after it became clear he didn't fit into Amorim's plans, while Antony is currently enjoying a stint with Real Betis, and Jadon Sancho is at Chelsea.",
      "There's a notion that United could pocket as much as £100m for the trio; however, offloading the players may prove a bit tricky. Chelsea might opt to pay a £5m penalty instead of purchasing Sancho for the £25m they agreed as an obligation for finishing within the top 14 of the league this season, given his lacklustre performances in west London.",
      "Meanwhile, Villa are yet to agree to the £40m asking price that United have set for Rashford, and although Antony has become one of Betis' standout performers recently, they're under no obligation to buy him at the end of his loan spell. Four players who are considered indispensable for United might also cause Amorim some headaches when it comes to his summer plans.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Bruno Fernandes, Amad, Leny Yoro, and Harry Maguire are seen as essential assets at United for the 2025/26 season, meaning that Amorim might be forced to incorporate them into his future plans and build around them – despite Fernandes turning 30 in September, and Maguire just celebrating his 32nd birthday in March. This represents a significant reversal in terms of the players considered indispensable at United going into last year's summer transfer window.",
      "According to the same source in April 2024, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund were the three players that United needed to retain. However, lacklustre performances throughout 2024/25 have seemingly shifted opinion at Old Trafford.",
      "While Garnacho has contributed six goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, he has recently found himself relegated to the bench in favour of Mason Mount.",
      "Hojlund, on the other hand, has only managed to score four times this term in the Premier League, a far cry from the prolific striker that United currently crave. Meanwhile, Mainoo has also failed to deliver from midfield – both stars are goalless and without an assist in 24 league games this season. Only time will tell how things unfold for United this summer, with pressure expected to increase on Amorim in 2025/26.",
      "The board has been remarkably patient with the mastermind's lack of results this term, but that could soon change if he fails to deliver after having a full transfer window and pre-season to adjust his team. However, the forthcoming transfer window will not be the primary concern for United's top brass on Wednesday night.",
      "The Red Devils are setting their sights on clinching their first Europa League title in eight years as they square off against Ange Postecoglou's Spurs. The two teams have only ever clashed once before in Europe, with Matt Busby's United triumphing over Spurs 4-3 on aggregate across two legs during the last 16 of the 1963/64 Cup Winners' Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games in the 2025/26 season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has joked that he could play on until he’s FIFTY after his ‘biological age’ was revealed. The former Manchester United forward is still going strong at 40.",
      "He has netted 33 goals for Saudi side Al-Nassr this season - that form coming after 64 goals across his first 18 months in the Middle East. Naturally, Ronaldo would usually be putting a little bit of thought into hanging his boots up having reached the twilight of his career.",
      "But it appears that new data might have convinced the Portuguese forward to carry on even longer. Ronaldo has had a long-running partnership with fitness watch manufacturers WHOOP.",
      "And part of the technology has revealed that his ‘biological age’ is over a decade younger than he actually is. Speaking on the WHOOP podcast, he said: \"I can't believe it's so good. 28.9.\"",
      "And after learning that, Ronaldo joked that he could potentially prolong his career well into the 2030s. He added: \"This means I'll play football for another 10 years.\"",
      "Ronaldo has already spoken about potentially stepping away from the pitch. While he confirmed that there wasn’t a specific plan, he did admit that it was something on the horizon.",
      "He said: \"I just want to enjoy. Plan for retirement... if it has to happen, in one or two years... I don't know. I'm turning 40 soon... I really want to enjoy, as long as I feel motivated I keep going.",
      "“The day I don't feel motivated, I will retire. When I decide to leave the national team, I'll do it spontaneously but thoughtfully. There won't be any advance announcements.",
      "“I don't see myself managing a team; that's not in my plans. My future lies in other areas outside of football, although time will tell what happens.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has also given his verdict on Ronaldo’s future. And the ex-Chelsea man suggested he could call it a day when long-term rival Lionel Messi does.",
      "He said: \"We all know as footballers, and I know this really, really well from my playing time, there's a time when you come and there's a time where you need to go. I think his time had come a while ago, and he needs to give somebody else the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't think that he is at the moment better than the other options that Portugal have. Some games you need to press, some games you need to do different things, and I don't think that he can do that anymore. There’s no shame in that. For him to even be playing at 40 is a landmark in itself.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to hang the boots up. I think that time will come when Messi stops. I think when Messi decides to call it a day, so will Ronaldo.\""

The San Mames Stadium, home of Athletic Bilbao and the venue for much-anticipated showpiece, has banned e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products, with strict penalties for those who flout the rules.",
      "United and Spurs are both hoping to turn dismal seasons into memorable ones by not only landing a major piece of silverware, but also booking an unlikely ticket to next season's Champions League. Up to 80,000 supporters are expected to descend on Bilbao, a city with a population of around 350,000.",
      "Those with match tickets will need to be on guard, as spectators caught vaping could face ejection from the stadium, a fine, and even a report to the police. While vaping is legal in Spain, the rules inside San Mamés are far stricter for the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of the game, Dan Marchant, director of Vape Club and a founding member of the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), urged fans to respect the rules. \"If vaping is banned in the venue you're travelling to, it's best not to risk a fine or worse,\" he said.",
      "\"Fans heading to Bilbao for the Europa League final need to be especially careful. Those attempting to enter with prohibited items could face eviction and be reported to the police.\"",
      "Marchant added: \"Vaping within the stadium is prohibited, though there may be a designated smoking area. Check ahead of time, and don't risk using your vape in non-designated areas.\"",
      "The list of banned items at San Mamés is extensive. Alongside vaping products and e-liquids, fans are prohibited from bringing photo and video cameras without permission, helmets, balaclavas, ski masks, drones, oversized flags or banners (larger than 2m), food, drugs, alcohol, weapons, laser pointers, megaphones, fireworks, flares, smoke powder, glass or plastic bottles, backpacks and large bags.",
      "United and Tottenham enter the Europa League final with far more at stake than just silverware. Both clubs have suffered dismal domestic campaigns, sitting 16th and 17th respectively in the Premier League - perilously close to relegation. Ravaged by injuries and plagued by inconsistency, the game represents not just a shot at redemption, but a springboard back into Champions League football.",
      "Ruben Amorim's United reached the final with a 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao, while Tottenham secured their final spot with a 3-1 semi-final win over Bodo/Glimt.",
      "For the Red Devils, a win would mark a third consecutive season with silverware, following their FA Cup triumph in 2024 and League Cup success in 2023. Tottenham, by contrast, are chasing an end to a 17-year trophy drought - their last coming in the 2008 League Cup.",
      "While Amorim appears secure in his role, having only taken charge mid-season, Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou's future remains uncertain, with reports suggesting that even a Europa League title may not be enough to save his job."

In this case you get a place in the Champions League, a lot of revenue for the club, it gets more players wanting to come to the club.

Gyokeres is being chased by several top European clubs after putting together a staggering campaign for Sporting, but nothing has been settled yet.",
      "The 26-year-old centre-forward has racked up 53 goals and 13 assists in 51 games across all competitions and could end the campaign with two trophies. Sporting wrapped up the league and now face rivals Benfica in the Portuguese Cup final on Sunday.",
      "Once that game is out of the way, it’s expected to be open season for transfer talks, with Sporting happy to sell for £60million. While Manchester United are considered contenders, Portuguese newspaper O Jogo have claimed Gyokeres is 'on his way to Arsenal'.",
      "It is clear that Gyokeres’ team-mates don’t know if that is true, given the insight of midfielder Pedro Goncalves. “I asked him and we all asked him. He says he’s not a fortune teller. We still have the Portuguese Cup against Benfica to play,” he told Canal 11.",
      "“I have a very good relationship with him, but I don’t talk about it with him. What I know is because of Fabrizio Romano… I’m sticking with him. I don’t know if he’s going to leave.”",
      "They have also kept an eye on RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, but Gyokeres’ weight of goals has made him an attractive prospect. Speaking earlier this year, the Swede admitted he hopes to play for \"one of the best teams in Europe\" soon and Arsenal’s run to the Champions League semi-finals will help.",
      "Goncalves knows that his team-mate is ready for a big-money transfer. “I feel like he’s evolved a lot since he arrived,” he added. “There are training sessions where it seems like he’s holding back.”",
      "United are also interested in Gyokeres, who flourished under Ruben Amorim’s management in Lisbon, but also have other targets. They are in talks to sign Wolves forward Matheus Cunha for £62.5m, while Ipswich’s Liam Delap is also a target for £30m.",
      "Sporting are eager to do business and have agreed to sell Gyokeres for below his release clause as a thank you for his outstanding service. He will reportedly be available for £60m – substantially less than his reported £83.6m release clause."

That is in contrast to his rapport with Ten Hag, who was said to be too robotic for Ratcliffe’s liking.",

Qualifying for the Champions League will increase the club’s budget significantly and attract bigger name players compared to if they are not in European competition at all next season.",
      "But Ferdinand does feel that a handful of players, led by club captain Bruno Fernandes, have shown they are able to succeed in Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "“I think he's got a lot of players,” Ferdinand said. “Bruno, (Alejandro) Garnacho, Amad, (Noussair) Mazraoui has done a decent job when he's come in, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire, (Matthijs) De Ligt, Casemiro, again, has adapted.”",
      "Ferdinand thinks it would be ludicrous for United to change head coach again if Amorim is unable to win tonight’s final against Spurs because he is yet to have a transfer window to shape his squad.",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon boss is starting to receive criticism because of their dismal Premier League campaign, which has seen 18 defeats with a game to go.",
      "\"They've got to recruit not the best players, not the most talented players, the players that fit Amorim's style of playing, which is a physical style of player, dynamic, aggressive, powerful runner who can understand hus tactics.",
      "\"Once he gets a few of those players on board I genuinely think you'll see a different output from this team.\""

      "Louis Saha has branded Manchester United's midfield “shocking” and said it could be their downfall against Tottenham in tonight's Europa League final. Former United striker Saha – who also had a short spell at Spurs – said Ruben Amorim cannot afford to allow his midfield to be out-muscled, like they have been against Ange Postecoglou's side already this season.",
      "United have lost all three meetings with Spurs this season and Saha said Casemiro is the only hope the Red Devils have of controlling the midfield and ultimately emerging victorious.",
      "“In terms of what the score might be, I could see United winning 2-1 or losing 3-0, to be honest!” said Saha. “It's going to be a scruffy one for United, because Tottenham have a lot of things that United don't like. They're strong defensively and their transition is way better, as is their midfield.",
      "“But having someone like Casemiro in midfield - on his day - with all of his experience, might just balance things out a little. United need a strong midfield to turn up on Wednesday and that hasn't been the case against Tottenham in recent meetings.",
      ".",
      "“We've been out-powered by their midfield, to the point where I'd say it's been shocking at times. It's a tough final to predict because we're talking about two teams who know each other well. We've seen in the last few meetings between the two sides that Tottenham have been gaining dominance over United, so they should be favourites.",
      "“But in terms of history, how to manage a final, all of those kind of things, I'd say both clubs are in different positions and United are better equipped in this position. That's giving me confidence going into Wednesday's game. It's going to be interesting to see how the first 20 minutes pan out.”",
      "Saha, speaking exclusively to Ladbrokes, also claimed it makes a mockery of the tournament that one of United or Spurs, 16th and 17th in the Premier League, will be playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "“I don't really understand how either of these two teams can be playing Champions League football, because neither deserve to be, based on what we've seen from them this season,” said Saha. “But these are the rules, so there's not a lot you can do. It's not fair, when you compare it with some of the clubs in the league who will miss out on the Champions League.",
      "“That's only one side of it, though. United, if they win on Wednesday, might turn around and say 'we've still managed to reach the Champions League, despite all of our struggles this season'. It's not something I totally agree with, but it's a great opportunity for both clubs.”",
      "Reflecting on Tottenham's dismal season, which has seen them lose 21 times in the league, Saha said: “Tottenham are now sitting near the bottom of the table because of the mismanagement and an underestimating of needs.",
      "“It's not always about money and spending the most. Sometimes it's about the right people and the right players. That's not an easy job. The sporting director needs to anticipate these kinds of things, and that's an art in itself.”"

      "Manchester United fans have revealed the various lengths they've gone to in order to be in Bilbao for the Europa League final. United will face Tottenham on Wednesday night at the San Mames Stadium.",
      "With Bilbao relatively isolated in the Basque Country, hotel and flight prices have skyrocketed ever since United and Spurs booked their places in the final. That has forced fans to either fork out massive prices for hotels or get creative.",
      "Some have plumped for hostels, with one fan tweeting: \"€450 to stay in a 10 bed prison cell for 2 nights. Bilbao is well and truly on.\" Others have bitten the bullet and paid out for hotels, with one saying: \"Made it to my hotel in Bilbao. €950 for two nights. Asked how much it would have been without the football. €150 she said, apologetically.\"",
      "One three-star hotel in Bilbao is selling rooms for £4000 per night, a huge increase on normal days. Given those massive prices, some supporters have even taken to sleeping on park benches in Bilbao.",
      "One man shared a photo of himself lying on a bench in the Spanish city, with the caption: \"There’ll be thousands of reds, without any beds. Park bench for the night in Bilbao it is.\"",
      "\"Just been looking, the cheapest I could find was a bed in an eight-room dormitory that was £300. Alternative is a nice boutique hotel, double room, £3600. So it's extraordinary times.",
      "\"It's distorting the travel market hugely. But hopefully they're going to have a great time whether they're in the stand or heading to the fanzone by the river.\"",
      "Many United and Spurs fans travelled to Bilbao earlier this week. An ugly brawl erupted between the two sets of supporters in San Sebastian, squaring up to each other before hurling missiles including glasses and wheelie bins in the Old Town.",
      "The Basque regional police force have confirmed that no arrests were made despite the fighting. Things have been calmer during the day of the final, with the police also confirming no-one was seriously injured in Tuesday's clashes.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"In relation to the incidents arising out of the celebration of the Europa League final we have no information on any serious occurrences. No-one has been seriously injured and there have been no arrests so far.",

      "The 21-year-old forward has 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances for Lyon this season and caught the eye with his performances against Manchester United. Cherki netted in both legs of Lyon’s Europa League quarter-final defeat against Ruben Amorim’s side – and they are one of several clubs interested in signing him.",
      "He is understood to have a €22.5million (£19m) release clause in his Lyon contract, which makes him a bargain. That has attracted United, Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City, as well as Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, according to reports in France.",
      "Speaking after their 2-0 win over Angers in their final league game of the season, Cherki strongly hinted that he is about to leave. He said: \"Thanks to OL, the coach, the staff, the president, my teammates and all people at the club.\"",
      "While his destination remains unclear, his talent is without question. Cherki has starred for France Under-21s, scoring 13 goals in 23 games, and is expected to be called up to the senior Les Bleus squad this summer.",
      "He has already earned rave reviews, with Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas saying: \"Cherki is comparable to Messi in terms of technical quality.\"",
      "Cherki himself actually prefers Cristiano Ronaldo, though. \"I had lots of idols but the one that I think is the best and the example to follow is Cristiano Ronaldo,” he told Telefoot. \"Regarding his work and his longevity, that is the example that you have to follow.\"",

      "Manchester United have been forced to change their traditional kit before the Europa League final. The Red Devils take on Premier League rivals Spurs in Bilbao on Wednesday evening.",
      "The match gives Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou the chance to claim silverware at the end of difficult seasons, while the victor will also claim a spot in next season’s Champions League. Each side have already arrived in Spain ahead of Wednesday evening’s game.",
      "But United will have a slightly unfamiliar look when they take to the pitch at San Mames. It has been announced that Amorim’s side will wear black shorts - as opposed to their traditional white - alongside their famous red shirts and black socks.",
      "That is down to Spurs’ 64-year long European tradition. The North London side have worn all white in Europe since 1961, a tradition adopted by former boss Bill Nicholson.",
      "And with Spurs being dubbed as the ‘home’ team for the game, their kit choice takes precedence over United’s. The reason behind Spurs’ all-white kit tradition began over six decades ago, with Nicholson attempting to increase visibility for his players in stadiums not having the best lighting facilities.",
      "It began in an away game to Polish side Gornik. “We just turned up in the dressing room for the game and there was the all-white kit,” former Spurs star Cliff Jones said. “No-one said anything; nothing was said to us. We just focused on the game coming up.”",
      "Ricky George, a young apprentice at the time, added: “The all-white kit was for visibility. It was Bill Nick’s way of looking for those marginal gains. Those nights at White Hart Lane, under the lights, were just very special.”",
      "“We loved playing in all-white,” Jones said. “I honestly cannot say for certain it made any difference in making us see each other better under the floodlights, but we did love playing in it. European nights we felt fresher, the air was different.”",
      "Who will win the Europa League? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "The Europa League final is not the first time that United have opted for a slight kit change during the season. They also wore black shorts during their away trip to Real Sociedad back in March - a game that ended 1-1 after goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mikel Oyarzabal.",
      "They however returned to their more traditional white shorts during the home leg at Old Trafford - a match the Red Devils won 4-1 thanks to a hat-trick from Bruno Fernandes. Regardless of the kit they wear, United will be desperate to win the final and with it, seal their return to the Champions League."

      "A statement from his former club Warrington Town at the time read: \"Scorer of the most spectacular goals, Vini was a well respected, much-loved member of the club, and his ability earned him a place training with the first team despite his young age.",

      "An enquiry has now looked into the circumstances of his death. Bolton Coroner's Court heard that he had quit football just months before his death, with his sister, Mayara De Souza, noticing a distinct change in her sibling.",
      "It was told that the 19-year-old had previously apologised to family and friends for letting them down. Vini was ‘disappointed’ when he was dropped by United at the age of 14 - albeit he continued playing football for five years.",
      "He is said to have never explained why he gave up and stopped training with Warrington Town. It was also said that he had seen his self-esteem drop after his steroid cream for acne run out.",

      "Miss De Souza attempted to get her brother help as she booked a session for him with a psychotherapist which he attended in January, but he turned down any further sessions. When she told Vini he may have been depressed, he ‘laughed in her face’, she told the inquest.",
      "Vini had also stopped going out with friends after admitting to his mum that he had taken drugs at a nightclub on one occasion. A toxicologist's report found no trace of drugs or alcohol in Vini's system when he died.",
      "Vini was eventually found dead on February 20, with police concluding that he had died as a result of 'self-inflicted means by hanging'.",
      "Assistant coroner Stephen Teesdale was satisfied with that cause. Addressing his family, he said: \"There's nothing more you could have done. You did everything. You spotted the problem - depression. You made a plan, you sought professional assistance from a psychotherapist.",
      "\"You had a plan to take him to Brazil. There's nothing more you could have done. He had an entirely supportive family. It was to do with how he saw the world.\"",

      "Although Keane is an Old Trafford legend, he did grow up as a Tottenham fan and the Irishman has delivered his prediction on how the final will play out. Despite admitting there is \"not much\" to separate the two teams, Keane is backing United to lift the trophy.",
      "\"There's not much between them [in the league] but come the crunch, come the final, United's history in finals, them winning cups the last few years, you'd like to think they would have a bit more knowledge around the game than Spurs. That might edge it for them, and I think Bruno can produce that bit of magic.\"",
      "And Fernandes hopes that winning the tournament can be a springboard for United, with the club enduring their worst ever Premier League campaign. \"Every game you have a chance to win a trophy is very big but part of that is every game at this club is massive,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"As Harry [Maguire] has just said, this club is so big, from one week you can be the hero and, the next one, you're the villain. As players, you just think about what we have ahead of us and what we have ahead of us is the chance to get our hands on the trophy.",

A place in next season's Champions League is also at stake and tens of thousands of fans representing both clubs have made the trip to Spain for the big match.",

      "Witnesses claim tempers flared after two rival sets of supporters started hurling insults at each other. Drama then ensued with fans then throwing punches and objects at each other, including a wheelie bin and drinks. One even turned over a table to try and use as a weapon before order was restored by the authorities.",
      "The report adds that no arrests were made, although officers remained in the area. An ambulance was also said to be present with 'several people' treated at the scene, though nobody was taken to hospital.",
      "Tens of thousands of Brits have travelled to Spain to support them teams in the face of astronomical flight fares and a dearth of available accommodation in the Basque region.",
      "The vast majority have been well behaved with no real disturbances prior to the incident in San Sebastian. It's estimated that thousands of fans have travelled without tickets for both team's penultimate match of the season.",

      "United are potentially just 90 minutes away from winning a major European trophy which will see a difficult season end on a really positive note.",
      "It would represent Ruben Amorim's first piece of silverware as United boss and victory also comes with the added boost of qualifying for next season's Champions League.",

      "Read on here >>>",
      "The big unknown here is the fitness of the three players who have returned to training this week. Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won't be fit to start.",
      "Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.",
      "Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn't risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.",
      "Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.",
      "Tyrone Marshall's Manchester United XI:",
      "There wasn't good news on Matthijs de Ligt. The defeneder has travelled to Bilbao with his teammates but will play no part in tonight's game, meaning the Dutchman and Lisandro Martinez are the only two United players to miss out through injury.",
      "While United will be missing just two players tonight, Spurs have bigger problems.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski picked up a knee injury against Crystal Palace recently and will miss the final having undergone surgery, with James Maddison also set to miss out. The latter has travelled with the squad, sparking talk that he could make a return from injury having been ruled out for the season. However, Ange Postecoglou confirmed Spurs' injury situation hasn't changed and so Maddison remains out of action.",

      "The biggest game of United's season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that's evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.",
      "I'd start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham's threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.",
      "Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.",

      "He told Betfair:",
      "This match is pretty impossible to predict when you look at how bad both teams have been. Spurs have done really well against Man United this season, so due to their record against them I'd say Spurs may be slight favourites.",
      "There are more negatives than positives for both teams when you look at them. I really haven't got a clue what to expect or what teams will turn up. It's a bit of a flip of a coin and it'll be a disaster for whoever doesn't win.",
      "Given what’s at stake for both clubs, it could have an impact on the game. There's so much relying on both teams, managers and both clubs' short-term futures.",
      "There's no exaggeration that both teams need an injection of five or six players to try and compete again and that's why the stakes of this game are enormous.",
      "Just because of their record over the last five or six games against them, and particularly this season, I'll go for a Spurs win. It wouldn't surprise me if the game goes all the way to penalties, but I'll go for Spurs to win in normal time.",
      "United have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro's availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final. Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn't. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade. You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.",

      "According to witness accounts and videos shared by residents, the incidents began with shouts and insults between groups of fans. The situation quickly escalated when one of the individuals punched another, causing the other to fall to the ground. Several fans subsequently began throwing objects taken from terrace tables, overturning one and using it as a weapon against another group. Drinking glasses and trash cans were also thrown, creating chaos and danger for passersby and local businesses.",

      "“Their interviews will be along the lines of them saying that they’re so happy and delighted for the fans, but it’s been a difficult season.",
      "“That will be the tone of it. I don’t think there should be a parade through the city for them winning the Europa League.”",

      "United have taken a 26-man squad to Bilbao so Ruben Amorim has some decisions to make this evening.",
      "Here's how we think United will line up.",
      "If it was strategic of Manchester United to allow Tottenham Hotspur to hold their pre-match duties first, it had the desired effect.",
      "Ange Postecoglou rounded on a reporter who suggested he could be remembered as a \"clown\". He dismissed concerns over his future, urging another reporter not to lose any sleep over it. He also reminded his audience he had lifted a trophy and exited stage left at his previous clubs.",
      "Sub-editors could design their back-page splashes hours before deadline. United's timekeeping for press conferences on the continent can be tardy but even if they were late Ruben Amorim was never going to be as quotable as his opposite number.",
      "Postecoglou entered the endgame some time ago. Sources have said he has known for months that he will not be managing Tottenham next season.",
      "Then there is Amorim, seemingly safe whatever the outcome in San Mames. Amorim is partial to a zinger but he was so relaxed that he joked Bruno Fernandes, sitting to his right, was after his job.",

      "It's approaching 4pm in Bilbao on Tuesday. The sun is shining, and the noise is growing. But the noise has a distinctively cockney twang. In pockets on different streets approaching San Mames, Tottenham fans are cranking up the volume.",
      "As Spurs fans spill out onto the streets from one small bar near the ground, they start to wonder out loud where the United fans are. \"Where the f**k are Man United?\" is their Bilbao reworking of a song they often sing.",
      "A day before the Europa League final, it did feel like there were more Tottenham fans in the streets and bars of Bilbao, with a suggestion last week that they were expected to outnumber United fans on the money.",
      "But then it's also the case that the two sets of fans do things differently. While Spurs fans were gathering in numbers, smaller groups of Mancunians were seated around tables in different bars across this wonderful city.",
      "There were dads and lads in the main fanzone, trying to kick footballs into boats on the Nervion River and queuing to have their photo taken with the Europa League trophy. There were groups of five or six, bucket hats on, still singing 'For United are going to Bilbao' while knocking back pints in temperatures that will feel familiar after the spring that Manchester has enjoyed.",
      "There was no mass gathering, though - at least not yet. There might have been more substantial sing-alongs on Tuesday night, and the atmosphere will be cranked up a notch on the day of the final.",
      "There is room for 20,000 fans at United's fanzone in Etxebarria Parkea, with a musical line-up that could sell out Heaton Park, but for many of United's regular European away-dayers, such substantial shows of force and numbers are to be avoided. It's also true that Etxebarria Parkea is at the top of a hill in Bilbao, and as beautiful as the views are, the walk to get there isn't all that much fun.",
      "A group of United fans were scouting it out on Tuesday, climbing the steps to see the ring of steel around it. The big screen is up, and the bars and toilets are ready to go. \"It's f**king miles away,\" didn't suggest they would be going back on game day.",
      "The journey to Bilbao - and the wider Basque Country - has also been challenging. John and John, father and son United fans, were reunited in the city on Tuesday. Dad flew in from Manchester via Amsterdam, but his son was here via Hong Kong.",
      "\"I moved to Hong Kong for work, I don't get back for games often, but I had to be at this one,\" said the younger John.",
      "\"It took 20 hours to get from Hong Kong to Bilbao, but it's nice to be in the sun now. It's a really nice city, it's very friendly and seems like a nice place.",
      "\"I'm not that confident, I think it's going to be dull, 1-0 to United with a Fernandes penalty.\"",
      "They weren't the only father and son. Jonathan Law, from Worsley, stopped for a chat with his son Leo, and they will be hoping Leo's teachers aren't MEN readers after he admitted his son was skipping school to get a different kind of education this week.",
      "\"We just had to be here. We paid too much for the tickets, too much for the hotel, too much for the flights, but we're glad we're here. It's better than being at school,\" said Jonathan, with Leo nodding at that last comment.",
      "\"I'm confident, the closer it gets, the more confident I'm getting. It's United, isn't it? We can turn it on in certain games.\"",
      "Another Mancunian, Paul, was walking around the city with his son Jake. Although tempted, he decided against a chat as his son was also swapping school for watching United in a European final.",
      "One supporter who didn't pay too much for this journey was Nate, who was in Bilbao from Torbay in Devon. A stroke of good fortune had brought him to the city.",
      "\"I've been in Spain in my motor home for a month, I'm sailing back from Santander to Plymouth on Thursday. I booked the crossing six months ago, not realising United were going to get to the final,\" he said.",
      "\"When we booked it, I never booked it with this in mind, but as they progressed through the rounds, I realised there was a possibility they were going to get to the final. Bilbao in the semi-final was the big one to get over.\"",
      "He is also one of the many United fans who have made the journey without a ticket, but he did the same in Stockholm for the Europa League final against Ajax in 2017 and plans to try the same approach to getting inside San Mames.",
      "\"I don't have a ticket, but everyone says leave it as long as possible, that's what I did in Stockholm,\" he said. \"I left it until five minutes before kick-off and got two tickets for face value, so the longer you hold the nerve, the better you have of getting good value.\"",
      "Although United fans seemed outnumbered on Tuesday, that might not be the case on matchday. Thousands are staying around the Basque Country after refusing to pay the price of accommodation in Bilbao.",
      "The MEN are holed up in San Sebastian, and a few groups of United fans were in the city on Monday night. More arrived on Tuesday, and others are on the other side of Bilbao in Santander.",
      "Andrew Houten and his dad flew from Manchester to Nantes in the west of France on Monday. They then took the train further south to Bordeaux before getting a coach to Bilbao. They are staying in Zaramillo, a small village about 20 minutes outside of Bilbao.",
      "Richard, a United fan from Blackpool, found another way to beat the exorbitant flight prices. Just come earlier.",
      "\"I went via Berlin,\" he said. “The flights were difficult, and I'm going back via Mallorca. I saw quite a few United fans on the route out, and it's a Sunday night to Friday trip. I had to square it with the wife, although I made sure I booked it first!",
      "\"The atmosphere has been fairly tame so far, but we found a couple of bars on Monday that were quite lively. There was a good mix of United and Spurs. It's been very friendly so far.",
      "\"I can't say I'm feeling confident, I think it's going to finish about 1 in the morning.\"",
      "For those fans staying outside of Bilbao, the challenge of getting back to their accommodation will begin then. For now, they have the excitement of a matchday to come. And today, the Spurs fans might see a little more red in Bilbao."

      "The subject of their fun sat on the other side of the United head coach. Harry Maguire has, in many ways, been the hero of this Europa League campaign. An injury-time equaliser at Porto and then that unforgettable winner in extra-time against Lyon that sent Old Trafford into a frenzy.",
      "There was also the twisting, turning dribble down the wing in this very stadium three weeks ago. He went one way, then the other, and then he whipped in a cross that ended with Casemiro setting United on their way to a Europa League semi-final cruise against Athletic Club.",
      "Manuel Ugarte flicked that cross on to Casemiro, so Maguire didn't actually get the assist, which is perhaps Exhibit A as to why these starts can be so worthless. Everyone knows the 32-year-old was the real hero of that goal.",

      "It's easy to forget now, but the build-up to the Europa League final in Gdansk in 2021 focused on Maguire's fitness. He was nowhere near being fit, but United took him along and had him pictured in training to keep up the suspense.",
      "The next time United reached a cup final, he was a figure of fun, routinely jeered on pre-season tours and captain in name only. He was on the bench for the Carabao Cup final success in 2023 and came on for the final two minutes, sharing the trophy lift with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Maguire stopped to speak to reporters in the mixed zone at Wembley that day and insisted he was happy to be part of a trophy-winning United side after six years without silverware, but he must have been hurting at seeing his role reduced.",
      "\"I don’t have any mixed emotions, it’s been so long since the club won a trophy, it’s a really good day for the club and the fans,\" he said that day.",
      "\"I am club captain and my main job is to move this club forward and to bring success back to the club and today has been part of it. Obviously, listen, I am a footballer who wants to play games and I want to lead the boys out of the tunnel at the start of the game but also like I said I understand this is part and parcel of football when you play at the top level and you have got huge competition for places.",
      "\"It’s a real good day for the club and for me and a proud day for my family who were in the stands and saw me lift my first trophy for Manchester United.\"",
      "United were in an FA Cup final later this season, and Maguire didn't get off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City. A year later, he was injured for the Wembley win against Manchester City.",
      "So in four cup finals since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019, Maguire has missed two through injury and played a combined two minutes in the other. It sums up his fortunes at United.",
      "But over the last couple of years, the narrative has turned again. For all of those cup final disappointments, the winner against Lyon felt like his moment at United.",
      "“I've had some amazing moments at this club, been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest! It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed.\"",
      "Now, finally, Maguire will get to play in a cup final. He's no longer captain, but he's more of a leader now than when he wore the armband. He's had to wait for this moment, but few players deserve this final more than Maguire."

      "If it was strategic of Manchester United to allow Tottenham Hotspur to hold their pre-match duties first, it had the desired effect.",
      "Ange Postecoglou rounded on a reporter who suggested he could be remembered as a \"clown\". He dismissed concerns over his future, urging another reporter not to lose any sleep over it. He also reminded his audience he had lifted a trophy and exited stage left at his previous clubs.",
      "Sub-editors could design their back-page splashes hours before deadline. United's timekeeping for press conferences on the continent can be tardy but even if they were late Ruben Amorim was never going to be as quotable as his opposite number.",
      "Postecoglou entered the endgame some time ago. Sources have said he has known for months that he will not be managing Tottenham next season.",
      "Then there is Amorim, seemingly safe whatever the outcome in San Mames. Amorim is partial to a zinger but he was so relaxed that he joked Bruno Fernandes, sitting to his right, was after his job.",
      "That job is not in jeopardy. Amorim will be judged sooner than the two years he suggested it was fair to assess him at United. He has to oversee demonstrable improvement ahead of the trio of international breaks in September, October and November next season.",
      "He sounded borderline bewildered he was not as certain to be summoned to the guillotine as Postecoglou is. \"It's strange because you have some coaches that are here that lose some games and they are sacked. It's hard to explain,\" he shrugged.",
      "Not really. Ineos sought out every Tom, Dick and Harry to replace Erik ten Hag, watched United punch above their weight in the FA Cup final, had a leadership vacuum, lost their nerve and pandered to fickle fans.",
      "Once decision-makers were in the building and this season was becoming an extension of last season, they left emotion at the door. Ten Hag was never their man but Amorim is.",
      "In The Thick of It, Malcolm Tucker spells it out for the gaffe-prone minister Nicola Murray: \"The PM is not going to sack you after a week. Sacked after 12 months - looks live you've f****d up. Sacked after a week - looks like he's f****d up.\" The timeframes are different for the United brains trust and Amorim but the same logic applies.",
      "To dismiss Amorim after six months would be their f**k-up. Amorim has inherited an inadequate squad teeming with expensive errors and United have to purge it in the summer.",
      "He has reiterated that winning the Europa League this season cannot mask United's problems. Quite so. United have to be measured by their Premier League form: 16th, 18 defeats, -12 goal difference, no back-to-back wins. That would be relegation form in other seasons. Under Amorim, it is six wins out of 26 and 18 defeats. That is sackable form.",
      "But context is key. United assembled a Dutch-centric squad over three summers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's cabal inexplicably backed Ten Hag to the hilt despite all the evidence pointing to the contrary.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident but we already know the problems,\" Amorim explained. \"There's a lot of things that we need to change in our club. The way we do everything during the week in Carrington, the recruitment, the academy, I think we need to improve.",
      "\"So it's hard to point one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.\"",
      "This was a prosaic pre-match gathering, even with the majority of questions asked by the dedicated correspondents accustomed to Amorim's stock answers. He has been on repeat for several months as United's domestic form has remained consistently dire and, without any jeopardy surrounding Amorim's role, apathy has developed.",
      "He could afford to be chipper with Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt the only senior players absent from the travelling squad. De Ligt strolled around the San Mames pitch with teammates at 7pm but Amorim confirmed he is out.",
      "Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee will only be able to get \"limited\" playing time. Zirkzee last played 38 days ago, Dalot has been sidelined for a month but Yoro's foot injury was only ten days ago.",
      "Zirkzee's presence was a major surprise. Rasmus Hojlund has been hapless this calendar year, scoring three goals in 33 games. Amorim convinced Zirkzee, ruled out for the season with a hamstring injury five weeks ago, to make himself available as the only alternative striker, with Chido Obi ineligible and also not ready.",
      "\"They recovered quite well,\" Amorim remarked. \"They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to be part of the team and that is a very, very good sign.",
      "\"And it's very good for us. Of course they are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "The notion that Zirkzee could start ahead of Hojlund is unrealistic. United salvaged last season in the FA Cup final by dropping Hojlund in favour of a strikerless starting XI but that was in a 4-2-3-1, not the 3-4-2-1 Amorim swears by.",
      "\"Our system is the normal system that can change the characteristics,\" Amorim added. \"It's not about playing as a striker or without a striker. It's a system like any other that you can change the characteristics.",
      "\"But it doesn't matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, different competition, different context, so everything was different. I just focused on the way we play, the way Tottenham play, what we can do to be better than the last two games.",
      "\"So that was my focus and not the last time that we won a cup.\"",
      "There was more levity when Maguire's dribble-and-cross against Athletic Bilbao was raised. Amorim and Fernandes were both giggling. \"The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" Maguire quipped. He stressed that he hoped he would not have to go up front on Wednesday evening.",
      "A European final is no occasion to be clowning around."

It has been another disappointing season for United, largely due to their struggles in front of goal, with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failing to provide consistent attacking threats.",

      "Quizzed about whether he had asked him to stay, Goncalves revealed to Portuguese channel Canal 11 what the forward has said about his future. He said: \"I did and and so did the whole squad. He says he’s not a fortune teller.",

      "Amad and six other Manchester United players have taken to social media ahead of tonight's Europa League final against Tottenham in Bilbao (8pm).",
      "Despite their disappointing domestic campaign, United can still clinch Champions League football in next season's edition if they lift European silverware. Tottenham have also endured a lacklustre season, with Ange Postecoglou's side sitting 17th place in the table, just one point below United.",
      "Qualifying for the Champions League would be a huge boost for Ruben Amorim and key figures behind the scenes in their pursuit for new signings this summer. Ahead of the big showdown, Amad was joined by Casemiro, Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Andre Onana and Alejandro Garnacho in posting a pre-match graphic preview.",
      "Historically, this suggests they will likely all be involved in some capacity. Amad will be eager to get the nod after coming off the subs bench in both legs of the semi-final against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Casemiro and Yoro both started in the two legs against Bilbao, while Dalot has been an ever-present figure in the squad, at least before his recent injury.",
      "Speaking ahead of the clash, head coach Amorim said: \"The feeling we take, if we win this game, is going to be so important for what we want to build in the club, and they [the fans] deserve it. If there are some fans that deserve a title this season, it's Manchester United fans.",
      "\"So, we'll hope to win something for them.\"",
      "He added: \"That is a clear feeling [the club owe their fans silverware]. It's not just me, it's everybody, all the players, all the staff. We owe a lot of things this season to our fans.\"",

      "Manchester United fans travelling to Bilbao for tonight's Europa League final are being firmly advised: leave your vapes at home.",
      "The San Mamés Stadium, the iconic ground of Athletic Bilbao and host of this major European clash, has enforced a strict ban on e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products. Supporters who fail to comply could face ejection, fines, or even intervention from local police.",
      "For United, this final is about more than just silverware - it's a shot at redemption after a frustrating season. Securing the Europa League title would also mean qualification for next year's Champions League, an unexpected reward given their poor domestic form.",
      "The match is expected to draw up to 80,000 travelling fans to Bilbao, a picturesque Basque city with a population of around 350,000. While vaping is legal across Spain, San Mamés has implemented tighter regulations for tonight's final.",
      "Fans heading to the game need to take special care: those caught vaping inside the stadium risk being thrown out, fined on the spot, or reported to law enforcement. Dan Marchant, director of Vape Club and founding member of the UK Vaping Industry Association (UKVIA), issued a clear message to United fans. \"If vaping is banned in the venue you're travelling to, it's best not to risk a fine or worse,\" he said.",
      "\"Fans heading to Bilbao for the Europa League final need to be especially careful. Those attempting to enter with prohibited items could face eviction and be reported to the police.\"",
      "He also noted: \"Vaping within the stadium is prohibited, though there may be a designated smoking area. Check ahead of time, and don't risk using your vape in non-designated areas.\"",
      "San Mamés has also banned a wide range of other items. Fans are forbidden from bringing unauthorised photo and video equipment, face coverings such as ski masks or balaclavas, drones, oversized banners (over two metres), food, alcohol, drugs, weapons, flares, fireworks, megaphones, laser pens, glass or plastic bottles, backpacks, and large bags.",
      "United come into this final with plenty to prove. Their Premier League campaign has been woeful - they currently sit 16th in the table, hovering just above the drop zone. Dogged by injuries and inconsistent performances, this game represents both a chance to end the season on an unexpected high and to secure a way back into Europe's elite tournament.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side stormed into the final with a dominant 7-1 aggregate win over Athletic Bilbao. Victory tonight would make it three trophies in three years for the Red Devils, following last year's FA Cup success and the League Cup win in 2023.",
      "By contrast, tonight could deepen the crisis at Tottenham, where boss Ange Postecoglou is reportedly on thin ice. There is speculation that even a Europa League triumph may not secure his future at the club.",
      "Spurs booked their place in the final with a 3-1 semi-final win against Bodo/Glimt. Although they, too, have had a troubled domestic season - currently 17th in the Premier League - this final offers them a rare chance to end a 17-year trophy drought dating back to their 2008 League Cup win.",
      "For United fans making the trip, tonight is about more than just football. It's a potential turning point after a year of setbacks - and they'll want to avoid any missteps off the pitch, especially those that could get them ejected for something as simple as a vape."

      "United take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao (8pm kick-off). The winners will not only lift European silverware but will also be awarded a place in the Champions League next season, meaning victory in Bilbao comes with a lucrative prize attached to it as well.",
      "Like United, Spurs have had a disappointing domestic season. Ange Postecoglou’s side sit in 17th place in the table, one place and one point below United.",
      "The Champions League would be a huge boost to either team both financially and in attracting players in the upcoming transfer window. But United could potentially have a problem should they qualify.",
      "French outfit Nice, also currently owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos, secured their spot in the competition through a fourth place finish in Ligue 1. But UEFA rules could potentially see one or both teams prevented from playing in the competition.",
      "Here’s a roundup of the latest ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "UEFA rules state that no two clubs under the same control could compete in any two European competitions together. They have however since been updated so that the rules only apply to teams in the same tournament.",
      "Given Nice’s qualification for the Champions League, that could present a problem for United should they beat Tottenham.",
      "In a statement, UEFA have said that: \"No one is simultaneously involved, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition; and no one has control or decisive influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\"",
      "Therefore there needs to be proof that the two clubs are not run simultaneously.",
      "Due to the increasing nature of multi-club ownership models, UEFA now handle the situation on a case-by-case basis.",
      "An example is Manchester City and Girona, who are both owned by the City Group, were allowed to both compete in the Champions League this season. United and Nice were also both allowed to compete in the Europa League in the current season.",
      "This was made possible after shares after investors transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure. This meant effective control and decision-making at these clubs were solely under control of the trustee.",
      "This agreement is due to end on July 1 this year, however, meaning another solution may need to be found. As reported by MEN Sport, United are confident that they will be allowed to compete in the Champions League despite Nice’s qualification for the competition.",
      "Ratcliffe has been talking to UEFA since taking over at United and has been encouraged by the discussions.",
      "Following its decision in 2024 to allow Man City and Girona FC, as well as Manchester United and OGC Nice to compete in European competition, UEFA released a statement which read: \"The First Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB First Chamber) had previously opened proceedings involving: Girona FC (ESP) and Manchester City FC (ENG); and Manchester United FC (ENG) and OGC Nice (FRA) due to a potential conflict with the multi-club ownership rule provided for in Article 5 of the UEFA club competitions regulations.",
      "\"Following the implementation of significant changes by the concerned investors in Girona FC and OGC Nice (respectively City Football Group and INEOS), the CFCB First Chamber accepted the admission of Girona FC and Manchester City FC to the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League as well as Manchester United FC and OGC Nice to the 2024/25 UEFA Europa League. The clubs were able to demonstrate that such changes brought them into compliance with the multi-club ownership rule, considering that:",
      "\"More specifically, the significant changes made to the ownership, governance, and financial support of the concerned clubs, substantially restrict the investors’ influence and decision-making power over more than one club, ensuring compliance with the multi-club ownership rule during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"In particular, the concerned investors have transferred their shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice to independent trustees through a blind trust structure established under the supervision of the CFCB First Chamber. Such blind trust was accepted by the CFCB First Chamber on an exceptional basis for the 2024/25 UEFA competitions. The trustees will regularly exchange information with the CFCB First Chamber during the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"As a result, the following applies at the level of Girona FC and OGC Nice for the 2024/25 season:",
      "\"Furthermore, as additional evidence of their independence, the concerned clubs committed to the following:",
      "\"From 1 July 2025, the shares in Girona FC and OGC Nice will be transferred back to their respective investor. As a result, in the absence of any major modifications to the clubs’ shareholding, governance or financing, the above-mentioned clubs shall be considered, as from that date, under the control or decisive influence of their investor.",
      "\"The CFCB First Chamber will continue to monitor the above-mentioned situations to ensure that the multi-club ownership rule continues to be complied with during the 2024/25 season.\"",
      "Speaking on the situation, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given a clear answer. \"No, there are no circumstances upon which an ownership of Nice would prevent Manchester United from playing in the Champions League. I’ll be crystal clear on that,\" he said.",
      "\"It says you have to change the ownership structure, you know. So it’s all about influence and positions on the board and that sort of thing. A: the rules are changing, and B: there are shades of grey not black and white. Manchester City will probably have the problem before we have the problem because they’ve obviously got Girona.",
      "\"We have spoken to UEFA and I have to say the conversation wasn’t directed at, 'you have to solve this problem and you know we don’t like it'. We have an issue and we might have to change some things. But what they do recognise is that the multi-club model in many circumstances benefits the smaller club quite a lot.",
      "\"They do have a concern that if they stop the multi-club model then you take away quite a lot from the smaller club. Because the smaller club benefits a lot from the bigger club. So that’s a good thing. But what they’re worried about is if there’s ever an accusation that somebody influences the result of a game - lack of integrity. That’s the most concerning thing.",
      "\"We’ve never spent time really understanding the benefits of a multi-club. But we’ve got Omar obviously, who’s been intimately involved in a really successful multi-club, which is Manchester City. So we need to spend a bit of time with Omar trying to understand it a bit better before we finish up with a view.",
      "\"I think my inclination is positive towards multi-clubs, not negative towards multi-clubs. We haven’t spent enough time understanding all the details of it yet. Also, the UEFA thing is changing so you have to do it in the light of where you think UEFA is going to finish up, what the handicaps are. There are obviously handicaps involved.\"",

      "The 24-year-old midfielder has confirmed he will leave Lille at the end of next month when his contract expires, bringing an end to a four-year spell at the club. Gomes joined the Ligue 1 club on a free transfer in 2020, following the expiry of his contract at Old Trafford.",

      "The Mirror adds that the United academy graduate wants to assess all his potential options, with Tottenham also said to be interested. Other top-flight sides are still in the mix. Marseille, on the other hand, consider Gomes as a 'key target', according to the report.",
      "Announcing his departure from Lille, Gomes wrote: \"After four unforgettable years at LOSC Lille, it’s time for me to say goodbye. This club has been more than just a team — it’s been a family, a home, and a place that has shaped me both on and off the pitch.",
      "\"Like any journey, there were ups and downs, highs and lows, but I’m truly grateful to my teammates and the fans for sticking with me throughout. I’m proud of what we achieved together and thankful for every moment. To the fans — thank you for your amazing support and for believing in me.",

Ahead of the final, transfer rumours have been floating around United regularly and while Matheus Cunha looks all but a done deal, some bits of business seem a bit further away from completion.",
      "In our look at the latest transfer news, we focus on the goalkeeper position and how that could be changing at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "After his emotional goodbye at Villa Park on Friday night, talkSPORT understands Emiliano Martinez is a player of interest for United. It is claimed that both the Reds and Atletico Madrid hold an interest in the Argentine who won the Yashin Trophy for world's best goalkeeper in the past two seasons.",
      "The report claims that Aston Villa are looking for £40m and United would only be able to afford the deal if they sell Andre Onana.",
      "What MEN Sport says: Martinez has undoubtedly been a good goalkeeper for Villa and Argentina. With four years remaining on his contract in the West Midlands, a £40m price tag seems understandable. However, United should probably avoid splashing such high amounts on ageing players. Martinez is 32 and while he could play for longer as a goalkeeper, it seems like a move that the Glazers would have green lit and very few of those paid off. Plus, while Onana has not been consistent this season, there are bigger priorities than replacing him.",
      "Speaking of Onana, TEAMtalk understands that United are offering out the Cameroonian ahead of the summer window. It is believed that United are actively seeking to sell the shot stopper and see Martinez as his perfect replacement.",
      "Neom SC, who will be playing in the Saudi Pro League next season, have reportedly been contacted over the possibility of signing Onana. However, it is thought that his high wage, even for Saudi clubs, is making many interested parties sceptical of submitting an offer.",
      "What MEN Sport says: If United can get £40m for Onana and use that money to purchase Martinez, that would be the only acceptable way to sign the 'keeper. They would make a profit on a signing who has flattered to deceive while also signing one of the world's best in the process. However, when the attack at United has yet to be resolved, questions surely still remain as to whether looking for a new goalkeeper is a good use of the recruitment team's efforts."

      "United aren't alone in the race for Gyokeres with Arsenal reportedly in pole position. It's been claimed that new sporting director Andrea Berta had made the former Coventry City star his number one target ahead of the summer to bolster Mikel Arteta's attack.",
      "However, United continue to be tipped to reunite Gyokeres with Amorim should they win the Europa League on Wednesday. Victory in Bilbao will secure their spot in the Champions League and fund their transfer plans in the summer.",
      "United are intending to make Wolves star Matheus Cunha their first signing of the summer with the club expected to trigger his £62.5million release clause. Another new attacker is expected to be signed before the start of the next campaign.",
      "Now, according to L'Equipe in France, United will push ahead with their move for Gyokeres once Wednesday night's all-English European final is played. The report adds that their pursuit remains \"very active\" and they will \"accelerate\" their attempts to bring the striker to Manchester.",
      "It's claimed that Arsenal are taking their time in sending their first formal offer and Paris Saint-Germain have removed themselves from the race. The French outlet state that United are \"the first major European club to have made a concrete move\"."

      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",

      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",

      "And unlike other Daily Mail fears, this one is not entirely unfounded. There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",
      "… the amalgam of both, the action dominating with the reassuring-as-old-slippers insight of the pundits as an accompaniment. This diet is distinct from both the protracted analysis of Sky’s ‘main event’ and the unvarnished 10-second video clip trotting across personal smartphones.",

      "Please, can someone explain to us what on earth ‘wokery’ even means in this context?",

Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him.

When it continues like this, you see it every weekend the blocking goalkeeper – if the Premier League doesn’t find a clear rule it will end in a different sport. In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",

There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions.

When my player is sprinting one-on-one with the goalkeeper and someone pushes from behind, it’s almost impossible…it’s difficult to accept how the decision on the field was like that. It was clear for me and for you. We have to respect the decision but it had a massive impact in the game. If it’s a penalty, he should’ve been sent off, he didn’t try to play the ball. In that moment it’s a clear penalty and a clear red card,” he said.",

That [Jones initially signalling that Gibbs-White had won the ball] was the mess. But let’s hope they improve and we continue. I don’t want to see it as a problem.

      "Before Carragher chimed in: “If the Tottenham [Hotspur] players weren’t injured, then it could have been a 50/50 chance of them winning. I still think that Manchester United will win. Not being able to bring someone off the bench for Tottenham doesn’t really help.”",

      "“Their interviews will be along the lines of them saying that they’re so happy and delighted for the fans, but it’s been a difficult season. That will be the tone of it. I don’t think there should be a parade through the city for them winning the Europa League.”",

      "Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation and his loss of form won’t stop the vultures circling, and £30million still feels like a bargain. Especially for a striker who is, by all accounts, a slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "8) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that. As could Florian Wirtz, Alejandro Grimaldo, Jonathan Tah, Piero Hincapie and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",

      "Of the many areas Manchester United need to strengthen this summer, goalkeeper is the position they will most resent having to address.",
      "Andre Onana should have been United’s No. 1 for a decade; that was the plan when the Red Devils spent £43.7million on the Cameroonian in 2023 to replace David De Gea and, to be fair to the recruitment ‘brains trust’ at Old Trafford at the time, there was very little dissent over their pick.",
      "Onana was viewed as a safe set of hands with two feet that would help United play the Ten Hag way, a concept that remains a mystery. The ex-Ajax keeper had just helped Inter Milan get to the Champions League final and the decision to give him De Gea’s gloves was overwhelmingly well-received by everyone bar De Gea.",
      "The recent revisionism around De Gea highlights how far short Onana has come to matching those early expectations. Despite the Spaniard’s success at Fiorentina – after a season’s sabbatical – the decision to replace De Gea was absolutely correct. Their choice of replacement – in glorious hindsight – was not.",
      "We’ll give him a pass on the fact he hasn’t improved United in possession. Sometimes, a goalkeeper building out from the back is only as good as the players he’s passing to. As we know, many of his team-mates just aren’t up to receiving the ball under pressure, from either high-pressing opponents or the millions scrutinising them across the globe.",
      "That doesn’t excuse some of Onana’s clumsiness, especially when playing longer. But his real failings are rooted in the more traditional expectation of an elite goalkeeper: be hard to beat. Save the shots you’re expected to save, and some that you’re not.",
      "His two seasons in the United goal have been riddled with mistakes. Not just basic handling errors, but some inexplicable decision-making and highly-questionable techniques. One example: his approach to one-on-ones – stay deep, sit down – can’t be one that any of the Carrington goalkeeping coaches and analysts endorse. And, assuming they have identified it, they haven’t corrected his habit of parrying into poor areas.",
      "The fact that United are in Bilbao right now, hoping to rescue a generationally-bad season with a trophy and a route into the Champions League via the back door, is in spite of Onana’s performances.",
      "As is the case with many of their failing players that need upgrading, getting Onana out of Old Trafford won’t be easy for United without almost giving him away. Really, they need to hope a sheikh in Saudi is blinded by his profile enough to ignore his flaws.",
      "With that comes another attempt at finding a goalkeeper capable, composed and confident enough to keep United’s goal.",
      "Recent days have seen the Red Devils linked with Emiliano Martinez. At first sight, it appears to be a solid match.",
      "Martinez, not long ago viewed by some as the best on the planet largely because of his role in making Argentina kings of the world, appears to possess the requisite confidence. Outwardly at least, he presents as a character big enough to handle the pressure of defending even United’s goal.",
      "But perhaps we shouldn’t be fooled by his bravado. It is entirely likely that Martinez is more sensitive and self-aware than Onana. The Argentina No.1 has spoken about how he has worked on portraying an image of infallibility; much of the arrogance is an act. Which is absolutely fine – goalkeepers do need to fake it if they aren’t feeling it. But we ought not to believe that Martinez is the outstanding candidate based purely on the character he plays.",
      "But you could argue that type of personality is not what United need at this stage of whatever trauma it is they are currently going through. An attention-seeking egomaniac impatient with others’ imperfections would not lead a happy existence behind Ruben’s reds right now.",

      "The game doesn’t produce many goalkeepers with those traits anymore. Modern keepers tend to carry a calmer authority, more in the mould of Alisson than Schmeichel or Kahn.",
      "Plenty still skirt close to the edge, but the likes of Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale have worked hard to train their chimp rather than allow it to fling faeces while swinging from the goalposts.",
      "Martinez too has tweaked his mindset and persona on the way to becoming one of the Premier League’s best, channelling the frustration of being overlooked at Arsenal towards oozing the confidence that helped Argentina to a third star. It worked for him then. But that doesn’t mean it will work at Old Trafford.",
      "He doesn’t have to act the d*ck now. The chip on his shoulder from being binned by Arsenal ought to have been smoothed by a World Cup winner’s medal and various individual honours thrusted from his groin that vindicate him from whatever doubts plagued him. It’s a matter of opinion whether Martinez is the best in the Premier League/Europe/world, but he’s rightly in all those conversations. That should be enough to facilitate the evolution from manufactured arrogance to supreme and justified confidence.",
      "United need much more of the latter than the former. Of course, Villa will have plenty to say about Martinez’s next steps. Shipping to Saudi is a very different prospect to selling to a domestic rival, if United can still be labelled that. Without making it worth their while, there is certainly more in a move for United than Villa.",
      "Which leads us to believe it perhaps won’t happen, especially if United are turned over by Tottenham in the Battle of the Banter Clubs. Regardless of the outcome in Bilbao, persisting with Onana is not an option for a serious club if United are hoping to be viewed as one again in the near future. The Cameroonian must be replaced, by an experienced, proven stopper. And Martinez ticks most of their boxes.",

      "And unlike with Spurs, whose own league efforts are somehow even worse, there is not the same sense at United that a trophy – any trophy – makes everything worth it. United don’t need another season where the cracks of wretched league form are papered over with a trophy. They had one of those last season, and have spent this season paying for it.",
      "But what beating Tottenham in Bilbao might do for Man United is far more significant than the outcome of a single season. This, really, feels like where the divergence exists between these two finalists who sit next to each other so miserably back at home.",
      "Both can point to a vast discrepancy between their Premier League and Europa League form. Both have, correctly and inevitably, prioritised this competition at further cost to already ruined domestic campaigns.",
      "Both have made it abundantly clear where their priorities have been for months now.",
      "But with Spurs this feels like an opportunistic chance for catharsis, to cast off a banter albatross at long, long last and move on with their lives. On its own, the Europa League final perhaps means more for them, but as part of a wider plan it is United who face the bigger sliding doors moment in Bilbao.",
      "Win or lose, Spurs will reset and relaunch yet again under a new manager, who will be given some of the signings he needs yet by no means all. They will spend a year or two in transition, lose their nerve, and start the whole process again. It is the history of the Tottenham.",
      "United’s case is slightly different. They are in the early stages of one of their own frequent post-Fergie resets, one that involved bringing in a manager whose style of play is almost entirely at odds with the squad that’s been left at his disposal.",
      "While Ange Postecoglou will surely leave Spurs win or lose, Amorim surely stays. What alters with victory here is the potential speed and scope of the rebuild he badly needs this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s move to Old Trafford is welcome, and shows that even in their current reduced and sorry state United remain a draw for players with what are, on paper, better choices.",
      "But there is no doubt that the financial and footballing benefits of being able to offer Champions League football will make United’s other wooing missions this summer that bit easier.",
      "Bluntly, even as wretched as they are now, United in the gutter are still looking at the stars. Given the right tools and opportunity, Amorim remains a manager capable of restoring them to something like their rightful place in English football even after his unnecessarily chaotic and poorly-timed arrival.",
      "For Spurs, Wednesday night in Bilbao is a destination in itself. A release of emotion and frustration akin to that we’ve already seen this season for Newcastle and Crystal Palace.",
      "For United, though, it represents more of a stepping stone. They’ll enjoy the night if it goes their way, of course, but it won’t even be the first time they’ve won this trophy in the post-Fergie wilderness years.",
      "The flipside, of course, is that defeat comes with dread consequences and further erosion of an already significantly depleted aura.",
      "While victory represents a potentially transformative springboard for Amorim and the club, defeat will leave them as not only the Manchester United team that finished 16th – or maybe even worse – in the Premier League but also the one that handed a trophy to Tottenham.",
      "This one game comes to early in Amorim’s reign to definitively make or break him right now, but it still feels like when his United career comes to be judged, the result of this one game will be a pivotal moment in setting its overall course."

      "Nine Man Utd players who should leave this summer\nFollowing the season United have had, where it’s honestly been such a drag watching some games, it makes you think how United have somehow gone from 8th place last year in the league with Ten Hag at the helm (which was deemed as disastrous), to 16th in the league this year. It proves some players are just rubbish and there for the paycheck. There isn’t really an excuse for it to be finishing not only in the lower half of the table, but to be finishing below 15th place, is brutally shite.",
      "I have no idea how the team are somehow the only unbeaten side in Europe this season, but it looks like Amorim does have a few tricks up his sleeve in European competition, but has to improve drastically in the Premier League next season otherwise he will probably get sacked. Truth be told, I wish the whole board would just get sacked, with former United players and those who understand the standards of the club to take their place, but Ratcliffe and the Glazers are the ones in charge and it doesn’t look like that will change any time soon…",
      "If the owners actually had some sense of responsibility and courage, and the manager must communicate this as well, they need to have a serious conversation with some of the players at the club and insist on putting them on the transfer list. And if United can’t sell them due to the ridiculous salaries they are on, at least loan them and agree a deal with another club to pay for 40-50% of their wage. The players who need to leave are the following.",
      "Luke Shaw: This player is honestly so lucky to have been at United for the last 11 years. Yes its unfortunate how his leg injury ruined his potential and his fitness, but United should have gotten rid of Shaw years ago. Not reliable or good enough and did have a few good years, but it’s time to go.",
      "Jonny Evans: Did we seriously just sign him to keep Tom Heaton some company? Pointless signing.",
      "Victor Lindelof: Actually rate him quite a lot as a defender and player, and built a somewhat solid partnership with Maguire over the years, but should try and head back to somewhere like Benfica or a mid-table club in Italy/Spain.",
      "Diogo Dalot: I think he had a great year last season, but very big downfall this year. If United can get 35-40 million for him, sell him as he isn’t good enough defensively, has headless chicken vibes.",
      "Christian Eriksen: I thought he was excellent in his first year at United and was just as good as Casemiro in that first year under Ten Hag, but time for him to leave on a free and enjoy last few years at another club.",
      "Jadon Sancho: No explanation needed, came for money and incredibly overrated. Loan him again if necessary.",
      "Marcus Rashford: Looks like he needs a new start, and if United can sell him for a reasonable amount of money, they should sell him and it’s a big salary amount off the books too.",
      "Antony: Has proven that United really were the problem, need to convince Real Betis to sign him for around 30 million and looks to suit La Liga much more than the Premier League.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: I do think the criticism of him has been somewhat unfair, but is he good enough to score 15-20 goals a season? He just looks so uncomfortable up front and should head back to Italy where the game seemed to suit him more. Would make a big loss on him given the price paid for, but should cash in and sign another striker.",
      "I would arguably include Mason Mount as part of this list due to his injury issues, but only came in two seasons ago. Knowing United, they won’t even sell half of the players listed here, and it will be the same vicious circle of an ‘Average’ summer of transfers. 8-9 players must be sold/loaned out this summer, a large chunk of players need to leave the club before bringing in new blood. If the owners don’t realise that, then Amorim will eventually pay the price and the same thing will happen to United where they bring in a manager for 2 years max and change it up when the owners feel like it/are bored.",

      "There are some positives though…\nSo here we stand on the precipice of glory or failure. Win and the season will be marginally acceptable, lose and it will be confirmed a disastrous campaign. This goes for both teams, and the fact Spurs have got the better of us thrice this season makes me incredibly nervous (albeit the two under RA were close affairs). Which United will turn up – Ruby’s Euro diamonds or Ruben’s relegation-hunting rejects?",
      "The league season was a write-off a good couple of months ago, so I can understand some sluggish league performances. We haven’t won since March but, Newcastle aside, most matches have been fairly evenly contested. But this doesn’t make it acceptable, and Ruben has said as much.",
      "Of course the manager has to take some flak, that comes with the territory, but we have known for some time that the squad isn’t good enough regardless of what system is being played – this doesn’t necessarily mean they are all “bad” players individually, just as a collective it hasn’t worked, and changes were and are needed.",
      "I like Hojlund, but he isn’t ready to lead the line for us every week and is still learning the game and how to deal with the pressure of being at one of the world’s biggest clubs – he needs to be a 1 in 2 striker, and it remains to be seen if he can hit those numbers.",
      "Garnacho will be a fine player, but he isn’t a wingback or a #10, so doesn’t suit the system; he has improved but, again, is not ready to play there week in week out. I don’t want us to sell him but might be necessary.",
      "Our wingbacks, key positions in this system, have not delivered consistently – injuries explain some of this but, regardless, we need players there who can defend, attack and stay fit! Dorgu looks a good buy but is still raw, not sure Amass will make it with us but we’ll see. Malacia who? Dalot gives 100% but isn’t consistent in attack, he should stick to the edge of the box cutbacks as they are his most effective deliveries, and Mazraoui looks more at home as the right CB. Most of our quality in MF is aging and our GK loves a mistake. So other than that, it’s all good.",
      "It’s not all doom and gloom, Maguire continues to look good in a 3, Yoro looks a player, Diallo has come back as sharp, Zirkzee has shown some flashes and Bruno is Bruno. Mount has even stayed fit for longer than 3 matches. We will add to the squad in the summer (Cunha would be perfect, would love Mbeumo but can’t see it), there are some promising youth players to come through and the players we keep will have more of an idea of what is expected of them.",
      "The point being, talk of getting rid of Amorim at this stage is madness. He will know that next season brings less patience, and his methods have to be seen to be working in the league as that is our bread and butter. A trophy and CL place would, however, be a start and buy him some further support.\nGarey (come on United!!) Vance, MUFC",

      "See, every yin needs a yang, every Barcelona needs a Real Madrid, every Batman needs a Joker. Rivalries make competitions better. Liverpool against Man Utd IS English football, anything else is just tofu burger – not the real thing. Arsenal fans are empty vessels, City has no fans, Chelsea is a punchline these days.

      "Is Frimpong that odd of a potential signing?\nYouth development is never linear; as good as Bradley has been, he isn’t consistent. Defensively he was excellent against Mbappe and bloody terrible against Martinelli. He’s been Cafu incarnate going forward, whilst also showing the inadequacies of Abel Xavier in some moments.",
      "For every youth prospect that excels, like a Gravenberch, there’s a youth prospect that excels and then stalls, like Bajcetic. Both may well thrive, but relying on one was foolhardy and didn’t work and relying on the other did work – though entirely out of luck rather than judgement.",
      "There is a difference between giving youth a chance with an opportunity that’s still safe to fail, and relying on youth and then their struggles hamper the whole team, the compounding pressure of that then destroys their career.",
      "Gravenberch saved the day this season but it was a forced gamble, rather than a plan that should be scaled. Beyond that, perpetually play a kid in every game, and you’ll break them as LFC did with Owen and Arteta may well do with Saka.",
      "The interesting thing about Frimpong is, if he is signed, it’d obviously provide competition for Connor Bradley, but given his attacking output, it’d not be out of the question for both to play on the right hand side. Frimpong strikes me as another potential Riise, who can play on the wing or as full back.",
      "And to that end, Salah has rightly earned a new contract, but this season has indicated a degree of burnout by April. If a season is 50+ games long, with minutes available at right wing and right back, then 40+ starts for Frimpong across both roles, and 20 + sub appearances for Connor at full back is still good squad management, and that’s discounting injuries. I’m likely mis-remembering but I recall Arsenal playing Eboue as a winger, and didn’t Saka start out as a full back before moving forward? I’m sure it’s been done before, it’s just my memory is failing me.",
      "Not everyone’s career ends up like Gareth Bale’s but the prospect of playing an attacking full back further forward isn’t entirely new, and not entirely unsuccessful. Riise was instrumental in Istanbul after all.",
      "Final thing would be that at circa thirty million, in today’s world of utterly ludicrous prices, that’s not too extravagant, and albeit losing Trent for buttons is a huge dropped-bollock, having two people replace him for an all-in cost of 30 million does repair that damage somewhat.",
      "I can empathise with the argument F365 are making about saving your transfer kitty till you know if a target is available. The inverse to that logic though is your main target’s price tag could/would swell to fill your entire budget if you wait forever, as your negotiating position is reduced: folks will know how much money you have.",
      "If LFC kept their powder dry, then Newcastle could argue they want the whole fee for Isaak up front. If LFC bring in two fullbacks relatively quickly, they could make the case to Newcastle that they’d be ‘happy’ adding extra onto the fee, but need to defer the installments across 18 months or longer etc – basically negotiating. (notwithstanding that i don’t think Isaak will move this window, just using him as an example as you did).",
      "I’d hope that with the sales of Darwin, Chiesa, Tsimikas, Kellegher, and Jota, and the departure of Trent, and the rumours of an exit for Endo and Elliot, that the club would have budget and wage bill capacity to do what they need to. If the signing of an ‘extra’ full back negates that, then as much as I really can’t be arsed with the manic fringe of the FSG-out brigade, some questions would realistically need to be asked as to where the money is. And Frimpong looks a decent buy if the club can get it sorted.\nTom",

      "On Joel Ward. Or why Palace are 12th\nYes, I’m still overwhelmed by the FA Cup Final. Details keep coming back to me, like seeing Paddy McCarthy from the 2010 survival side squaring up to one of Manchester City’s medical team, or the fact that victory was secured with two important players (Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton) requiring substitution due to head injuries.",
      "However, the dominant memory at the moment is what happened immediately before the cup presentation. Last week it was announced that Joel Ward, the longest-serving member of the current Crystal Palace squad, would be leaving the club when he contract expires in the summer.",
      "Clearly we all missed a memo because we didn’t plaster Selhurst with posters calling him a Judas, forcing him to pick “loyalty or lolly”, sending death threats to him and his family on social media and demanding the Joel Ward mural be painted over – that’s what you’re supposed to do when a long-serving right-back announces they’re leaving at the end of their contract, isn’t it?",
      "Ward joined the club from Portsmouth in 2012, leaving a side that had been relegated from the Championship for one that had finished 17th, for a fee of £400,000. The following season he made 25 appearances as Palace were promoted to the Premier League, and prior to this campaign made that many or more appearances in nine out of eleven seasons. Arguably the dictionary definition of a reliable if unspectacular full back, there is no denying that he has been one of the best value for money signings of the past 15 years – particularly as his arrival, with Palace just a year or so out of administration, meant they had to sell players in order to fund his acquisition.",
      "In a way, he’s a good example of why Palace finish roughly 12th every year. A more ruthless club would have cut Ward loose a long time ago, replaced him with someone younger, cheaper and with personal ambition in abundance that can be translated into ambition for the team. And yet, he’s still here, because as Steve Parish has said in interviews about other players, he wants to do right by the person behind the player; he knows that Ward, like Paddy McCarthy or Damien Delaney before him, still has leadership and experience to contribute to the group and its younger members even if he isn’t playing every week.",
      "Some clubs, or at least the very online people among their supporters, will see this as excessive sentimentality that holds Palace back, but it isn’t, it’s just humans being considerate to each other.",
      "And then we get to Saturday, when Ward and Guehi get to lift the FA Cup together, the first people to ever do that in Crystal Palace colours. It was a fantastic moment and something so richly deserved for someone who has done so much for the club for so long. Not being someone to actively seek the spotlight made it all the better that he got to be front and centre at the greatest moment in the club’s history – the greatest moment in the club’s history so far. Go well, Wardy.\nEd Quoththeraven",
      "",
      "Giving the promoted clubs a chance\nSimple solution, currently Premier League teams can only loan two Premier League players, what if say newly promoted sides were allowed up to 6 (then 4 in their second season and back to the default 2 in their third)? On the face of it wouldn’t it be a win-win? Newly promoted clubs get access to more Premier League level talent without the cost of transfer fees or locking in long-term expensive contracts, bigger clubs have more scope to give league minutes to players who need them (so currently all the promoted teams can only lend 6 between them, under this system you’d open up 24 more slots).",
      "You’d be less likely to end up with scenarios where players who desperately need the minutes, like Evan Ferguson end up going on loan to clubs who are taking them on as a spare rather than as a core part of their starting line up. I also would have an option for special appeal, wherein a club could make a case for exception circumstance on going over the set limit, this would leave the door open to late window options that turn up (like say a scenario where a player gets dramatically left out of the squad after a huge falling out and has nowhere to go).",
      "I’m aware that the sight of a team taking the field with majority players they don’t ‘own’ might be weird at first (and of course they don’t have to fill all their slots either), but surely it’d be preferable to the predictable churn of promoted sides in giving them a better fighting chance, and with more league teams in Europe than ever before and so needing deeper squads i can see how something like this could serve as a halfway house for players on the verge of the first team of higher tier sides to bridge the gap.",

      "Man Utd are now ready to sign “one more player in the No 10 position” in the summer transfer window, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Red Devils have had a nightmare season with Ruben Amorim’s side to go down as the worst Man Utd side to have played in the Premier League era.",
      "Incredibly, they still have an opportunity on Wednesday night to qualify for next season’s Champions League if they can beat Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao.",
      "Victory over Spurs would boost the Man Utd transfer budget and help them attract better players to the club that want to play in the Champions League.",
      "A deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is almost sealed with Romano giving his famous ‘here we go!’ confirmation on Monday.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘EXCL: Manchester United are now closing in on Matheus Cunha deal! The Brazilian has accepted the project as agreement on personal terms is now being finalised, almost done. Final details to sort between all parties involved… and then, here we go.’",
      "READ: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "Giving further details on Tuesday morning, Romano added: ‘More on Matheus Cunha exclusive story. Man United are set to approach also Wolves to proceed with £62.5m release clause payment in installments. The deal is almost done on player side as revealed yesterday, with final details being clarified. Cunha said YES.’",
      "But Man Utd are unlikely to stop there as Romano insists they are also looking to bring in “one more player” to play a number ten role in Amorim’s system.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: “My information is that Man Utd can also add one more player in the No 10 position. So to play behind the striker.",
      "“It is a possibility but it will be based on outgoings. So Cunha is expected to join and one more player [for the No 10 spots] depending on outgoings. This is the plan at Manchester United.”",
      "That man could be Lyon star Rayan Cherki with Football Insider insisting that Man Utd are ‘keen on a potential swoop’ for the France Under-23 international.",
      "The Red Devils are ‘weighing up a potential move’ but ‘will face stiff competition from European giants Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain’.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with Cherki and ex-Blues winger Florent Malouda gave his view on how the Frenchman could adapt to the Premier League.",
      "Malouda said earlier this month: “Simple answer: yes, he’s ready, but I want him to stay in Lyon and give us more years and to keep developing himself in Lyon. I think right now with this kind of talent, you could have PSG going for him in France.",
      "“He could have teams like Barcelona and in the Premier League he is a player I could see in a club like, like, Arsenal, like Man City. So in terms of talent, in terms of potential, he belongs to the Premier League. But I would delay. I want him to stay in Lyon.”",

      "Man Utd have asked Barcelona for a specific player in exchange for Marcus Rashford in order to complete a transfer this summer, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd boss Amorim played Rashford for the last time on December 12 against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League being leaving him out of every match until his eventual departure.",
      "Since joining Aston Villa in the winter transfer window, Rashford has been in brilliant form and has no doubt convinced the Villans to sign him in the summer if they can justify the outlay.",
      "But Unai Emery admitted, after Rashford produced a brilliant performance in a recent Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain, that it will be “difficult” for Aston Villa to sign him permanently.",

      "READ: Big Midweek: Europa League final, Heung-min Son, FA Cup winners Crystal Palace, Pep Guardiola",
      "“If he’s happy, we are happy. Then, of course, it depends on the circumstances and what happens in the next weeks, and (what we have) in the next year as well.”",
      "At the end of April it was revealed that it was now ‘highly likely’ that Rashford would miss the rest of the season at Aston Villa and the summer transfer speculation started in earnest.",
      "Barcelona have been linked multiple times recently with Rashford ‘given the green light’ to pursue a move to Barcelona this summer as Man Utd are keen to offload the England international.",

      "The Catalan giants ‘could close a swap deal’ with Man Utd with Rashford ‘back on Barca’s radar’ after proving that ‘he’s still a top-level star’.",
      "It is understood that ‘the option that has gained traction is to finalise a swap deal in which Ronald Araujo would be the other player, although he is not in the plans.’",
      "Whether in a swap deal for Rashford or not, the Uruguay international’s ‘departure is all but confirmed when the transfer window opens’.",
      "The report adds that Premier League giants Man Utd ‘still appears to be interested in taking him on, as they did in the past, when they even submitted a formal offer.’",
      "Earlier this month, Barcelona sporting director Deco admitted that the Catalan giants were missing strength in the wide areas of their side, something which Rashford could provide.",

      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",
      "Even if Amorim was absolutely justified in prioritising that back door into the Champions League when an unthinkable relegation was removed from the equation, he surely has enough coaching acumen and Manchester United the requisite ability in their ludicrously expensive squad to pull together more than 0.92 points per game.",
      "This historically sorry bunch of Premier League managers fared better throughout their careers than the Portuguese, who will slump beneath Ian Holloway, Micky Adams, Nigel Adkins, Steve Kean, Alex Neil and Egil Olsen in terms of points per game if Manchester United lose to Aston Villa on the final day.",
      "",
      "Dean Smith – 1.03 (126 points from 122 games with Aston Villa, Norwich and Leicester)\nThe reputation established and goodwill generated through his role as the layer of foundations upon which Aston Villa continue to build was wasted on two panicking mid-season appointments Smith might since regret.",
      "A very good manager of a team promoted from the Championship became the emergency contact twice engulfed by the flames of dumpster fires headed back down.",
      "His second and final full top-flight campaign at Villa does a fair amount of heavy lifting here, but even at Leicester he picked up nine points from eight games in the single greatest season of Premier League manager buffoonery.",
      "",
      "Gary O’Neil – 1.03 (91 points from 88 games with Bournemouth and Wolves)\nA Manchester United manager candidate at one stage, O’Neil might actually represent an upgrade on Amorim based on his work with Bournemouth and Wolves. But both have undeniably improved since he left.",
      "",
      "Ian Branfoot – 1.03 (68 points from 66 games with Southampton)\nNo club has had more permanent first-team managers in the Premier League era than Southampton but you always remember your first. And Branfoot will unfortunately always be remembered as the manager who dropped Matt Le Tissier, understandably struggled to replace Alan Shearer and deployed a direct, long-ball game to the bitter end.",
      "",
      "Jesse Marsch – 1.03 (33 points from 32 games with Leeds)\nThe American was ‘doomed to failure’ and ‘on a hiding to nothing’ after replacing Marcelo Bielsa at Elland Road, but only because he wasn’t very good. Marsch absolutely had his moments as Leeds manager, mind, steering them to safety, beating Chelsea, and winning at Anfield while mimicking Ali G.",
      "",
      "Roy Keane – 1.02 (54 points from 53 games with Sunderland)\nIt was reported at the time that Keane’s resignation as Sunderland manager ‘sparked celebration among the players’, with former Black Cats chairman Niall Quinn receiving his notice over text.",
      "The Irishman’s 100th and final game in charge was a 4-1 defeat to Bolton at the Stadium of Light, a result met with boos and which dropped Sunderland into the bottom three. What a shame Amorim wasn’t a pundit at the time. Keane had successfully fought relegation the year before and the Black Cats would do so again – under Ricky Sbragia.",
      "",
      "Dave Merrington – 1.00 (38 points from 38 games with Southampton)\nThe benefactor of the Manchester United ‘grey shirt’ game, Merrington inherited a sub-optimal situation as Southampton caretaker for a season in what will forever remain the only senior first-team coaching post of his career.",
      "Alan Ball’s summer departure for Manchester City might have caught Saints off guard but youth-team coach Merrington stepped in, secured survival on goal difference for a team which could not have expected a great deal more, and was replaced by Graeme Souness within the year for his efforts.",
      "",
      "Felix Magath – 1.00 (12 points from 12 games with Fulham)\nHas Amorim considered covering Lisandro Martinez’s knee in quark cheese yet?",
      "",
      "Xisco Munoz – 1.00 (7 points from 7 games with Watford)\nThere is precisely zero shame attached to being sacked by Watford, who felt that “recent performances strongly indicate a negative trend at a time when team cohesion should be visibly improving” when adding Munoz to their compensation payment direct debits.",
      "The Spaniard’s PPG record for the Hornets in the Premier League was actually better than that of replacement Claudio Ranieri (0.54) and Roy Hodgson (0.50), so it turns out he was holding that “negative trend” off.",
      "",
      "Freddie Ljungberg – 1.00 (5 points from 5 games with Arsenal)\nThe transition from Unai Emery to Mikel Arteta was not seamless and required a month-long middle man sacrifice. Ljungberg unselfishly stepped up to immolate his managerial prospects with two scrappy draws, a pair of defeats and a win over West Ham as Arsenal used and abused him.",
      "",
      "Danny Wilson – 0.97 (102 points from 105 games with Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday)\n“In my opinion it would be best for the club if Danny Wilson was to leave” was how Secretary of State for Education and Employment David Blunkett called for the termination of the Sheffield Wednesday manager’s employment in January 2000. Four Sheffield MPs demanded the change, the response to which was a Manager of the Month award before he was ultimately sacked in March.",
      "It is a matter of time until Ed Miliband calls for Amorim to go.",
      "",
      "Eddie Gray – 0.96 (26 points from 27 games with Leeds)\nPeter Reid delayed relegation but lasted just 22 games as Leeds manager, with Gray parachuted in as a Knows The Club appointment to rescue a side bottom with eight points after 12 matches. He could not turn things around and arrest an inexorable slide down the Football League, although his record was actually respectable in picking up more points than three teams.",
      "",
      "Dave Bassett – 0.95 (124 points from 130 games with Sheffield United, Nottingham Forest and Leicester)\nBassett was involved in all sorts of Premier League relegations, indeed still the most of any manager ever. Four seasons in the competition resulted in a hat-trick of 20th-placed finishes with different teams: Sheffield United in 1993/94, Nottingham Forest in 1998/99 and Leicester in 2001/02. But he did start with a Brian Deane-inspired win over Manchester United in August 1992.",
      "",
      "Brian Clough – 0.95 (40 points from 42 games with Nottingham Forest)\nWhile Clough ostensibly left Forest where he found them 18 years before in English football’s second tier, that rather overlooks a remarkable journey which included two European Cups, a First Division title and a bond with a worshipping fanbase which could not be broken by his overwhelming personal demons or the relegation which accompanied his retirement in 1993.",
      "",
      "Paul Jewell – 0.94 (130 points from 138 games with Bradford, Wigan and Derby)\nPerhaps unfairly tarnished by The Apocalypse Season at Derby, it is slightly strange that Jewell never could find top-flight roles again based on his successful fight against relegation with Bradford, seven years after which he took Wigan to a mid-table finish and League Cup final. But then he did pick up just five points in 24 games with those doomed Rams.",
      "",
      "Gary Megson – 0.94 (128 points from 136 games with West Brom and Bolton)\nIt was reported at the time of his sacking in March 2018 that Alan Pardew had phoned Megson and accused him of denying him his “new manager bounce” by leading the Baggies to a couple of spirited draws with Spurs and Newcastle as caretaker. How foolish of Amorim not to level the same charge at Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "The longest top-flight spell Megson had was at Bolton, who he guided to a draw with Bayern Munich and victory over Atletico Madrid. But “the fans didn’t like me and I don’t particularly like them either”.",

      "Malky Mackay – 0.94 (17 points from 18 games with Cardiff)\n“They had a lot of possession but we were deserved winners,” said Mackay after guiding Cardiff to a win over eventual champions Manchester City in August 2013. It would be best for everyone if no more messages from the Scot are divulged at this point, particularly of the text variety.",
      "",
      "Neil Warnock – 0.93 (104 points from 112 games with Sheffield United, QPR, Crystal Palace and Cardiff)\nWarnock was sensible enough with his private correspondence to be allowed to finish the job of relegating Cardiff, a feat he also accomplished with Crystal Palace and Sheffield United; he took each side to 18th so at least made it close. And QPR were outside the relegation zone when they sacked him in January 2012.",
      "",
      "Steve Cooper – 0.93 (62 points from 67 games with Nottingham Forest and Leicester)\nForest were 17th when they sacked Cooper in December 2023, while Leicester were 16th in November 2024 when they ended a relationship destined to never work. It doesn’t feel as though the Foxes will be playing in Europe any time soon.",
      "",
      "John Deehan – 0.93 (56 points from 60 games with Norwich)\nNorwich were seventh when Mike Walker jumped ship for Everton in January 1994; his assistant Deehan struggled to steady a ship which ultimately sank into the First Division 18 months later.",
      "",
      "Mauricio Pellegrino – 0.93 (28 points from 30 games with Southampton)\nA sign Southampton had massively lost their way and decided to simply appoint a portmanteau of two very good managers, Pellegrino was in charge for the protracted and controversial world-record sale of Virgil van Dijk, and most problematic of all, the £20m signing of the entirely hopeless Guido Carrillo. It went so well that Mark Hughes had to rescue Saints after a few months.",
      "A new report has revealed Manchester United’s ‘main reason’ for their decision on whether to sack Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",

      "Neville insists it’s too early to judge Amorim and Ratcliffe at Man Utd and picked the ‘six players minimum’ required in a Red Devils rebuild this summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has done nothing to suggest he can turn Man Utd around, while there is some laughter and anger about Man City."

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is set to join Man Utd at the end of the season; United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wants to play for United and SSN has been told the deal is almost agreed",
      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:18, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 09:09, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",

      "Monday 19 May 2025 22:42, UK",
      "Luis Castro’s long career began in Portugal’s fourth division and has seen him rise to become one of the most accomplished coaches in world football. Football has taken the Portuguese to four different countries, winning trophies in all four of them.",
      "He was the first man to win Portugal's second tier with a B team, finished sixth with little Chaves and took Vitoria Guimaraes into Europe. Castro then won the title in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk before embarking on a new adventure in South America.",
      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
