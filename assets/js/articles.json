      "Paul Scholes has backed Manchester United to win the Europa League as he attempted to compare the club's success in European competition to that of Real Madrid. United have won six European titles in their history.",
      "That includes the European Cup - now rebranded as the Champions League - on three occasions, the European Cup Winners' Cup once, the Europa League in 2017 and the European Super Cup in 1991.",
      "By contrast Madrid have 23 European titles to their name as the most successful club on the continent. Los Blancos have won the Europe's ultimate club prize an unrivalled 15 times, along with two UEFA Cups and six European Super Cups.",
      "But Scholes believes that the duo are alike in the fact that both can win big games in Europe even when they are not playing well. United have endured a dreadful campaign outside of the Europa League this season.",
      "They have still managed to reach the final of that competition though and will now face Tottenham in Bilbao at the end of the month. And Scholes has backed the Red Devils to go on and beat Spurs.",
      "\"When they aren't playing that well they can still go on and win European cups. I just feel the odds are slightly in Manchester United's favour. Although I do think Tottenham are a good side.\"",
      "United booked their place in the final by thrashing Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals. But they will now come up against a Spurs side who have beaten them three times already this season, with Ruben Amorim admitting his side face a difficult test.",
      "“It's the least we can do for these fans, for all the support that they gave us in this tough season. But I'm stressed already because of the final, because if you don't win it, in the end, it's nothing. So, we are happy to be there. Let's see,” he said.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a really good game. A little bit emotional because both teams are struggling a lot in the Premier League and want to win something. Two teams who play in the same league and know each other.",
      "\"It means a lot, not just to us but also for Tottenham. It means a lot, not just for me but also for Ange [Postecoglou], after this season. It's a massive game and I know it's going to be tough for the people in Bilbao because they wanted to play in the final at home.",
      "\"For all of our squad, it's really important to give something to our fans this season. First of all, if you in the odds, it's hard for a club to lose four times in a row, so we can’t think in that way. I think we have to have a full squad, that is really important.",
      "\"In the moments, I'm just worried about the next game, to try to manage everything, not to get injuries for the final. But again, we need to win it. If we don't win it, it's nothing, it means nothing for us, so let's see.\""

      "After Mason Mount had rubber-stamped Manchester United’s passage to the Europa League final with his first goal of the night, he stood in front of the Stretford End and cupped his ear. Maybe he was making a reference to the talk that he was the sort of expensive signing that symbolises the club’s failings in recent years.",
      "Or maybe, after the frustration brought on by his painful struggles with injury, he just wanted to hear the acclaim that signified a rare positive step in his Old Trafford career. Or maybe he was cheekily asking the crowd to show proper appreciation for the one moment of elite-class skill that turned a fairly mediocre United performance into a glorious procession to the final.",
      "Never mind that Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund .and Mount again would make it a crushing United victory on the night, it was Mount’s sublime turn and finish just under 20 minutes from the end that was the pivotal moment in a game that had been run by Athletic for a good hour or so.",
      "Quite frankly, United were pretty abysmal until Mount struck with an individual effort that was a reminder of why so many top coaches down the years have adored this wonderful footballer. And after that, Athletic went to pieces, as they had done in Bilbao.",
      "But for half an hour, there was not even a suggestion United might add to their three-goal advantage and the Bilbao breakthrough was hardly a surprise. But the mistake that gave the half-chance to Mikel Jauregizar was a surprise, coming, as it did, from Harry Maguire.",
      "The misplaced pass still looked unlikely to be too damaging but Jauregizar struck his effort nicely enough to beat Andre Onana’s delayed take-off. At least it gave United a nudge of urgency and they would have been level just before the break had Alejandro Garnacho not once again shown that he can be a scorer of great goals rather than a great goalscorer.",
      "Occasionally doing the spectacular is great, frequently doing the routine is better. And it should have been a routine finish when Patrick Dorgu put him in the clear but his attempt to send a chip over Julen Agirrezabala went badly awry.",
      "The miss meant a pervading sense of anxiety remained and that is why, just after the hour mark, Ruben Amorim opted for a triple change of personnel - Mount, Luke Shaw and Amad Diallo all entering the fray. The alterations had the desired effect, to say the least.",
      "And after Mount’s brilliance and Casemiro’s quick-thinking finish, Diallo’s directness enabled him to set up Rasmus Hojlund, who, literally, only had to let the assist hit his foot to get on the scoresheet. Three-one and even Hojlund scored.",
      "Whether or not it was worthy of a celebratory selfie is open for debate but the man who should have been posing for photos finished the job in quite remarkable fashion. When a clearance reached Mount just inside the Athletic half he responded with a first-time, left-footed hit that must have travelled a good 50 yards or so.",
      "Both of Mount’s goals were a measure of a talent that, for reasons beyond the player’s control, Old Trafford has yet to enjoy. Here, that talent has made sure United have an endgame of a European final … but for Mount himself, this will, hopefully, be a new beginning."

United are keen on adding a new centre-forward this summer following a nightmare domestic campaign that could still end with continental success in the Europa League.",
      "And reaching the Champions League will have a big say on how much money is available to spend in the summer transfer window. Fall short and United may struggle to attract big name talent without selling on some of their current stars.",

      "Manchester United will face Tottenham in an all-English Europa League final after staving off a comeback from Athletic Bilbao. The Red Devils went into this semi-final second leg at Old Trafford with a command 3-0 lead, having romped to victory in Spain last Thursday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were firm favourites to advance but when Harry Maguire played a sloppy pass which was cut out by Bilbao and punished in style by Mikel Jauregizar, United looked far less confident. Their nerves were on show at the start of the second half and it took a triple change from Amorim to turn the tide.",
      "One of those substitutes, Mason Mount, scored the crucial goal to restore the Red Devils' three-goal lead on aggregate, the best moment of his United career to date - and his first goal at Old Trafford. Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund then got in on the act with a goal each, as Amorim & Co. continued their unbeaten run in Europe and sealed a place in the final against Spurs.",
      "Two minutes of stoppage time looked a formality but Mount doubled up with a sensational strike from distance, making it 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "Here are six talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "A team on the verge of a European final and a team desperate for a comeback was always going to have the makings of a cracking atmosphere ahead of kick-off. Manchester United allowed fans to display another tifo like ahead of last month's quarter-final second leg at home to Lyon while fireworks were set off to engulf the stadium in smoke.",
      "With banners unfurled in the Stretford End, Old Trafford looked a picture - and it about the most interesting thing we got until Patrick Dorgu went down in the penalty area after 23 minutes. Dorgu went tumbling over after contact from Andoni Gorosabel and a VAR check took place, but German referee Daniel Siebert wasn't instructed to review his decision of no penalty.",
      "The hero of that Lyon game, Harry Maguire, played the role of villain as Bilbao took the lead on the night and gave themselves an inkling of hope. His sloppy pass was too far in front of Leny Yoro and after Alvaro Djalo's initial shot was blocked, Mikel Jauregizar picked up the ball from more than 20 yards out and unleashed a superb strike which nestled in the top right-hand corner.",
      "Jauregizar's goal sent the away end wild, as the men from the Basque country took the first step towards an unlikely comeback just after half-hour mark. The nerves immediately set in for United fans, who'd been through nearly every emotion possible the last time they were here on a European night.",
      "What would've settled the nerves was a goal and United had plenty of chances in the first half. The best fell to Alejandro Garnacho on the brink of half-time, as Dorgu slid him through on goal and Old Trafford held its breath.",
      "Left of the 'keeper? Right? Through his legs? What would Garnacho do? Instead, he chose the option that no one was anticipating. The United winger tried to dink the ball over Julen Agirrezabala and got it horribly wrong, as the Bilbao goalkeeper was able to watch it drift wide.",
      "Shades of Danny Welbeck against Bayern Munich in 2014. Would the Red Devils suffer the same outcome?",
      "There's no clearer sign of a game going wrong than an angry manager making a triple change. After a woeful start to the second half, Ruben Amorim turned to his substitutes and brought on Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Amad.",
      "The Red Devils boss was visibly unhappy with how his team were failing to keep the ball, as Bilbao grew in confidence with sustained attacks. Amorim's men had ceded full control and needed to turn the tide quickly, as the visitors also made three changes - in much more positive fashion - at the same time.",
      "After Garnacho had emulated Welbeck, Mount found a better finish to copy. Amorim's changes instantly reinvigorated United and one of them proved particularly vital.",
      "Mount, whose United career has had far more lows than highs, swivelled on the ball inside the penalty area and curled the ball with his right foot past the sprawling Agirrezabala. Robbie Savage likened it to Federico Macheda's goal against Aston Villa in 2009, another moment with huge importance.",
      "United weren't done there, though, as Casemiro's glancing finish and a tap-in from Rasmus Hojlund - assisted by another sub, Amad - sealed the victort in style. And Mount wasn't finished even then, as he intercepted a clearance from Agirrezabala and finished from long range.",
      "Will Manchester United beat Tottenham in the Europa League final? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "An all-English affair will take place in Bilbao - coincidentally - on Wednesday, May 21. Tottenham had no concerns about a concerns about a comeback in Norway as they beat Bodo/Glimt 2-0 on the night to seal a 5-1 aggregate win.",
      "United have already lost three times to Spurs this season, so they'll need to come up with something different to beat Ange Postecoglou's team. It should be a tasty full English."

      "Manchester United and Tottenham have both secured their place in the Europa League final. The Premier League giants have both endured miserable domestic seasons, finding themselves in the bottom half of the table.",
      "That has piled the pressure on bosses Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou, but the two could both salvage their season with a European triumph. United are looking to win their first trophy under Amorim, while Spurs are looking to end their 17-year silverware drought.",
      "And along with lifting the trophy, winning the Europa League would also secure either side a passage to next season’s Champions League. Much to Arsene Wenger's annoyance.",
      "And the Premier League pair have each sealed their the final later this month. United beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 at Old Trafford to follow up last week's 3-0 win away from home, while Spurs saw off Bodo/Glimt 2-0 in Norway, sealing a 5-1 aggregate triumph.",
      "Here’s everything you need to know about the clash in Bilbao.",
      "It’s a relatively quick turnaround from the conclusion of the semi-final ties, with the final being played on Wednesday, May 21 at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mames Stadium. It will get underway at 8pm UK time.",
      "As is often the case with the UEFA competitions, the number of tickets on offer, compared to the amount going to supporters is a bone of contention. Bilbao’s stadium, built in 2013, holds more than 53,000 fans.",
      "But that hasn’t translated into large allocations for teams that reach the final. In fact, just over 29,000 tickets will go to fans of the finalists, with the remaining 24,000 allocated elsewhere.",
      "Unsurprisingly, that has angered both sets of supporters still in the competition, who will face a mad scramble to secure their place.",
      "Both Spurs and United have already opened applications to purchase tickets, due to the very small window between now and the final kicking off.",
      "Rather than the clubs themselves, UEFA will handle the ticket purchasing and distribution. Prices range from €40 (£34) for Category 4 tickets, all the way to Category 1 tickets which ill cost €240 (£204). There is an option for restricted view tickets at the top category level, which will set you back €190 (£161)."

      "Despite holding a 3-0 aggregate lead, Manchester United are not guaranteed a spot in the Europa League final on Thursday. That's according to Old Trafford legend Gary Pallister, who warned his old club the semi-final clash with Athletic Bilbao could still take an unexpected turn.",
      "The Red Devils capitalised on an early red card given to Athletic's Dani Vivian during last week's first leg at San Mames. Bruno Fernandes led the team to victory with two goals in the first half, but this still might not be enough to secure their advancement.",
      "Lyon managed to score four goals at the Theatre of Dreams in the last round, after all, even though two of those goals were scored in extra time with the French visitors down to 10 men. Old Trafford has lost its reputation as an impenetrable fortress, however, with both Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth snatching 3-0 wins there in the Premier League this season.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui nearly extended United's lead to four goals in Bilbao, but his shot hit the crossbar just before half-time. The match might have been out of reach for Athletic if that attempt had gone in, but Pallister explained even a three-goal lead isn't enough to guarantee victory for the current United squad.",
      "United's chances of keeping a clean sheet against the visiting team are looking better after reports surfaced that brothers Nico and Inaki Williams won't be featuring in the second leg due to injuries. Adding to that, Ernesto Valverde's leading goal scorer, Oihan Sancet, is also out of action for the Manchester matchup.",
      "On the other hand, United manager Ruben Amorim faces his own selection headache with defensive concerns, particularly after Matthijs de Ligt was injured in Sunday's 4-3 loss to Brentford. He will join Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot on the sidelines, while youngster Ayden Heaven might not recover in time for the game.",
      "United icon Pallister - who pipped Barcelona to the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, as well as winning four Premier League titles and three FA Cups - suggests United should adopt a more patient strategy in the second salvo against Athletic. He specifically notes that certain defensive positions could be key in curtailing Athletic's advances.",
      "\"I think you've got to be rock tight at the back. Your guys in front of that back four, back five. We don't want to be advancing whoever's playing wing-backs,\" he said. \"We want to sit in there and make sure we frustrate them. Let them know that it's not going to be easy to score against us, because that's them being desperate.",
      "\"I think they've got to try and score early and make Old Trafford nervous, which is what Lyon did eventually. Expect a lot more from [Athletic] in this return leg. But yeah, if we can be solid.",
      "\"I'd surely be telling the wing-backs let's not go flying forward. They probably did in the early part of the game in Bilbao, which surprised me a little bit. They tried to play on the front foot from the start, but as I say, they got forced back by Athletic, because we kept giving the ball away.\"",
      "The Europa League represents United's final shot at silverware this season, and clinching the trophy is their only route back to Europe next term. Whomever triumphs in their semi-final will go head-to-head with either Bodo/Glimt or Tottenham, with Spurs having a 3-1 lead prior to their second-leg clash in Norway on Thursday."

      "Marcus Rashford is said to have partnered with super-agent Pini Zahavi as well as indicating a willingness to lower his salary demands in order to help facilitate a move to Barcelona.",
      "The England star, 27, is expected to leave Manchester United permanently this summer and the Nou Camp is his dream destination. Crucially, Rashford has managed to boost his stock during the second half of the season after joining Aston Villa on loan but interest in his services from Barca is longstanding.",
      "While Rashford ending up staying in the Premier League, there have been numerous reports outlining his desire to join the Spanish giants should he leave Old Trafford for good.",
      "And a new report from Mundo Deportivo has claimed that Rashford is now being represented by Zahavi; an agent with close ties to Barcelona who also represents their manager, Hansi Flick, and Robert Lewandowski.",
      "It's claimed that the main reason for the move on Rashford's end is due to the fact that Zahavi has strong links to Barca, who do have a void to fill in the left-hand side of their front three with Ansu Fati failing to make an impression on Flick.",
      "Zahavi is believed to have a strong relationship with the club's president, Joan Laporta, and it's claimed that talks over a loan move this summer have already taken place.",
      "The news will come as a blow to Aston Villa, who negotiated a £40million option to purchase Rashford permanently as part of the deal that saw him move to Villa Park in the winter transfer window.",
      "He has four goals and six assists to his name in a Villa shirt but is expected to miss the remainder of the season through injury.",
      "United's preference would be to sell their homegrown star, who was dropped by Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese coach is aiming to reshape his playing squad this summer and any transfer fees that can be raised from offloading unwanted stars - such as Rashford and Antony, who has also enjoyed a renaissance away from Old Trafford - would be welcomed by the club.",

      "Paul Parker claims that the \"last thing\" Marcus Rashford would want this summer is a return to Manchester United, as he feels the England forward hasn't shown \"much difference\" in his performances at Aston Villa. Rashford joined the Villains on loan in January, after United head coach Ruben Amorim failed to see eye-to-eye with him.",
      "Following his loan move, Amorim was frank about his decision to let Rashford explore a new challenge, saying: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it.",
      "\"Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different. I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",
      "Since then, Rashford has made 17 appearances for Villa, scoring four goals and assisting six times. His most notable performances came in the Champions League, where he assisted once in the quarter-finals against Paris Saint-Germain to win the home leg 3-2 - but the team lost 5-4 on aggregate to the current finalists.",
      "While many people have been impressed with Rashford's form at his new club, one person who isn't too pleased is ex-United defender Parker, who has claimed the striker hasn't done enough to gain respect in the transfer market.",
      "Parker told BestBettingSites.com that the 27-year-old could have scraped up enough stability to push for a move away from United this summer. This is despite the fact that the former defender feels a transfer is the best plan for Rashford, who wouldn't want to return to Old Trafford.",
      "The two-time Premier League winner said: \"I think someone might come in and decide who wants to buy him, someone might take him on loan. I don't think he can do it for Manchester United, because from what I saw, when I watched him at Villa, and there wasn't much difference there, to be honest.\"",
      "Parker also lamented Unai Emery's decision to play Rashford ahead of other Villa stars, as he said: \"I have to say, if you're someone like Jacob Ramsey, you'd be a little bit disappointed. He played in front of you. If you were Watkins as well, you'd be gutted that you were left off the PSG games for him to play in your role.",
      "\"Did he do enough to shake enough trees for people to say, we want him? I personally don't think so. But PR-wise it was very good for him because he was being sold well on PR about how he'd done, but everything was always little points.\"",
      "Crucially, he added: \"So on that side of it people were trying to make the best of it, really. So I don't know how he's feeling, but I think the last thing he would want to be doing was coming back to Manchester United. And if Villa don't sign him, I've got no idea who would be interested.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Parker has slammed Rashford's character on and off the pitch, however; he previously told MyBettingSites in January this year that he was \"fed up\" with the footballer.",
      "Parker even went on to claim that the forward had been \"s******* on his own doorstep\" and disrespecting United that many times, that the hierarchy of the club will have lost far too much trust in him.",
      "The former Old Trafford star said: \"I’m fed up with Rashford to be honest. I was shocked. You have to be shocked, really. On the other hand you shouldn’t be shocked because that’s just what he does. He is a local boy and everyone is expecting him to behave better. He is just carrying on what he has done for a lot of years.",
      "\"He was given an incredible contract and now he is just enjoying his life. He was at a good level during the pandemic but he has ruined everything now. People were still backing him but the majority are just fed up with him now.\"",
      "Parker added: \"You live and die by the people you play with, and he has to remember that. I think it might end up with Rashford having to find a new club, and the teammates will have a hard time trusting him. Are they going to trust him? No, because he has been s******* on his own doorstep so many times.",
      "\"He needs to think about the fact that he is Manchester through and through. He will live in this city after he retires and he has to live with all these stories about his professionalism. It’s not going to be an enjoyable time for him to be honest.\"",
      "While United are struggling in the Premier League right now, sitting in 15th place with three games to go, they do have the second leg of a Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao to contend with on Thursday, holding a 3-0 lead going into the game.",
      "It is unclear whether Rashford – who has been linked with Barcelona of late – will return to his boyhood club in the summer to work under Amorim or head to pastures anew for the first time in his 10-year career. Whatever is decided, Parker believes there is no way back for the forward at the club who gave him his start in the sport."

      "Beckham also added, in an interview with The Athletic: “I will be over every big decision that’s made and every little decision that’s made. That’s what my commitment is to Gary. It’s what my commitment is to the club.”",
      "Salford are keen to reach the Championship as soon as possible under their new ownership group and emulate Wrexham's rise through the leagues. But Beckham is targeting the Premier League.",
      "“We’re definitely not doing it for a laugh and it’s also not for the romantic side of things. Yes, we care about the club — but we’re doing it to win. We want Salford to be successful and we have had success, but then we want it to go on to the next level.",
      "“I always dream big so I’m always going to want us to get to the pinnacle of football and be in the Premier League. But there’s a lot of hard work and a lot of investment to be done up until that point.",
      "“The Championship is a league that we want to get in but it’s step by step. We want success very quickly but these things take time. There’s a reason why we’re not going to be going up this year. So what is that reason? How do we solve it? And what do we need to put around the team, the manager and the club to ensure we have that success?",
      "“But if we can do that, fast forward it and be up in the Championship, that’s what the dream would be.",
      "“We’ve all been inspired by what Ryan Reynolds has been doing at Wrexham and I’m not saying this is why we’re doing it because it’s not. But I’ve spoken to Ryan about it so many times now and he said the feeling around the city, the feeling around the club, is so exceptional. That’s the kind of thing that we want to create.",
      "“Tom Wagner and Tom Brady have done an incredible job with Birmingham. I went to a game a few months back and the atmosphere in the stadium was one of the best I’ve seen for a long time. That’s what we want to create. We want to create that community, add to the community and fan base we’ve already got — and then lift it.",
      "“When you see what the Toms are doing, there is investment, there is a plan and it would be the dream to talk about the growth of Salford City.",
      "“It’s not only growth on the field, which is what we care most about, but we want success. Because if we’re having success then we’re also having the opportunity to say: ‘Now we we’re going to invest, now we’re going to get a bigger stadium, now we’re going to get a bigger training facility and then it will go on. That is what we’re aiming for.",
      "Neville added: “I feel very strongly that owners are just guardians of football clubs for fans and the idea is that fans should have access behind the scenes to what people are doing in the club. It’s almost like a public company and it should be treated as such because of its importance to the community.",
      "“We’ve never been shy in coming forward in respect of content for the club and that will be the same moving forward. But there are different innovative ways that can be done that isn’t just a straight documentary.\"",
      "He added: “We have to be successful on the pitch, we have to invest in the local area and we also need to look at our infrastructure; the stadium and training ground. We’ve invested heavily over the last 10 years and we’ll invest heavily again in this next four or five years — but we need to get this club on a firm footing financially and get balance into this club.",
      "“There are very good examples of clubs in League Two, League One and the Championship who are almost sustainable, with a little bit of owner funding. They have created a player trading model and financial and commercial revenue streams that mean that they can look at things slightly differently and be successful, whilst being more sustainable.”",
      "Declan Kelly and Mervyn Davies said in a joint statement: “We have been close friends and partners for more than a decade and we look forward to partnering with David, Gary, this phenomenal new ownership group, the Class of ’92 and everyone at SCFC to take this project to the next level and hopefully bring more success to Salford City’s wonderful fan base, players and everyone associated with the club.”",
      "Salford finished eighth in League Two this season, just outside of the players. They have been in the fourth tier of English football for the past six seasons and flirted with a return to the National League last term."

      "David Beckham’s desire to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid was solidified after the club tried to flog him to Barcelona. Beckham became a Galactico in 2003 when he swapped Old Trafford for the Bernabeu – but the transfer only came to fruition after Barca got involved in a tug of war.",
      "The England star came through the United academy and played for the club for 11 years before deciding to move elsewhere. A falling out with manager Sir Alex Ferguson played a role in the decision, with Fergie writing in his 2013 autobiography: “David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game.”",
      "He added: “The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager he had to go... David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. There is no doubt about that in my mind.”",
      "Real Madrid ended up paying €35million (£25m) to United for Beckham and the right midfielder joined on a four-year contract which was reportedly worth €6m per year. But had United chairman Peter Kenyon got his way, Beckham would have actually joined Barcelona instead.",
      "\"My team was always Real Madrid and funnily enough I got sold from Manchester United to Barcelona,\" he told CBS Sports. \"I was on holiday, Peter Kenyon phoned me and he said: 'We've accepted a bid from Barcelona and we're selling you'.",
      "\"I said: 'If you are going to sell me, the only team I want to move to is Real Madrid', because I always had a dream of playing for Real Madrid when I was a young kid.",
      "\"I never thought I'd leave Manchester United but if I did, you know, I'd love to have played for Real Madrid. And if they wanted me to leave then the only club that I wanted to go to was Real Madrid.\" Beckham added: \"Funnily enough, in a day and a half, it happened.”",
      "In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4, Beckham admitted that United’s desire to sell him to a club he didn’t want to join helped clarify his thoughts about joining a star-studded Real. “There was never any revenge. I was hurt and angry at the time at how the situation had gone because throughout the season I was left out of certain games but never thought it would lead to me leaving,” he said.",
      "\"I then flew back to London. I tried to speak to Peter Kenyon and tried to speak to the manager and he said 'no'. I said 'well I need to speak to him and understand what is going on'. He said 'it's true, we have agreed a deal'.",
      "\"That is when I spoke to my agent and said 'if I am going to move, I'm going to move to Madrid'. Within a day, I was sat with the president of Madrid and we agreed that is where I was going to go.”"

      "Three years ago last week, Alejandro Garnacho's family were moved to tears in the directors' box at Old Trafford as, donning the No.47 shirt, he stepped onto the pitch for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea.",
      "At just 17 years old, Ralf Rangnick had spotted Garnacho's potential, which had been instrumental in leading United's academy to the FA Youth Cup final. Following his first-team debut, Garnacho returned to Old Trafford two weeks later and sealed the victory against Nottingham Forest with a brace.",
      "Since than, United have kept Garnacho from extensive media exposure. But on Wednesday, for the first time since his arrival in Manchester four-and-a-half years ago, Garnacho made his first Carrington press appearance.",
      "It came at a time where his long-term future is somewhat uncertain. In January, Napoli saw a £40million bid rejected while Chelsea have shown interest too. Both could launch summer moves. But Garnacho - a product of Atletico Madrid's and United's development as a winger - is now adapting to life under a coach devoted to a 3-4-2-1 formation. He's started 13 matches on the trot and is set to make it 14 against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night.",
      "He conceded that the initial transition under Ruben Amorim had been \"difficult\". And he joined Marcus Rashford in being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby back in mid-December due to issues with their attitude. Since then, Rashford hasn't played for United and might never again.",
      "But Garnacho has knuckled down and is firmly back en vogue. United are closing in on a deal for Matheus Cunha which looks near enough done, sparking talk that Garnacho's place as a starter could be under threat as the club seeks a new No. 10 and a specialist.",
      "Yet this is the winger who surged past Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Martial, and Anthony Elanga in the fight for the left-wing spot. Garnacho has outlasted them all. Former teammates from Jose Mourinho's days at the helm have taken note of Rashford's inability to take criticism well. Meanwhile, Garnacho showcased self-reflection during his discussion at Carrington.",
      "Garnacho admitted: \"I think it's difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation. But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "\"It's a little bit hard but it's just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.\"",
      "In preparation for the quarter-final second leg against Lyon, United opted for Harry Maguire to partner Amorim as they sought a \"leader\" for the press address. According to club insiders, Garnacho took the initiative himself to step up here, realising he hadn't previously faced pre-match media responsibilities and he fancied taking the lead.",
      "He wanted to convey his happiness at the club: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.\"",
      "Having played 140 times for United, Garnacho joining Amorim at the media forefront signalled his ascending maturity and experience.",
      "Despite having emulated Cristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations, Garnacho modestly sidestepped direct comparisons with the legendary winger. He is just a single goal shy of equalling the 27 goals Ronaldo netted in his initial three years with United. Ronaldo was 21 years old in his third season with the club back in 2005-06, and Garnacho is set to celebrate his own 21st birthday this July.",
      "When it comes to statistics, Garnacho downplays their significance. \"I'm not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.\"",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "Four members of Garnacho's family were spotted in the United executives' section in Bilbao last week, proudly wearing 'Garnacho 17' on their shirts. If he remains, it may not be long until he's upgraded to the club's much-vaunted No.7."

      "Remained on the wing but found it tougher going than in Bilbao and got booked, which possibly influenced the decision to substitute him. 5",

      "His weakest performance in the knockout stage. Struggled to match Athletic's intensity and committed a cynical foul on Alvaro Djalo. But still got the winning goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Started identically to last week, constantly picking out an Athletic shirt, and he did not improve after half-time. So poor he was hooked. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Got into some auspicious positions but his decision-making was often terrible. Switched to the right wing when changes were made. 5",

      "A Union Jack was unfurled in the Stretford End on VE Day. Manchester United are now one victory away from salvaging their season.",
      "Those flags were ubiquitous in Rotterdam for United's second European final in 1991. It was dusted off at an opportune time. United have a ninth European final back in Bilbao.",
      "With United 1-0 down, the Stretford End still broke into a rendition of 'Cause United are going to Bilbao'. They will. The 7-1 aggregate scoreline does Athletic Bilbao a disservice but that is United in Europe this season.",
      "The majority of this performance was more in keeping with United's domestic form than their European pedigree. For most of the night, United lived up to their manager's billing as the worst in living memory.",
      "And still United summoned the gumption to not just avoid defeat but win emphatically. They put four goals past Athletic, aided by three substitutions.",
      "Amad, somehow not starting, was scintillating following his game-changing introduction. Mason Mount sparked the comeback with a first Old Trafford goal and he rounded off the scoring with a strike so supreme that Ruben Amorim finally broke into a smile. The stars in Europe seem to be aligning for United.",
      "In the Europa League, at least, United are just like watching Seville. Their love affair with the Europa League is similar to the seven-time winners who thwarted them in the 2020 semi-finals.",
      "Yet United are 14 unbeaten in the Europa League and still the only undefeated team in Europe. It is 19 goals in six knockout ties. For the second successive round, they tallied seven goals across both legs. In the Premier League, their goal difference is a pitiful -9.",
      "They have also lifted their Spanish hex in knockout competitions. The sequence of eliminations to La Liga opponents has ended at six.",
      "\"Don't go out tonight, unless you're red and white,\" is the refrain from the Stretford End. There was red and white en masse but from the Basque Country.",
      "Athletic brought San Mames to the Old Trafford away end. Their stadium was billed as 'the cathedral of football' last week and on the day a plume of white smoke emanated from the Vatican, they sensed a miracle. They petered out after a game 72 minutes.",
      "Amid the rallying cries from the United followers, there were worried murmurs throughout the evening. United fans fretted over every loss of possession while the Athletic analysts in the press box constantly slumped in their seats at missed opportunities.",
      "The second half started so badly that Amorim was concerned enough to make three substitutions before the hour. That was in responde to United ceding the ball again. Athletic were without their top scorer, Oihan Sancet, again and the Williams brothers Nico and Inaki. The Williams sisters could cause this United side strife.",
      "Those proactive changes ended the threat of an Athletic recovery. Mount's first Old Trafford goal was reminiscent of Federico Macheda's swivel-and-shot at the Stretford End against Aston Villa 15 years earlier. It elicited nearly as loud a roar. That was checkmate.",
      "Mount's second, around 40 yards from goal with the net vacated by goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala, trumped his first. Nearly two years on from Mount's unveiling, the number seven shirt did not weigh as heavily as United racked up seven goals.",
      "Amorim will still be troubled by the first hour. He has to shoulder much of the responsibility for overloading the team with defensive players. That pragmatism in Bilbao was understandable as he played the percentages. In a home return leg, it sent out the wrong message.",
      "That was compounded by the wrong selection: Victor Lindelof. Amad has not started a game in three months but almost certainly will against West Ham on Sunday. Three days is not going to make a great deal of difference.",
      "Amad has to start not just at the weekend but against Chelsea next Friday to build him up for the final. Having been used on the wing at Brentford, he was one of the two playmakers against Athletic and that proximity to the goal was decisive.",
      "That throws up the dilemma of what to do with Alejandro Garnacho, a dogged deputy but not as reliable. His frivolous finish when one-on-one in the first half evoked memories of his impotence in such situations two years ago.",
      "Lindelof played United into trouble twice in the opening stages and his sloppiness became infectious. Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Harry Maguire, all decisive in Bilbao, regressed. Ugarte was such a liability he was removed in the first batch of substitutions in the 62nd minute.",
      "Casemiro, typically, rallied. It was fitting that a player who has reserved his standout form for the knockout stage nodded in the winning goal. Casemiro patted the United crest and was serenaded louder than ever at Old Trafford. He can be assured of another European final start after starting in four for Real Madrid.",
      "If United are often unrecognisable on European nights then their manager isn't. Amorim was furious with some early errors and quickly on his haunches, a signal he is anxious.",
      "Minutes into the second half, Amorim had to advise Andre Onana to float his goal kicks into the Athletic half. Providing pointers for a 29-year-old who is visibly prepared to assume responsibility in matches reflected terribly on the team's game management.",
      "In the stands, the night had some of the ambience and effort of Barcelona 2008. There was another tifo, more pyrotechnics and some fireworks, once more defying any lingering notion that United treat the Premier League and the Europa League equally. 'Take Me Home' will not be belted out with such fervent gusto before kick-off against West Ham.",
      "But it will be in Bilbao."

The 26-year-old rounded off the scoring in the 7-1 aggregate triumph with a perfectly-clipped lob from 40 yards with goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala outside the area.",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he \"loves\" Mount, who made his first start in nearly five months in the 4-3 defeat at Brentford on Sunday. The attacking midfielder has now scored three goals in two games and is competing for a place in United's Europa League final XI as one of the two playmakers in the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "\"Not just me,\" Amorim said when asked about his happy reaction to Mount's performance. \"If you look at the bench, that is the best feeling for a coach. When you look at the other guys on the bench are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount do everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He’s a really good player and both goals are really good goals, so I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, the teammates were so happy for him.",
      "\"Was a good result. I think if you look at both games was so much tougher than if you just look to the result. We have so many weaknesses, you can understand that but we are fighting and we deserve if you look at two games, to be in the final.",
      "\"The money is not the most important, even the title to win as a coach, is that feeling that we can do good things, the feeling to give something to our fans, particularly in this season. It’s not just playing Champions League next season it’s that feeling that we can change things\"",
      "United's opponents in the Europa League final, Tottenham, are unbeaten against United under coach Ange Postecoglou. Since Postecoglou was appointed in the summer of 2023, Spurs have beaten United four times and drawn once.",
      "The final in Bilbao is widely expected to be Postecoglou's last match in charge of Tottenham, who are below 15th-placed United in the Premier League. Amorim admitted he and Postecoglou are \"struggling\" and reiterated he has no idea which United will turn up in the final on May 21.",
      "\"Every game has its history,\" Amorim added. \"We lost the three last games (against Tottenham), we can win this one.",
      "\"So if you look at the loss, we are closer to win than to lose. Both teams are going play all or nothing, the position of the coach is quite similar.",
      "\"I know Ange has one more year, it is different, the context, but we are struggling both of us! I don’t know what is going to happen, it’s a good thing and a bad thing with this team, I never know!",
      "\"So I will try to prepare the game. But I think we are improving if we had more solutions. We can take (Alejandro) Garnacho with the speed, transition, for Amad and to have that possibility can win games. Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, all these players, we can choose from these players and to prepare the final in a better way.",

      "Mason Mount delivered an outstanding performance after being introduced from the bench, scoring the equaliser and the fourth goal of the game with a tremendous strike from the halfway line.",
      "Casemiro scored a header and Rasmus Hojlund scored to join the fun at Old Trafford. Casemiro also netted a header in the first leg and the Brazilian has enjoyed a superb renaissance this term.",
      "United will play Tottenham at the Estadio de San Mamés on May 21.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "A Union Jack was unfurled in the Stretford End on VE Day. Manchester United are now one victory away from salvaging their season.",
      "Those flags were ubiquitous in Rotterdam for United's second European final in 1991. It was dusted off at an opportune time. United have a ninth European final back in Bilbao.",
      "With United 1-0 down, the Stretford End still broke into a rendition of 'Cause United are going to Bilbao'. They will. The 7-1 aggregate scoreline does Athletic Bilbao a disservice but that is United in Europe this season.",
      "The majority of this performance was more in keeping with United's domestic form than their European pedigree. For most of the night, United lived up to their manager's billing as the worst in living memory.",
      "And still United summoned the gumption to not just avoid defeat but win emphatically. They put four goals past Athletic, aided by three substitutions.",
      "Amad, somehow not starting, was scintillating following his game-changing introduction. Mason Mount sparked the comeback with a first Old Trafford goal and he rounded off the scoring with a strike so supreme that Ruben Amorim finally broke into a smile. The stars in Europe seem to be aligning for United.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Andre Onana",
      "Got a hand to Jauregizar's fine curling effort but it would be harsh to label it a goalkeeping error. Had little else to do, despite Athletic's dominance. 5",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "An incongruous starter even after lining up last week and played United into trouble twice early on. Another nervy performance. 5",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "His sloppy pass led to Athletic's goal and, like the rest of the United defence, will be relieved the Williams brothers were back in Bilbao. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Earned a couple of rounds of applause from Ruben Amorim in the first half. Coolest of the back three and went on the front foot to assist Mount. 7",
      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "UNITED ARE IN THE EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL!",
      "Mount scores from the halfway line to wrap it up - outstanding from the midfielder.",
      "The only undefeated team in Europe are off to Bilbao. It's a genuinely remarkable achievement to make the Europa League final during such a miserable season. It’s been ‘Bilbao or bust’ for a few months and United are now just 90 minutes away from glory, so pack your bags.",
      "Hojlund joins in on the fun after a lovely run forward from Yoro, who finds Dorgu.",
      "Dorgu then finds Amad, who assists Hojlund with a great cross.",
      "Old Trafford is absolutely bouncing because United are off to Bilbao again.",
      "Mainoo and Amass ON.",
      "Casemiro and Lindelof OFF.",
      "Casemiro scores a header from a free-kick to wrap up the tie for United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Brazilian scores his second header of the tie and really enjoyed that.",
      "What a moment that was for Mount, who’s had some bad luck with a few muscle injuries in the last two seasons. That feels like the goal that could finally ignite his time at United.",
      "We have lift off at Old Trafford and just look at that smile on Mount's face.",
      "What a brilliant turn and finish from the midfielder, just superb.",
      "We've reached the 70 minute mark and United still haven't had a shot on target tonight.",
      "It's only going to take one goal from the Spaniards to increase the nerves tenfold in Old Trafford.",
      "United are forunate because that header curled inches away from the post.",
      "Amad, Mount and Shaw ON.",
      "Garnacho, Mazraoui and Ugarte and OFF.",
      "You can feel the belief growing within these Athletic players and in that away end. They are building up an impressive head of steam and must be able to sense that United are wobbling in a big way. Another goal for the visitors is going to make the tension unbearable and at the moment it feels far more likely than United getting a goal.",
      "United are beginning to look nervous because Bilbao are placing them under immense pressure.",
      "Bilbao are controlling this game and breaking the lines with their passing. Amorim will be thinking about making a change and maybe that needs to happen sooner rather than later.",
      "The away side have started this second half as the better team again, which is ominous.",
      "Mainoo, Shaw, Mount and Amad have been sent to warm up at the start of the second half.",
      "We're back under way for the second half at Old Trafford.",
      "And here are your half-time ratings...",
      "Onana",
      "Could have kept the goal out. 5",
      "Lindelof",
      "Nervy again. 4",
      "Maguire",
      "Sloppy pass for the goal. 5",
      "Yoro",
      "Coolest of the back three. 6",
      "Mazraoui",
      "Booked early on. 6",
      "Ugarte",
      "Not used the ball well. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "His poorest performance in the knockouts so far. 5",
      "Dorgu",
      "Wasteful too often. 5",
      "Fernandes",
      "Poor. 5",
      "Garnacho",
      "Bad finish. 5",
      "Hojlund",
      "Led the line decently. 6",
      "That's the half-time whistle here.",
      "Bilbao have the lead at the interval.",
      "That miss from Garnacho is reminiscent of some of his one-on-ones at that end in his first season. That’s what gets held against him: he hasn’t matured in those situations two years on. That attempt was frivolous at a critical moment in the match and tie.",
      "Garnacho has just missed another huge chance when he really should have buried that.",
      "This half hasn't gone as supporters hoped, but United are still in control of the tie.",
      "Athletic have brought the San Mames to Old Trafford with their away end. They billed their stadium as ‘the cathedral of football’ last week and on the day the white smoke has emerged from the Vatican they must be feeling hopeful of a miracle.",
      "The game has become even more such Athletic scored, which is just as well for United. Athletic are starting to force some things now they have got a goal and that does play into United’s hands a bit.",
      "Even that United attack felt nervy. Ugarte didn’t put enough on the pass to Garnacho, his ball back seemed more hopeful than aimed at someone and Dorgu steamed in ahead of Fernandes when it might have been better to leave it for the captain. It’s getting edgy all of a sudden.",
      "You can hear the worried murmurs around the ground. Both teams might be content with 1-0 at half-time. United need to regroup and reassess their team. Athletic would still have three quarters of an hour to get two goals. United are completely dependent on counter attacks.",
      "Fernandes is using the stoppage to offer Dorgu a pointer. Probably, ‘leave the ball for me’.",
      "United drive forward on the counter-attack with pace and Dorgu has a shot, but it's blocked."

      "United are still managing the fitness of Amad, who was influential in turning around their Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao. Amad has made three substitute appearances since he recovered from an ankle injury but last started on February 7.",
      "Dalot has been sidelined for two weeks while De Ligt was forced off in the 4-3 loss at Brentford on Sunday in what was his first start in more than a month.",

      "\"It’s going to be hard,\" Amorim acknowledged. \"Players like Mason Mount we have to be careful, Amad is still getting momentum, some players are not capable to do that.",
      "\"We rest Nous, but you can feel Mazraoui doesn’t have energy in this moment. We try to help in that department. Dalot is doing everything to recover and I think they will push now to be available.",
      "\"Some players cannot play 90 minutes and we have to protect them not to get injuries for the final.\"",

      "Amad assisted Rasmus Hojlund's goal to make it 3-1 before Mount scored a classy 40-yarder with the goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala outside the area.",

      "As Leny Yoro danced past a challenge and teed up Mason Mount for the goal that settled Manchester United nerves at Old Trafford, there were shades of Rio Ferdinand in his play.",
      "Yoro is growing in confidence as a United player after his £52million summer move from Lille. In recent weeks, his quality on the ball has become more noticeable, not just in terms of his passing but also his marauding forward runs from a position in the back three.",
      "That Yoro is occasionally beginning to resemble Ferdinand - a graceful centre-back who made 455 appearances for the club - is perhaps no surprise, given that the latter has become something of a mentor to the 19-year-old, who has played just 30 games for United.",
      "The teenager takes advice from his manager but is close to Ferdinand. The 46-year-old spoke to the Frenchman when he was close to joining United, and they have remained in touch, speaking not only on camera for an interview but also off-screen as Yoro tries to develop his game.",
      "\"I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio and not always in front of the cameras,\" said Yoro. \"Sometimes they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, you need to take it. I try to do my best and what they tell me to do.\"",
      "Social media was awash with comparisons between Yoro and Ferdinand after his starring role in the 4-1 win against Athletic Bilbao, a result that booked United a spot in the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "He is also starting to be compared to some other outstanding defenders in United's recent past, and he has undoubtedly been a bright spot in what has been a difficult campaign for the club.",
      "\"Of course, I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies, so when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, Vidic, Varane you want to achieve the same things as them, stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender,\" he said.",
      "\"When they compare me to them, it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this. I’m trying to be the best I can.",
      "\"When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this [history] - this is a club of trophies. I think it will be important to think about this, we’re Manchester United and need to win trophies.",
      "\"I’m still a young player, but on the pitch, this means nothing. When you join a big club like Man United you have to settle quickly because the fans are waiting for you, even with a big transfer like I had. So yeah, it was important to settle really quickly.\"",
      "Yoro's start to life at Old Trafford was halted by a metatarsal injury he suffered in just his second pre-season game. He didn't start a game until December but is now becoming a regular presence in the back three.",
      "\"It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned,\" he said. \"But now I’m 100 per cent, I start to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season.\""

      "Manchester United are in the Europa League final after they beat Athletic Club 4-1 at Old Trafford in a semi-final second leg that was far tenser than the final scoreline suggests.",
      "Leading 3-0 after last week's success in Spain, United were on the ropes for a while after Mikel Jauregizar scored in the first half. But Ruben Amorim's triple change on the hour mark altered the course of the game, with Amad influential.",
      "Mason Mount started and finished a spell of four goals in 18 minutes, scoring two outstanding efforts, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund also finding the net in front of the Stretford End.",
      "A result that flattered United means they will face Tottenham in the Europa League final back in Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "A game-changer",
      "Amad had been on the pitch barely a minute when he produced United's best moment of what had been a dreadful second half until then. Exchanging passes with Patrick Dorgu, he drove into the area and immediately had Athletic on the back foot.",
      "His introduction, along with that of Luke Shaw and Mount, added some life into a poor United performance. It was Amad that did most of all to bring energy and invention to a sub-par display that had been wracked with nerves.",
      "Every time he got possession he looked to run at the defence and he helped to swing the momentum of the game. Until that point a second Athletic goal had looked far more likely.",
      "It was his run and ability to beat his man that led to the goal. He skinned Yuri Berchiche and although his cross was too high for Mount, the ball was kept alive and the goal came seconds later. He created United's third with a low pass for Hojlund to tap in and as they celebrated Hojlund pointed to Amad in front of the Stretford End. He has to start the final.",
      "Mount's smile",
      "Mount looked calm and composed after scoring a brilliant goal to settle this tie, but as he walked back from the Stretford End a smile as wide as United's 4-1 lead spread across his face and he couldn't resist punching the air.",
      "This was his third United goal but his first at Old Trafford. It was one he will never forget. There were obvious comparisons with Federico Macheda's goal against Aston Villa in 2008/09.",
      "It was a special moment and one richly deserved for a player who has already been through a lot at this club. There remains a feeling that he can really contribute to United, especially under Amorim, and this has been his best week since a £60million move from Chelsea.",
      "A familiar failing",
      "Amorim slapped his arms down to his side when Manuel Ugarte's poor pass out to Dorgu was intercepted by Andoni Gorosabel in the 20th minute at Old Trafford. It summed up a familiar failing for this team.",
      "The head coach has been repeating himself in recent weeks when asking for his team to start games better, but the message isn't getting through. He warned them of the storm likely to hit them in Bilbao but they were sluggish starters and lucky to be level after 20 minutes.",
      "Pre-match at Old Trafford, Amorim again said he hoped his team would deal with the start better. They didn't. Victor Lindelof was sloppy in possession, Ugarte gave the ball away a couple of times and Hojlund let one ball run out of play when he should have kept it in.",
      "United cannot keep making so many sloppy, simple mistakes in the early moments of games and expect to get away with it.",
      "Onana's kicking",
      "Andre Onana dealt well with two passes to him on his right foot in the opening exchanges at Old Trafford, then had a more routine clearance on his left foot and skied it into the air, barely clearing his own penalty area.",
      "Amorim shrugged his shoulders in disappointment at seeing the kick fail to ease the pressure on the United defence and it was another one of those moments that gives a voice to the idea that doubts persist over Onana's ability to maintain his place as the club's No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Onana blazed a free-kick straight out of play early in the second half, firing it in low, flat and hard and giving nobody a chance to get on the end of it. Amorim bellowed 'Andre' to get his attention and made a looping signal with his hand, telling him to float the free-kick in next time. This sort of stuff really shouldn't need explaining.",
      "His distribution was his super-strength at Inter and Ajax, but it's been inconsistent at United and isn't as much of an issue behind a back three anyway. He has steadied the ship after his Lyon nightmare, but the doubts won't go away.",
      "Turning the volume down",
      "With around 15 minutes until kick-off at Old Trafford, PA Alan Keegan turned the volume down so that the United fans could turn the volume up. The final song played before the music was cut was Bonnie Tyler's 'Heartache', which has been reworked by supporters as a song lauding Amorim.",
      "It is a ploy United have used occasionally in recent years and is an attempt to let the atmosphere speak for itself ahead of the biggest games. They don't come much bigger than a European semi-final second leg, even in the Europa League. The Stretford End responded and it was a crackling atmosphere pre-match, leading to the unveiling of another tifo in front of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand.",
      "Amorim had spoken ahead of kick-off about the support his team have had this season, referencing a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford as an example of how the fans stay with the team.",
      "“For me, it’s more special: they were incredible against Bournemouth at home, Nottingham Forest at home,\" he said. \"The way they support us when we lose 3-0 at home, when we have back-to-back losses at home. These kinds of moments, they show this is a special club. They are special. We want to give something to them. Again, we want to win this also, for them.”"

      "Don't cancel those hotel rooms. Don't sell those flights. Don't swap those Euros back. Manchester United are going back to Bilbao, but what should have been a comfortable night of celebration at Old Trafford turned into a fraught, tense affair. Ruben Amorim had said on Wednesday that they would have to suffer to reach a European final, but there's suffering, and then there's this.",
      "For a 15-minute spell at the start of the second half, it genuinely felt like it could all go wrong. If their 3-0 win in Bilbao last week was a pleasant surprise, this was a return to the norm. No wonder Amorim's first words after last week's win were a warning that this wasn't done yet. He already knows this team too well.",
      "On paper, this result and the aggregate score of 7-1 look like a walk in the park, and at times it was. But it also felt far, far closer than that. Three goals in 15 minutes in Bilbao and three goals in 13 minutes in Manchester made all the difference for United.",
      "They were ruthless in punishing Ernesto Valverde's side last week, and after a nervous beginning and had Athletic not been without Nico and Inaki Williams at Old Trafford, they might not have got away with what was a desperately poor performance until the final quarter of the game.",
      "All of that will be for another day, but you can be sure Amorim won't forget that spell when his team was toiling and supporters were fearing those early bookings for the final were going to be costly.",
      "On a day when white smoke billowed from the Vatican, it was red smoke drifting across the Old Trafford pitch just before kick-off after another pre-match pyrotechnic display.",
      "The swift election of a new pope ended the conclave and allowed the cardinals to emerge from their retreat and back into the world. Had United blown this, they would have needed a similar getaway where phones are locked away and the outside world shuttered off. The criticism would have been fierce.",
      "It was the unloseable semi-final - an Old Trafford formality against a side in a hopeless position and shorn of its best players. Valverde's starting line-up had 14 goals between them this season on a night when they needed to score at least three away from home.",
      "They didn't play like a team that felt the game was up, however, and United did play like a team that was fearing the worst. There was none of the confidence and control you would expect of a team in their position. So when Mikel Jauregizar scored his third goal in 52 games for the club, it didn't feel like a bolt from the blue.",
      "It did lead to increased anxiety levels within Old Trafford. You could hear the murmurs and sense the tension all of a sudden. When the Stretford End broke into a rendition of 'For United are going to Bilbao' early in the second half, it was sung with none of the gusto of an hour earlier. It might have felt like tempting fate now.",
      "It took Amorim until the hour mark to decide he had seen enough. The only saving grace of the early exchanges in the second half was that a timid, tepid and terrified United didn't concede again, but you could sense the belief growing within the Athletic players and in the away end.",
      "The introduction of Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Amad gradually gave United a foothold back in the game. Amad's energy and incision were transformative. Mount scored two brilliant goals in front of the Stretford End, Casemiro converted Bruno Fernandes' free-kick, Rasmus Hojlund scored from two yards and a party that had threatened to go flat was in full swing.",
      "But you can be sure Amorim will remember the moments United were on the ropes more than anything. He will have learnt a lot about his players when they were wobbling for the first hour of this game. Against a better side, they wouldn't have got away with it.",
      "The Portuguese has already shown his standards are high, and when emotions have settled, he will be poring over the first 65 minutes of this game rather than the final 25."

      "Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund were also on the scoresheet on the night to record 7-1 on aggregate. Meanwhile, Tottenham sealed a 2-0 victory (5-1 on aggregate) against Bodo/Glimt in Norway, courtesy of Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro.",
      "Spurs have reached a European final for the first time since the 2018/19 season, when they suffered a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool as Jugen Klopp's side lifted the Champions League trophy. After a challenging season for both Ruben Amorim and Postecoglou, each manager now has the opportunity to secure his first trophy with their respective club.",
      "However, Postecoglou has previously cautioned that he typically starts winning trophies in his second year at a club. After Spurs' 1-0 defeat to Arsenal last September, he remarked: \"I'll correct myself - I don't usually win things, I always win things in my second year.",
      "\"Nothing's changed. I've said it now. I don't say things unless I believe them.\"",
      "Speaking after the win over Bodo/Glimt in his press-conference, the Australian said: \"It's a great opportunity. It's my fourth year in European football, plenty of people have been in European football for longer than I have, they haven't got to a final.",
      "\"So you understand it's something that you need to appreciate and I'll certainly do that. I haven't really thought a lot about it, because obviously the focus is on tonight. More importantly, just really pleased for the players and the staff, and particularly our supporters.",
      "\"There were a few hundred here tonight who I'm sure will remember this night. And thousands back home. We've given them some real hope and something to dream about, that we can do something special this year. I couldn't care less who's struggling and who's not. I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there. I think we've probably beaten teams who will be in the Champions League next year, on our road to getting there. So looking forward to it, should be a great game.\"",
      "Postecoglou's comments that he usually wins silverware in his second season at a club come as a stark warning to Amorim and his players ahead of the final - and they will be hoping they can prevent the Australian from doing so in Bilbao on May 21.",

      "Ruben Amorim introduced Mount from the bench on the hour mark and the 26-year-old was responsible for the equaliser. Mount then scored a tremendous goal in added time to wrap up a comeback 4-1 victory, which ensured United will play Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month.",

      "Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund, and a second-half brace from Mason Mount sealed a 7-1 aggregate victory for United. It will be an all English final with Tottenham coming away 2-0 winners against Bodo/Glimt in Norway (5-1 on aggregate).",
      "The final will take place in Bilbao on May 21, as Ruben Amorim's side aim to claim their first piece of silverware since 2017, when they last won the Europa League under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Off the pitch, MEN Sport rounds up the latest headlines from Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "Matheus Cunha 'offer'",
      "United continue to work behind the scenes to secure an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha. The Athletic's David Ornstein claims that an offer has been made but an agreement is yet to be struck between parties.",
      "In addition, discussions are continuing to take place though not a great deal can happen before the season ends. With that said, it's thought the Reds will look to get personal terms in place in the meantime.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"It’s encouraging to see Manchester United making a strong push to secure a deal for the Brazilian, as it highlights their intent to improve their prospects for next season. The move reflects a proactive effort to address a key weakness - attacking depth and consistency - which has been a recurring issue this campaign. Cunha is expected to play a key role under Amorim.",
      "\"His Premier League experience adds further value, and at 25, he fits a growing trend in United’s transfer strategy: targeting younger, proven players with potential to develop, rather than relying on big-name signings that may not align with the team’s system.\"",
      "Liam Delap update",
      "There’s also been a positive development in United’s pursuit of a new striker after Liam Delap reportedly emerged as their top target. According to The Athletic, the necessary funds to land him are already in place, though the deal is expected to take some time to finalise.",
      "This delay is attributed to strong competition for Delap’s signature, as the player has yet to decide on his preferred destination.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"This is understandable. At just 22, Delap is at a crucial point in his career, where making the right move could have lasting implications for his development. Regular playing time and a system that suits his style are essential for his progression.",
      "\"A rushed decision that doesn’t align with his strengths or long-term ambitions could hinder his growth—particularly with the fierce competition for places at top clubs. Fortunately, Delap is in the advantageous position of attracting interest from multiple clubs, giving him the opportunity to carefully choose the best environment to thrive.\"",

      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",

      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nOut of favour at Arsenal, who are addicted to signing left-backs under Mikel Arteta, Zinchenko will leave this summer and knowing the Gunners, they’ll get £5m for him and he will go on to be world-class elsewhere.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nNewcastle tried and failed last summer. They should come back for him in June.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund), Jorrel Hato (Ajax), Mike Maignan (Milan) and Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nThe rest, I guess. The only surprise out of these four is AC Milan and France goalkeeper Maignan. He is club captain and his country’s long-term No. 1, but he is out of contract next year so the Italian giants could seek a fee this summer.",
      "Tah, meanwhile, is out of contract in 2025 and wanted by a host of clubs. The latest we have on Gittens is that Arsenal want him, and Hato is one of the most promising defenders in the world and wanted by every top club."

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure.",
      "Harry Maguire was the hero against Lyon while Rasmus Hojlund did sweet f-all once again. Here are ten reasons Amorim should start the centre-back up top for Man Utd."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "It’s claimed ‘sources close to the player indicate early-stage talks have already begun ahead of the summer window’, but in what will be a significant blow to Manchester United, ‘a loan deal is seen as the most realistic path’.",
      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",

Spurs lag behind the other five in that respect, but in the same vein every other club in the country – and most across Europe – cannot touch Spurs in terms of infrastructure.",

      "",
      "10) Borussia Dortmund\nThe established cliche used to be that Bayern would sign the best players from Dortmund, who in turn would shop in the smaller Bundesliga markets. But it doesn’t really apply anymore, with free agent Raphael Guerreiro the only player since 2016 to cross the divide and leave Germany’s second-biggest fish for the bona fide shark.",
      "Dortmund cannot even lay consistent claim to being the country’s perennial bridesmaid. They have finished 3rd, 4th or 5th as often as they have 2nd in the last eight Bundesliga seasons, and are currently losing the fight to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "They are still Dortmund and the idea of following in the footsteps of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham works in their favour. But the further smaller those examples in the rear window, the better chance Leverkusen have of usurping them.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea\n“I don’t why as a player I would look at that Chelsea project and think I would sign,” said Jamie Carragher last August. But really the reasons are numerous and obvious when looking past the instinct of laughing at how batsh*t it all is: money, a long-term contract, a chance to work with excellent players and coaches, regular European football, trophy-winning pedigree and life in London.",
      "There might be an element of reticence to join a club which has shown such scant and consistent disregard for players it no longer deems of value, but that rather ignores the ingrained egotism of professional athletes who believe they are so good that such treatment will never befall them.",
      "",
      "8) Inter\nChampions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, Inter have been meticulously and impressively rebuilt in the image of Simone Inzaghi and Beppe Marotta. But throwing any sort of financial weight around has not really been their thing since the ludicrous spending of the 1990s.",
      "While they have some obvious incentives to offer, it ultimately tends to come down to money and Inter are perfectly happy to target players eager to join them for sporting reasons instead.",
      "",
      "7) Bayern Munich\nThere isn’t really a box Bayern don’t tick. They have a ridiculous economic advantage in a league they are favourites to win each season, with a raft of brilliant players, a wonderful stadium, the guarantee of Champions League football every year and a charismatic coach.",
      "As the breakers of the Harry Kane trophy curse the only thing that can possibly stand against them is a bias towards Premier League teams, but the capture of England’s captain, Jamal Musiala and Michael Olise against intense competition shows that they can hold their own in those battles.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal\nOne of the crucial factors behind Arsenal’s club-record signing of Declan Rice – probably their last uncontestably brilliant transfer and definitely one of few they have had to compete against other teams for – will only apply for so long.",
      "It was said that Rice was tempted to join Arsenal over Manchester City because Mikel Arteta’s pitch involved the midfielder being ‘the driving force to take his young side to the next level’, the alternative being a role as one of many cogs in the Etihad machine. He was, if not the final piece in the Gunners jigsaw, then one of the last. And that plays to a player’s self-worth.",
      "But Arsenal will need to deliver on that promise at some point; the trophy tilts must be converted into something tangible for the process to work, not least because these near-misses undermine the reign of Arteta. It happened again in Paris.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City\nAnd for some, being an Etihad cog is a fine and fair trade-off for the opportunity to work under Pep Guardiola, win trophies and be paid handsomely for the privilege.",
      "While Guardiola and the owners are there, Manchester City have two distinct advantages over most when all things are otherwise even. That could change when the former leaves and absolutely would if the latter ever does, but Erling Haaland responded to the looming threat of demotions by signing a 1o-year contract so they will probably be fine.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool\nThey might not be the sexiest option in the Premier League but they do feel like the most sensible and stable. Klopp left behind some strong foundations and Liverpool have a higher floor than most others as a result, while Arne Slot is still trying to find their ceiling.",
      "Liverpool have finished in the Premier League top five in each of the last nine seasons and played Champions League football in seven of those. The champions they may be, but there are enough gaps in that starting XI for prospective signings to think they can break through.",
      "",
      "3) Barcelona\nThe appointment of Hansi Flick has certainly helped Barcelona regain their footing in the world game, although the emergence of some ludicrously gifted academy products might have played a part too.",
      "There remain some doubts over whether they can actually afford to register the players they sign, and the definitely absolutely certainly real corruption against them could put some off, but if any iteration of Barca come knocking you answer, and this one is finally taking steps to sort itself out.",
      "",
      "2) PSG\nThe one mark PSG had against them might soon be erased by the brilliance of Luis Enrique. Their inability to convert domestic hegemony into European glory has haunted them for years but a shift away from relying on superstars to emphasise instead the importance of the team has transformed them into the strongest unit the Parc des Princes has ever produced.",
      "They pay the highest wages and basically guarantee a couple of trophies a season when all is said and done, making it slightly easier to grin and bear living in actual Paris for a bit.",
      "",
      "1) Real Madrid\nStill the one club no-one turns down. Even in big 2025 that concept is alien to some who believe their club, players or supporters are special and different enough to counteract decades of self-fulfilling importance. They are not and never will be.",
      "Real Madrid shattered the world transfer record to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Champions League runners-up Manchester United at the end of a season in which they were eliminated 5-0 on aggregate by Liverpool in the round of 16, lost in the first round of the Copa del Rey to Real Union and finished a distant second to Barcelona in La Liga.",
      "They have tempted Trent Alexander-Arnold into ending a 21-year union with the Reds despite being comfortably beaten in this campaign’s quarter-finals by Arsenal and very likely ending up with a new manager and no trophies of note.",
      "It’s not personal and it’s not an insult. Real Madrid just tend to get what they want."

      "His report confirms Butt, Giggs, Neville and Scholes have ‘relinquished their stakes, but will continue to occupy various positions at Moor Lane’.",

      "After ‘considering multi-club models and a direct owner’, Neville and Beckham ‘decided to join forces with Declan Kelly, founder of U.S.-based advisory firm Consello, and Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association’, who ‘will co-chair Salford’s board of directors’.",
      "Regarding Salford City’s Championship plans, the report adds:",

      "‘Each member will hold a 5 per cent or 10 per cent stake, totalling at 80 per cent. The remaining 20 per cent has been earmarked for additional partners.",
      "‘None of them will have day-to-day involvement — interviews are taking place to appoint a chief executive and that person will drive matters on the ground — but their influence is set to be felt across the operation.’",

      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",

      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "“I speak with him a lot. We try to help each other,” he added. “Sometimes, from this side, it’s difficult but we try hard, try harder every game to try to score more of these chances, and the team will improve if we score more goals.",

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",
      "READ: Promoted clubs’ predictable relegation is a further sign the Premier League has broken English football",
      "",
      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",
      "",
      "26) Ben Dawson, Leicester, November-December (24)\nLeft Newcastle in the summer after 15 years in various academy and age-group coaching roles for a job on Steve Cooper’s coaching team at Leicester. Might have been an error. Named caretaker following Cooper’s departure, he oversaw a 4-1 defeat at Brentford before handing the reins to Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "",
      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",
      "What we do know for certain is that O’Neil will get the job on the back of some fine video screen analysis and Speaking Well, I Thought on Monday Night Football.",
      "",
      "24) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Leicester, December onwards (21)\nA fun little bit from this season has been Ruud van Nistelrooy being at the heart of both the best and worst bits of decision-making all season long.",
      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",
      "READ: Ranking this season’s Premier League managerial changes from Vitor to Ruud",
      "",
      "23) Sean Dyche, Everton, August-January (20)\nThe last manager rankings were compiled just days before Everton gave Dyche the Spanish Archer, and if you’ll indulge us we would like to revel in this rare example of us having got the situation pretty much spot on.",
      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",
      "He really did have them in a full-blown relegation scrap, in this Premier League season of all Premier League seasons, and wasn’t even going about it in entertaining fashion.",
      "",
      "22) Steve Cooper, Leicester August-November (22)\n‘Nobody is currently talking about Steve Cooper’ we chirped in November. Turns out we just weren’t listening. He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",
      "",
      "20) Kieran McKenna, Ipswich (7)\nSeventh? Ahem. Sorry about that. A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",
      "Luton remain the warning from history there, but for now McKenna has just about emerged from this season with reputation intact if not perhaps enhanced in the way he might have hoped or expected.",
      "",
      "19) Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham (19)\nOne of two potential absolute noodle-scratchers when the final rankings are put together a month from now.",
      "But while it is Ruben Amorim who insists winning the Europa League cannot save United’s season, it’s really Postecoglou for whom it feels more of a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",
      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",
      "",
      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",
      "",
      "17) Simon Rusk, Southampton, December and April onwards (17)\nHis two brief interim stints have delivered over 18 per cent of Southampton’s Premier League points this season and 50 per cent of their clean sheets in 13 per cent of their games, thus making Rusk – stopgap between Russell Martin’s egocentric Kompany-lite stylings and whatever it is Ivan Juric was attempting to achieve and now between Juric and whatever comes next – comfortably Southampton’s most impressive manager of the season.",
      "Had Rusk been manager for the whole season it is a clear statistical certainty that they would now have 15 points and left Derby for dust. Undeniable facts.",
      "",
      "16) Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, Everton, January (NE)\nOne hundred per cent record after a 2-0 FA Cup third-round win over League One strugglers Peterborough in a sole game in charge before David Moyes’ glorious return, you’ll never sing that.",
      "",
      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nThis is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing. Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",
      "Liverpool have a trophy. Newcastle have a trophy. Chelsea will probably have a trophy. Man City will probably have a trophy. And most humiliatingly of all, either Spurs or Man United will almost certainly have a trophy.",
      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",
      "It is not easy, this season has provided more questions than answers and exposed some familiar failings.",
      "",
      "14) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Man United, October-November (10)\nYeah, that genuinely went brilliantly well. Credit to everyone here. If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",
      "",
      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",
      "But none of that will matter at all if Glasner can become the first Crystal Palace manager to win a major honour in the FA Cup final against a Man City side who despite recent improvements remain distinctly vulnerable.",
      "",
      "12) Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton (11)\nLook, this is probably still more of a Brighton thing than a Hurzeler thing but at some point they are simply going to have to decide whether they are any good or not. Until they make up their minds about this, how on earth are any of the rest of us supposed to do so?",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",
      "",
      "10) David Moyes, Everton, January onwards (NE)\nPretty mad that we haven’t actually done an update since Moyes’ glorious homecoming to Everton, but it’s been one of the division’s more compelling good-news stories this year.",
      "The new-manager bounce is a real and unignorable phenomenon, but rarely have its effects been more pronounced than during that five-game, 13-point run just after Moyes’ came back to Goodison after 10 often difficult years away.",
      "The whole mood of the club was utterly transformed as the dread fear of relegation and losing that cherished and tightly held top-flight status just before moving into their stunning new ground gripped Everton fans.",
      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",
      "But there remain few guarantees about how it will all pan out.",
      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",
      "",
      "7) Marco Silva, Fulham (8)\nHis side just seem to have run out of puff a bit since the international break, and that’s a shame because until then Fulham appeared to have a very plausible chance to do something extraordinary.",
      "They have even in a weary phase that has delivered a crushing FA Cup defeat and four losses in six Premier League games still managed a thrilling win over Liverpool when that was still at least theoretically meaningful to all concerned.",
      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",
      "",
      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira, Wolves, December onwards (12)\nHas triggered an astonishing transformation in Wolves’ fortunes given the mess he inherited from Gary O’Neil.",
      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",
      "And as we’ve noted before: imagine the coverage both Pereira and O’Neil would be getting now had their stories this season been reversed.",
      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Did Arsenal make a ‘sack decision’ on Mikel Arteta within an hour of the final whistle in Paris? It seems unlikely.",
      "Is the ‘public glee’ at Arsenal’s defeat to PSG down to their manager Arteta and his nonsense excuses? The Gunners boss is ‘openly disliked by staff’.",
      "Presenter Gary Lineker has suggested that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta’s decision against Paris Saint-Germain proves he doesn’t trust one of his players.",
      "The entire Arsenal squad has now been fully indoctrinated by Mikel Arteta and his ‘woe is me’ schtick. Declan Rice is now just making stuff up to excuse failure.",
      "Mikel Arteta gets a massive kicking after Arsenal came up short once again. Is this just Handsome Man Syndrome in the extreme?"

      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",
      "But Rooney didn’t stop there, he doubled down on his belief that Kane is already the Englands best-ever frontman.",
      "“I think he’s England’s greatest striker. Just the goals he’s scored, firstly. But then you look at the games he’s played, the goals he’s scored, he’s just… You just hope. He’s probably got one tournament left in him. You hope he can push us now to that next level.”",

      "“In the last Euros, you had Harry coming in, you had Bellingham coming in, and they were taking up each other’s space. As a team, Harry should’ve recognised that and said, ‘No, I’m going to play up top.’ At times, you have to do that.”",

He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",

      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",
      "“I always say Drogba. He could head the ball, hold it up, and he was quick, powerful. You could play off him. That’s the kind of striker I liked.”",
      "He added, “Michael Owen (Liverpool) was unplayable for a few years. Ronaldo, R9, had everything. Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Owen, Sergio Aguero, Thierry Henry… they were incredible. But Kane, for sustainability and goals scored? He’s right up there.”",

Another attacker can run into the space he makes, and he could be useful for any club in the Premier League. He’s always learning, but at the same time, how long will he need to adapt to a new situation?",

      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",

      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game.

Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Friday 9 May 2025 00:24, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
      "Tottenham await Man Utd in the Europa League final, which takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",

      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",

      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Man Utd were beaten 4-3 at Brentford to bring up their 16th defeat of the Premier League season, their most in a league campaign for 35 years, in a result which mathematically consigns them to a bottom-half finish, but winning the Europa League would secure Champions League qualification",
      "Monday 5 May 2025 12:52, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are not ready to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League next season.",
      "United racked up their 16th defeat of the league season, their most for 35 years, with the 4-3 loss at European hopefuls Brentford, a result that mathematically consigns them to a bottom-half finish.",
      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""
