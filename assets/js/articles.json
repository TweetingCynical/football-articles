      "Premier League suitors including Manchester United and Liverpool have been put on alert over Antoine Semenyo. The Bournemouth star penned a new contract over the summer in a major coup for the Cherries - but it has now been claimed that said deal includes a release clause.",
      "Semenyo, 25, scored a career-best 11 goals for Bournemouth last season as he stepped up following the sale of Dominic Solanke. He already has six strikes to his name this term, along with three assists, in just seven appearances. And those returns have already rekindled speculation over a future move, with a number of big clubs understood to be keen on the Ghana star.",
      "In a boost for the likes of Liverpool and United - who targeted Semenyo in the summer - talkSPORT claim that his new five-year deal includes a release clause. The exact terms of the clause - which means Semenyo would be available for a fixed price - have not been disclosed, but the club are believed to value their star forward at around £75million.",
      "It's said that Bournemouth accepted agreeing to such a clause was their best chance of tying Semenyo to a longer-term deal after his performances last season.",
      "Arsenal were also linked with the London-born star last season, but their summer business - adding Ebere Eze and Noni Madueke as well as starting striker Viktor Gyokeres - have seen those links die down. Liverpool and United also added attacking reinforcements but continue to be mentioned in connection with a summer swoop for Semenyo. Tottenham has also been mentioned as a potential destination. Semenyo's old team-mate Solanke is already at the North London club, as is his international colleague Mohammed Kudus.",
      "Semenyo has been away with his country during the international break, starting World Cup qualifying wins away to Central African Republic and at home to Comoros. The victories saw Otto Addo's side clinch top spot in their group and book their place at next summer's tournament in North America.",
      "It marks a remarkable turnaround after the Black Stars failed to qualify for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations. Semenyo featured in four of the six qualifying games as Ghana finished bottom of their group behind Angola, Sudan and Niger.",
      "“I’ve grown so much at the club, both on and off the pitch, and I’m really happy to have signed ahead of returning for pre-season.,\" Semenyo said when his new Bournemouth deal was announced in July. \"From the fans to the staff and my teammates, I can’t speak highly enough of the people around the club. It’s a great place to be and I’m excited to get back to Bournemouth and continue the hard work with the new season just around the corner.”",
      "He started the season like a train, scoring twice away at Liverpool on the opening weekend of the season as Bournemouth came back from 2-0 to 2-2 before suffering a late defeat. He also scored against Brighton and Leeds, before adding two goals and an assist in a comeback victory over Fulham just before the international break.",
      "\"Semenyo is in a very good spot, he is improving every season,\" Cherries boss Andoni Iraola told Match of the Day after that win. \"I think he has confidence and we have to keep him there and encourage him to improve areas that he can improve. Now he is a player that is making the difference.\"",

      "Rio Ferdinand has taken issue with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comparison of Ruben Amorim to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. The Manchester United co-owner recently revealed on a podcast that he intends to honour his head coach's contract at Old Trafford, despite a shaky start to the season.",
      "Ratcliffe defended Amorim and referenced Mikel Arteta's initial struggles when he took over from Unai Emery at the Emirates Stadium. Speaking on his podcast, Ferdinand praised Ratcliffe for his transparency.",
      "\"You know what, I just like to hear the people that are in the driving seat of a football club come out and speak,\" said the United legend. \"That's what I like about Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "\"I think he obviously went on to a podcast to speak about something totally different, but obviously, that podcast isn't going to allow him to come on and not ask him about Man United.",
      "\"So, it's just refreshing that somebody in his position actually talks,\" Ferdinand added, before questioning Ratcliffe's comments about Arteta. \"Now, do I agree exactly with what he said?",
      "\"I understand the sentiment – if you go through the facts, I don't think it's the right person to draw a comparison with. You look at Arteta – there are similarities in some of the stats.",
      "\"The big one is that he improved the team from 10th to finish eighth in his first year. Amorim took his team from 14th to finish 15th. There was also flexibility in the way Arteta had his team.",
      "\"I think he had about seven different formations in his first 50 matches, just trying things out. The improvement line would have been a bit more consistent, and you go, 'I can see it happening'.",
      "\"Whereas with Amorim, you look at him and there isn't as much consistency or positives that are coming out of it that you're going, 'oh, I can actually see it clearly, it's hitting me between my eyes, I couldn't let this guy go'.",
      "\"I think right now, we're at a stage with United and Amorim, [where] I just want to see that consistency of some results coming through, performance alongside that, and an idea that you go, 'oh, I can see this training ground stuff really paying off'.",
      "\"The consistency with all of those three different elements isn't there right now, and I'm hoping he can get that right.\" Ferdinand was making reference to remarks delivered by Ratcliffe on 'The Business podcast'.",
      "At the beginning of the international break, the INEOS chief insisted that he retains authority over football matters at the club. When asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to dismiss Amorim, Ratcliffe, who has controlled just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, declared: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "He continued: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond. That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United.",
      "\"We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Highlighting his long-term vision, the 72-year-old said: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "When questioned if he'll honour the United boss' contract, Ratcliffe responded: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week...\"",

      "Former Manchester United flop Bebe might have felt that a World Cup spot was a distant memory. The Portuguese-born forward failed to make an appearance for the country of his birth and eventually went on to declare for African minnows Cape Verde back in 2022.",
      "As it stands, the nation sit 70th in the current FIFA rankings. But that has not held them back, with a 3-0 win against Eswatini seeing them secure a spot at next summer’s tournament in the USA.",
      "Former Manchester United star, Bebe, has earned 27 caps for the nation since declaring his allegiance to the African nation in 2022. In that time, he has scored six goals.",
      "One of his strikes was a brilliant 50-yard free-kick in a 3-0 victory over Mozambique at last year’s African Cup of Nations. While the 36-year-old’s contributions have been limited as of late, having not made an international appearance since November 2024, he has still contributed.",
      "Bebe has still made two appearances - both of which were starts - in Cape Verde’s qualification campaign. It looks unlikely that he will be at the tournament but he will be satisfied with the fact that he has helped his adoptive nation make history.",
      "\"It's the stuff of dreams, it really is,\" Cape Verde and Shamrock Rovers star Pico Lopes said upon the country sealing their spot at the World Cup.",
      "\"I know that's thrown about a lot, but anyone who has that aspiration of being a footballer, there's probably one tournament that everyone would love to play in - it's the World Cup.",
      "\"It's the most prestigious tournament we have in our sport and any person starting out kicking a football would love to see themselves representing their country at a World Cup. It's a dream come true and I'll talk about it to anyone who listens for the rest of my life!\"",
      "While Bebe’s international career has so far been storied, the same could certainly be said of his club career. He arrived at Old Trafford in 2010 from Vitória de Guimarães but he made just seven appearances before leaving permanently for Benfica.",
      "“Every day I called my agent to ask him to get me out. It was a bad time,\" Bebe told Goal about his United exit. \"When you do not play, even if you are at a great club, then you are not happy, so why continue?",
      "\"I remember that I was going for a United game with the youth team, and my agent called me and told me I had been sold to Benfica. It was the best moment of my life!\"",
      "He went on to play for Eibar and Rayo Vallecano in Spain, leaving the latter last year. Bebe has remained in Spain, having represented Racing Ferrol and lower league side Ibiza.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned that Sir Jim Ratcliffe's claim that he has three years to prove himself at Manchester United is \"ridiculous\". The Portuguese head coach is approaching the one-year anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but has failed to deliver results so far.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and, despite spending more than £200million on fresh talent during the summer transfer window, they have lost three of their first seven games this term. Reports recently emerged that Amorim was at risk of being sacked had the Red Devils not beaten Sunderland before the international break.",
      "That speculation was dismissed by United co-owner Ratcliffe, who said Amorim would need three years to show he is a \"great coach\". The Ineos owner's comments, made during an interview on the Times' The Business podcast, have now been torn apart by former United goalkeeper Ben Foster.",
      "Contrary to Ratcliffe's remarks, the ex-England and Wrexham shot-stopper believes it will only take a short run of poor results for Amorim to be relieved of his duties this season.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"Nobody's got three years, it's ridiculous. You can't ever say that. If Man United go and lose five out of their next six games, he'll get sacked. It's as simple as that.",
      "\"That's how football works nowadays and I don't care who you are. Arsenal could be the same, or even Liverpool could be the same. If you lose five or six out of seven or eight, you're getting chopped.\"",
      "Asked if Amorim will be given time to succeed, Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Despite Ratcliffe's backing, Amorim has only managed to register 37 points out of a possible 102 in the Premier League during his stint in charge. United's humiliating loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup in August did little to aid his cause.",
      "Reports surfaced recently that club chiefs have held discussions with key squad members to assess the current situation. United chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox are understood to have led the talks.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes is among the leading figures whose opinions are said to have been sought. While it's been claimed the discussions were informal, the alleged move has been seen as an indicator that all is not well at United.",
      "Oliver Glasner, Eddie Howe, Gareth Southgate and Diego Simeone are among the managers who have been linked with the United job should it become vacant. However, the current signals from the club suggest that Amorim's position is safe, at least for the time being.",

      "Seven players could miss Liverpool vs Manchester United on Sunday as the Premier League returns to action. United boss Ruben Amorim has seen his squad's fitness concerns ease in recent weeks, with Matheus Cunha, Diogo Dalot and Mason Mount all making their comebacks.",
      "Mount marked his first start since August by netting a goal in the 2-0 victory over Sunderland before the October international break. Following that success, Amorim is aiming for back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since taking the reins.",
      "One major boost for the Red Devils is that they could be heading to Merseyside with a fully-fit squad. Lisandro Martinez is edging closer to a return after getting back to training, although he's likely to be gradually reintroduced after damaging his ACL in February.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui missed United's last match but could be in contention to face Liverpool. Liverpool boss Arne Slot, meanwhile, has some potentially significant worries over several key players, including two relatively new ones.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch stepped in at centre-back when Konate was subbed off last weekend, but Slot might not have that option if the former remains sidelined. That's because Gravenberch was substituted at half-time during the Netherlands' World Cup qualifying victory over Finland.",
      "\"Ryan indicated he had some minor hamstring problems,\" said Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman. \"Of course, we didn't take any risks with that.\"",
      "Post-match, Gravenberch revealed: \"It was partly fitness related. The season is long, so it was a precaution. I'm feeling good and I have the coach's confidence.\"",

      "The anniversary of Erik ten Hag's firing as Manchester United coach will throw up mixed memories for those around the club. And as Ruben Amorim contends with ongoing rumours suggesting he too is set for the axe, many will wonder where the club might be had Ten Hag remained at the helm.",
      "The Dutchman's dismissal came as a surprise to many, Ten Hag included. And as this month officially marks one year since the coach's unceremonious exit, it may not be long before his successor is also shown the door.",
      "The Daily Mail reported in October 2024 that Ten Hag was \"in the dark\" over his axing despite a torrid run of form at the time. United sat 14th in the Premier League and were reeling from a defeat at West Ham, having won just one of their last eight games under the former Ajax boss.",
      "Ten Hag survived a summer scare after winning the FA Cup to retain his place at the Old Trafford helm. But despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe handing the tactician a one-year contract extension, he was fired from his duties just a few months later.",
      "That swift rise and fall likely contributed to the sense of surprise after he was hauled into an office at Carrington around this time last year. And it's a walk-the-plank moment that could lie in Amorim's not-too-distant future if things don't improve swiftly.",
      "The Red Devils went into the international break on the back of three straight home wins, the most recent of which was a 2-0 victory over Sunderland. However, Amorim's men are still waiting on their first road win of the campaign and sit 10th in the Premier League.",
      "Like Amorim, Ten Hag wasn't short of backing from his superiors, not that long before he was let go. The summer of 2024 saw United pour more than £200million on new signings, very similar to the sum recently splurged during Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "One could perhaps consider Ten Hag naïve for not anticipating his axe given United's run of results prior to the split. By that logic, Amorim also shouldn't count his chickens at Old Trafford after overseeing an all-time record-low Premier League finish of 15th and struggling to improve matters this term.",
      "Ineos billionaire Ratcliffe hasn't yet managed to engineer the new dawn of success at United, he hoped for when investing in the club. And as he nears the second anniversary of his partial takeover, it may not be long before he's averaging one sacked coach per year in Manchester.",
      "For the time being, at least, Amorim appears to have the Briton's support. But the show of faith is eerily similar to the backing Ten Hag received not long before he was told to pack his bags.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" admitted Ratcliffe during a recent appearance on The Business Podcast. \"Amorim is a good guy. I would say Ruben needs to demonstrate that he's a great coach over three years.",
      "\"That’s where I would be - three years - because football is not overnight. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, he had a miserable time the first couple of years.\"",

      "Brighton chief Tony Bloom has revealed that he told Manchester United in no uncertain terms that Carlos Baleba was NOT for sale. The Red Devils were linked with a move for the Cameroonian this summer as Ruben Amorim attempted to bolster his midfield options.",
      "Brighton reportedly want to bank around €120million (£104.6m) to sell Baleba, a price that United were not willing to reach. Seagulls chairman Tony Bloom has now offered an insight into the negotiations and claimed that United quickly dropped their interest after being told that the midfielder was not on the market.",
      "Speaking to The Argus, he said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.”",
      "Baleba, 21, eventually ended up staying with Brighton and remains under contract until 2028. Had he departed, he would have followed in a long line of players to have left the club including Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Alexis Mac Allister, Leandro Trossard and Robert Sanchez, among others.",
      "Bloom though insists that the Seagulls will not be dubbed as a selling club. He added: “I don't view ourselves as a selling club per se, because I think that every club, almost every club, is a selling club.",
      "“And by that, I'm talking about their best players going, because that's just the football ecosystem. And we know that other clubs pay much more significant salaries than we can. We can't do that.",
      "“And so when a player has the opportunity to go to a really big club and they're offering a huge amount of money, it has to be right timing for the club.",
      "“It has to be the right transfer fee. But then we, of course, we allow players to go. That happens across the board. Sometimes it's more difficult. Negotiations are more difficult than other times. But, again, no different to any other club.”",
      "Brighton have had a mixed start to the season under boss Fabian Hurzeler. They sit 12th after two wins from their opening seven league games.",
      "Meanwhile, United appear to have shifted focus onto alternative midfield targets which include Borussia Dortmund star Jobe Bellingham.",

I’m not sure if he did but his name’s not been mentioned. I think he told me in confidence so I’m not going to tell you. I don’t think he was going for it. They contacted him and he was going to meet him in London the day after.”",

He remains one of just two men who managed to take the Red Devils to second in the Premier League, but during his tenure he was dealt some heavy defeats and faced accusations of his lack of style.",
      "Rangers are also thought to be considering Michael Carrick, who was Solskjaer's assistant in Manchester. Former Sheffield Wednesday boss Rohl has also impressed Ibrox bosses during the process and remains in the hunt for the job. He has been out of work since leaving the Owls in July and was contacted by Rangers in the summer before they ultimately decided to appoint Martin.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side go into the contest off the back of a win whilst the Reds had endured three straight losses prior to the international break. However wins on the red side of Merseyside have been tough to come by in recent years. Last term, despite the odds being stacked against them, United secured a 2-2 draw and missed a late chance to claim a shock three points.",
      "Stifling Liverpool's attack will be key but Parker fears for Shaw when he's up against Mo Salah, who has a stellar record against the Manchester outfit. Parker has been critical of the ex-Southampton player and believes he could struggle to contain the Egyptian superstar with a particular dig at the player's work rate.",
      "He told The Devils’ Advocate podcast: \"You look at the teams they have played against and they can’t handle pace and energy levels.\"",
      "\"If Liverpool play in front of them, it will be great but I don’t think they will. I think they will try and turn them around, especially on the left side with Luke Shaw. Salah is going to be looking to run in behind with and without the ball, knowing the laziness of Luke Shaw, who he will be pulling at his shirt all the time and little things like that.\"",
      "Shaw has been the subject of individual criticism in the past. Roy Keane was another ex-player to take aim, the Irishman said he'd \"thrown the towel in\" during the Manchester derby. The defender himself has acknowledged that some of the critique has been fair.",
      "United's lacklustre start to the season has been partly blamed on Amorim's refusal to change his style of play and specifically his formation. The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has continually claimed his philosophy is not the reason for the poor results with Parker claiming the players have to shoulder the blame.",
      "He said: \"They haven’t got the discipline, trustworthy people to play for what the manager wants to do. You can moan and moan about his system, but at the end of the day, they want to use this word elite about these players of today, which is absolutely rubbish to be perfectly honest, but if they were that elite, they would be clever enough to go bang and do it.\"",

      "Manchester United are interested in a deal for Jobe Bellingham, with Ruben Amorim emphatically approving a move for the Borussia Dortmund star. The Red Devils have had a new midfielder right at the top of their shopping list for some time.",
      "They failed to get a deal done in the summer, but are already scouring Europe for potential additions. And as per reports in Germany, Dortmund’s Bellingham has emerged as an option for United following his slow start to life with the Bundesliga giants. The former Sunderland man penned a five-year deal with Dortmund in the summer for £25m. But things haven’t quite gone to plan, with the 20-year-old having been afforded just three starts over the opening months of the campaign.",
      "That has led to suggestions that he could leave, with German outlet Bild reporting that United are among a number of clubs monitoring his future, with Amorim a big fan of his talents.",
      "The Portuguese coach reportedly sees Bellingham as an ideal addition for his 3-4-2-1 system due to his physical attributes. United, though, are not the only Premier League side interested in Bellingham. Crystal Palace are also thought to be keeping an eye on him as they search for potential replacements for Adam Wharton, who has been linked with Liverpool and Real Madrid.",
      "Doubts over Bellingham’s future come amid an ongoing row between Dortmund and the midfielder’s family. It was recently claimed that his dad Mark was left furious at the player being substituted in a recent 3-3 draw with St Pauli and had a heated argument with chief Sebastian Kehl in the tunnel. And it has since been confirmed that a ban has been enforced when it comes to families.",
      "BVB's managing director, Lars Ricken, said: “We got Jobe Bellingham because we really built a relationship of trust with the parents over the years.",
      "\"Now the family flew in especially for their son's first Bundesliga game and wanted to meet Jobe after the game. They stood in the hallway to the locker room and had an emotional conversation with Sebastian, which, however, is not a problem at all given this relationship.",
      "\"In the future, though, we will ensure that players, coaches, and any officials have access to the locker room area, so that we no longer get into trouble by commenting on such news. But today everything has been resolved - no drama.\"",
      "Despite the issue now being put to bed, England icon Sir Geoff Hurst recently took aim at Bellingham senior for his actions. He said: \"A thing that has irritated me is a picture in one of the papers about the most powerful man in English football - and it's Jude Bellingham's father.",
      "\"He was complaining when his son was taken off in a game - and that is an absolute joke. If you don't eradicate that kind of thing, that is an absolute disgrace.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's decision to overlook Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United has been backed by Steve Nicol, who claims the midfielder has been \"found out\" and does nothing to help the team out of possession.",
      "Mainoo burst onto the scene under Erik ten Hag and became an instant hit. That year he scored in an FA Cup final win and his meteoric rise was completed when he played for England during their run to the final of Euro 2024.",
      "The midfielder's career has hit a roadblock since Ten Hag was replaced by Amorim, who hasn't given Mainoo anywhere near the same amount of minutes as his predecessor. Nicol, a serial winner with Liverpool in the 1980s, concedes the 20-year-old is a fantastic player with the ball.",
      "However, he's claimed that Mainoo doesn't do nearly enough to stop the opposition and isn't being enough of a buffer for the back four. Casemiro has been playing ahead of him - which Nicol believes is a scathing reflection of the player.",
      "He told ESPN: \"In my opinion, Mainoo is great with the ball at his feet but when the opposition has the ball, he doesn’t do enough. In fact, he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t stop people getting at Man Utd's back four. And the fact that that is one of the biggest problems United have and this guy still can’t figure it out.",
      "\"I think basically he’s been found out because at the end of the day, when you play for the top clubs and you want to be challenging, your players have to contribute on both sides of the ball. And if there is one thing Mainoo doesn’t do, it’s contribute defensively. The fact that Casemiro is starting over him consistently tells you that there is a problem and the kid is not as good as we thought he was when he first burst onto the scene.\"",
      "Mainoo is yet to play 90 minutes at all in the Premier League this term. He was an unused sub in the first two games and has only played a half on one occasion, that being against Burnley. Otherwise he's been resigned to brief cameos off the bench.",
      "His only 90 minutes came in the humiliating loss at Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and Amorim has regularly been quizzed on his use of the United academy graduate. But the Portuguese boss insists he sees huge need for improvement in the youngster's game.",
      "\"I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"He will have opportunities like the other guys. If I feel during the week that he’s the best player to play, he’s going to play and I proved that already to every player here. I believe a lot in him. I have the same thing [opinion] that you have and that is a top, top player, but he can be so much better, so I’m focused on that.\"",

      "Liverpool will soon be getting set to face Manchester United. And new frontman Alexander Isak will be on the hunt for his first Premier League goal under Arne Slot.",
      "A 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last month ended the Reds' perfect start to this campaign and that result was followed by two more losses - to Galatasaray in the Champions League and another late on at Chelsea. Ruben Amorim's visit Anfield next, with Liverpool looking to bounce back.",
      "Isak has scored just the once as a Liverpool player so far but comes with a hefty reputation after signing for a British record fee from Newcastle. But Liverpool hero Owen thinks it is too early to doubt him and has warned any pessimists to write him and the Reds off at their peril.",
      "\"Alexander Isak is coming back after not really having a pre-season, so he's coming in and out of the starting XI to try and get sharp and fit,\" Owen told the Liverpool Echo.",
      "\"If I was putting a fan's hat on, I'd be relaxed overall. I'd be obviously disappointed with the Chelsea defeat, but Stamford Bridge is a tough place to go, it's never easy.",
      "\"I certainly can't remember ever winning there as a player. That game could have gone either way, and it's not like Liverpool are playing badly. I wouldn't be as hot and bothered as some people. It just shows how fickle football is and how quick it can change.\"",
      "Another Liverpool star who has been off with his national side is defender Robertson. His Scotland enjoyed two wins from two over the international break, beating Belarus 2-1 on Sunday and going joint-top of UEFA World Cup qualifying Group C.",
      "But some were not convinced. It was expected Steve Clarke's side would best the winless Belarus by more than a single goal and after the full-time whistle boos could be heard from the Hampden crowd.",
      "Robertson addressed this discontent, saying: \"It doesn't feel good, we can be honest with that. It doesn't feel like a win at the minute, and I think you can see that by our reaction at the end, which is hugely frustrating. The performance is nowhere near where we need it to be.",
      "\"It's a hugely frustrating night - we felt that in the stands. We'll take that on board, but come November, we've got the chance to go to a World Cup and that's what we're focused on.\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli endured a tough 24 months on the books at Anfield after a £16m move. He scored just four goals in 28 appearances during the 2014/15 season before being shipped off to AC Milan on loan.",
      "He would then sign for Nice and since leaving Liverpool he has played for seven different clubs. But after departing Italian side Genoa he is currently unemployed and admits he has reached a \"dead end.\"",
      "\"To be honest, I'm at a dead end,\" Balotelli told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Physically, I feel good, I'm training for myself. This summer, I had offers from abroad, but secretly I hoped to stay in Italy for another year or two. But that opportunity never came.",
      "\"I'm fit and just waiting for the right opportunity. Football is still my life, but I only want to come back when I feel I can really contribute again.\"",

      "Manchester United hoped a busy summer transfer window would be the answer to Ruben Amorim's problems. However, at least one piece of business appears to have backfired after one of the new arrivals has been voted the \"worst summer signing\" by a panel of agents.",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford has been told his time at Old Trafford may not be done despite making such a strong impression at Barcelona. The outcast was sent on loan to the Camp Nou and has been looked highly promising thus far, but one former Red Devil has cautioned any permanent move may not be set in stone.",
      "Although things appear to be on the up for Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford, not everyone agrees that United got a good deal. In fact, an agent survey put together by The Athletic voted for the Slovenian as the worst signing of the summer (predominantly examining the Premier League).",
      "The Red Devils shelled out £73.6million (if all add-on conditions are met) to sign the towering striker from RB Leipzig. Sesko, 22, was brought in to replace Rasmus Hojlund (on loan at Napoli) after witnessing an excruciating struggle for goals last season.",
      "After failing to score in his last six games for United, Sesko went into the international break having scored in back-to-back games. But that didn't prevent him from receiving the most votes for worst summer signing, with twice the amount of votes received by runner-up James Trafford.",
      "\"A lot of money for not much of a pedigree,\" wrote one unimpressed agent in his explanation. Another commented: \"Way too much money and much too soon.\"",
      "Given the unceremonious manner of his United exit and the success he's enjoyed on loan away from the club, it would be hard for some to imagine the player back at Old Trafford. The 27-year-old has contributed three goals and five assists for the Blaugrana so far this season, making the potential £25m it would take to sign him permanently look that much more valuable.",
      "However, ex-United star and 1999 treble-winner Wes Brown has suggested his days at Carrington may not be over. And it's Brown's belief that Rashford's resurgence may be just the impetus needed to convince United bosses their asset deserves another chance.",
      "\"It's a tough one. He's there for the season, and then nothing is guaranteed,\" he told 10bet Casino. \"I said before that I thought he would do well. He's got the mentality to succeed, and we'd need to see how it worked for him, and it's started really well so far.",
      "\"Would I bring him back? I can't say for sure, because it depends on what the manager wants next season, and it'll be up to him and the player. You can see, though, that Marcus is loving life in Barcelona, and when your life is good, your football is good. It's as simple as that.\"",
      "He continued: \"He's enjoying it, and I hope it carries on for him, regardless of the club he's at. If it was decided that he comes back to United and he's still in this form, then it's only a good thing.\"",
      "The eyes of many a United fan lit up when talk arose of a late summer bid for Brighton's Baleba, only for the club to baulk at his £100m valuation. But the Red Devils' recruitment staff may have the next big thing in their sights after UOL reported they're interested in signing Corinthians anchor Breno Bidon.",
      "There could well be a need for midfield additions in 2026 amid speculation Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo will both move on next summer. Casemiro, 33, is nearing the end of his contract at Old Trafford, while Mainoo doesn't appear to figure in Amorim's plans at present.",
      "Bidon, 20, is a rounded asset who can function in both halves of the pitch and has already made 87 senior appearances for Corinthians. He also currently shares a dressing room with ex-United winger Memphis Depay, though that could work for against the English giants.",
      "According to UOL, Manchester City, Napoli and Wolves are also interested in the player, with Middle Eastern clubs also in the hunt. However, there is a slight need to act quickly considering Eredivisie champions PSV are understood to have already tabled an £8m offer.",

However, the former midfielder has not worked in that capacity for six years since departing Forest with Martin O'Neill.",

      "Marcus Rashford has blamed an 'inconsistent environment' for his struggle to maintain his best form in recent seasons. The forward accepts he needs to improve his reliability, but suggested his Manchester United surroundings did not provide the best platform for him to perform at the peak of his powers.",
      "Rashford, 27, joined Barcelona on loan at the start of this season and has thrived since settling in at the Catalan club. Barca had reservations over signing the England international, but now appear happy to activate the option in his deal to sign him permanently.",
      "The United academy product leads the La Liga side in goal contributions. The attacker has scored three goals and provided five assists in his last seven outings for Barcelona.",
      "The forward's form follows a difficult period. Rashford dropped out of United's first team plans following Ruben Amorim's arrival before moving to Aston Villa on loan, and being a member of United's 'bomb squad' while his team-mates went on pre-season tour this summer.",
      "Rashford has worked under eight different coaches at United since making his debut under Louis van Gaal in 2016. The period has seen Europa League and FA Cup success for the Red Devils but they have failed to find the success realised under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "And Rashford is hoping to bring some consistency to his life and the way he trains to discover his best form once again. \"Consistency is a massive part of it,\" he told ITV.",
      "\"I feel like I’ve been in an inconsistent environment for a very, very long time. So it’s even more difficult to be consistent then.",
      "\"Consistency is what I need to bring into my game. I’m looking to do that, I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "\"When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything, not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life, in the way you train and we’ve just had so many changes so far in my career.",
      "\"I have to look forward and that’s definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on and to be at my best more often. When I’m at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport, so being there is a special thing for me.\"",

Zidane has already thrived at another of his former clubs, leading Real Madrid to multiple Champions League successes, and Sacchi hopes the Frenchman can repeat the trick at the club he thrived at between 1996 and 2001.",

      "\"I confess I have hope,\" Sacchi wrote for La Gazzetta dello Sport (via Goal). \"He was a great Juventus player, he became a champion in the black and white jersey, he had a maestro like Marcello Lippi as his coaching mentor, so why not imagine him on the Juventus bench?",
      "\"Someone like him, someone who always put attacking football first, someone who believes in team play and talent at the service of the team. Our championship could only benefit from his presence.\"",
      "Sacchi also explained what he admired about Zidane's Madrid teams. \"His Real Madrid played an attacking game, showed courage, kept possession of the ball most of the time, dominated the opponent through a dense network of passes and the fans admired him,\" he said. \"I ask myself: why isn't a coach who created such a machine of beauty working?\"",
      "Zidane's latest comments about his future came during an appearance at the Trento Sport Festival in Italy. \"I will definitely return.” the 53-year-old said.",

The victory provided some respite for the Red Devils boss, who has faced questions regarding his reluctance to abandon his favoured system.",

      "Joey Barton has launched a furious X-rated tirade against Wayne Rooney and the ex-Manchester United star's suspicion of conspiracy over the dramatic circumstances in which Manchester City claimed the Premier League title with a final-day win over Queens Park Rangers.",
      "United were already celebrating winning the league after beating Sunderland, before City launched a late comeback, capped off by Sergio Aguero's iconic strike, to win the Premier League. QPR went into the game fighting for top-flight survival but knew they would be safe before the final whistle.",
      "That has seen Rooney voice criticism that the Hoops were happy to let City stage their comeback. The former England captain was recently criticised by Djibril Cisse for questioning the fact that the forward was seen 'celebrating' with City players after the game.",
      "And now, Barton has rubbished Rooney's theory and explained why it was incorrect. The ex-QPR and Man City midfielder did not hesitate to take digs at Rooney either.",

      "\"I'm only commenting on it because he referenced me in it. Half of our team knew we were safe and stayed up and half of our team didn't. You can see when you see it.",
      "\"Five or six of the team did. I can hear it getting shouted from the sidelines. We had all been in City's academy. You had Nedum Onuoha, Shaun Wright-Phillips and myself. So we would have wanted Manchester City to win the league over Man United, make no bones about that.",
      "\"But at the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people's results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",

      "\"You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don't think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.\"",
      "\"So Wayne, and the other Man United fans - and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me - no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That's where the buck stops with me.",

      "\"To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don't win the league is b****cks.",

      "The one-year extension in Maguire's deal was triggered in January, meaning his contract expires in June 2026, and the defender will be hopeful of agreeing fresh terms at Old Trafford.",
      "Maguire has continued to earn the salary agreed upon in the contract he signed when arriving from Leicester City, thanks to the one-year extension clause. However, negotiating a fresh deal gives United the opportunity to offer a reduced wage packet, which is usually the sticking point during such talks.",
      "The 32-year-old was at the peak of his powers when he arrived in Manchester. He joined in a £80million transfer, but now finds himself at a different stage of his career six years on.",
      "Inevitably, that means Maguire will not be offered a new deal at his current salary - the new offer will reflect his role in the dressing room and his fair value.",
      "Matt Hargreaves, director of football negotiations at United, will liaise with Maguire's representatives over the next few months.",
      "Sources have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves is said to be a smart operator, so a fair offer should be submitted to Maguire, and the likelihood is that both parties will reach an agreement as there is willingness on both sides.",
      "The number of years offered remains to be seen. Maguire would probably love to sign for another three, while United might feel that a one-year deal is most logical considering he turns 33 in March.",
      "The compromise might be offering a two-year contract to Maguire, who has not been a regular starter in the Premier League so far this season, but who still can provide plenty of quality.",
      "Maguire's performances last season were excellent. United disappointed collectively and finished 15th, but he emerged with credit whenever he played, which couldn't be said about most of his colleagues.",
      "The England international missed some time on the pitch due to a handful of small injuries. Maguire suffered a knock in training, then he was sidelined with a muscle issue and subsequently had a calf problem.",
      "Maguire did not deal with such problems as often earlier in his career, but a fresh two-year deal makes sense when his admirable leadership qualities at Carrington are also considered.",
      "He has demonstrated remarkable mental strength - Maguire was booed by Dublin 'United fans' during the 2023 pre-season - to rise above intense scrutiny to become a fan favourite.",
      "Maguire's redemption arc has been uplifting, although he has remained the same person at the training ground irrespective of external noise: he is an example and a model professional.",
      "Young players are able to approach Maguire for counsel and some believe he's become a better leader since losing the captain's armband due to the pressure associated with the responsibility.",
      "Maguire is the kind of player you want in your dressing room and it would cost more to find a like-for-like replacement, in terms of his quality and character, than agreeing a new deal.",
      "Jason Wilcox presented Maguire with a framed shirt for reaching 250 United appearances before the victory against Chelsea last month. Maguire has experienced highs and lows during his time at the club, but the general consensus among supporters is now that he's been a good signing.",
      "Reflecting on his time at United, Maguire recently said: “To play that amount of games is a huge privilege. The dream of a young kid, growing up in Sheffield, to play one game for Manchester United would have been a dream come true, but to play 250 I feel really lucky, really grateful.\"",
      "There should be more games for Maguire to play in a United shirt beyond 2025/2026.",

He managed just four Premier League goals with the pressure on the 22-year-old, Amorim decided this summer that the striker's future was better served away from the Theatre of Dreams.",

Rasmus’ abilities fit very, very well to the Premier League and English football so I think it was a good signing, it was well scouted and I think Rasmus proved both before he came to United and also now as he left for Napoli that he has strong abilities as a powerful No.9 and he can score goals.\"",
      "While there may have been some confusion as to why Hojlund was suddenly the first choice at Old Trafford, Mouroux was keen to stress that there was never any animosity towards United from the family. \"I last saw him was at the beginning of his time at United and it was when he was scoring goals,\" he added. \"At that point he was very happy. I have chatted with his father on a few occasions since then, also during the more difficult period at United.",
      "\"And I must say I think this family is extraordinary in every sense of the word when it comes to professionalism. They keep their nose on track and even during the difficult times, they are focused on what they can do to improve.",
      "\"I’ve never been in dialogue with the family at any point where they felt particularly frustrated. They were more constructive around wanting to be a success with and for United.\"",
      "Hojlund's loan move to Napoli has seen him reinvigorate his career with goals coming a lot more frequently. Mouroux feels that has a lot to do with the difference in environment in Naples.",
      "\"When you come from a team that isn’t living up to expectations, it will take a toll on a player’s confidence and it takes a toll on how you interact within the team,\" he said. \"So it takes a lot of effort to try and break that cycle.",
      "\"It is just the fact that he has come into a different environment, a breath of fresh air, new ideas, a new team that has been successful and he has managed to go with that flow. He also comes in with more experience after two years at United, he is a better player now.",
      "\"He also came from the Italian league so he knows what it is about and he has McTominay who comes from the same environment as him so he can help with the on-boarding. I just think he is in a really good environment for him.",
      "\"I think it was the right decision for him to go, and his performances show that.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford is currently on international duty with England.",
      "Rashford sat down with ITV Sport before the Three Lions' game against Latvia and was asked about Thomas Tuchel's assessment that he only needs consistency to become world-class.",
      "His answer received attention from the media. \"For sure, consistency is a massive part of it. I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time,\" said Rashford.",
      "\"So it is even more difficult to be consistent, but I completely agree, I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "\"When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career but I have to look forward and that it definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often. When I am at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport.\"",
      "The first part of Rashford's answer has been interpreted as a critique of United over the last nine years, but some fans have argued the 27-year-old must take responsibility himself.",
      "Rashford and those supporters are correct - both can be true. United have been a dysfunctional club, which has not been conducive to high performance, but Rashford has not helped himself along the way.",
      "Louis van Gaal handed Rashford his debut in 2016 and he played for a further four permanent United managers - Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Three interim United managers, Michael Carrick, Ralf Rangnick and Ruud van Nistelrooy, have also worked with Rashford, so it's fair to say the environment at United has been \"inconsistent.\"",
      "Those managerial changes at United have happened in the same timeframe as Pep Guardiola's reign at Manchester City (Guardiola was appointed at the Etihad in the summer of 2016).",
      "There is no denying that the environment has not been right at United, although it would be naive to suggest that the situation at Carrington is the only reason for Rashford's inconsistency.",
      "There have been concerns about Rashford's off-field behaviour in recent years, and he even survived a boozy jaunt to Belfast because Ten Hag believed it would be detrimental to freeze him out of his plans.",
      "Ten Hag disciplined Rashford, but Amorim subsequently saw something he did not agree with, which led him to drop the academy graduate for the Manchester derby last December.",
      "A combination of the environment at United and Rashford's poor choices has contributed to his inconsistency, ultimately preventing him from becoming a world-class player.",
      "There are no more excuses for Rashford at Barcelona. The Catalan club have a winning environment, with a superb manager in place, and everything is right for him to succeed.",
      "Rashford appears to have taken that opportunity, scoring three goals and recording six assists in Spain, although he was recently dropped for a game against Getafe after being late to a team meeting.",
      "The Wythenshawe-born forward was only two minutes late, but Hansi Flick enforced a disciplinary rule that meant he lost his starting role. Rashford might have been stuck in traffic or overslept. And it was just two minutes, but he is paid handsomely to do his job and should be able to follow the rules.",
      "Everyone knows Rashford has the talent to be regarded as world-class - he just needs to get the basics right.",

      "Hello and welcome to live coverage of all the latest Manchester United news on Tuesday, October 14.",
      "The Reds' season is currently on hold due to the second international break of the season and talk has quietened around Ruben Amorim's suitability for the top job at Old Trafford for now after a 2-0 defeat of Sunderland last time out.",
      "Amorim's future may well have been knocked down the news agenda but United were plunged into further uncertainty last week when the mega-rich Saudi Arabian government official Turki Al-Sheikh made huge claims about a takeover of the club on social media.",
      "That sparked speculation online about what this could mean for the Reds' immediate future, with further claims that the supposed investors were based in the United Arab Emirates and had approached United legends about backing their bid.",
      "We will have all the latest on that, top transfer headlines and injury news as the Reds' return to action with a clash against Liverpool this weekend edges closer...",
      "Tony Bloom has suggested it would take a lot for Brighton to cash in on Carlos Baleba. Speaking to The Argus, the Seagulls owner said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga.",
      "\"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season...\"",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano provided an update on Kobbie Mainoo's future. The journalist said: \"At the moment, Kobbie is not creating any problems, training at his best, trying his best for Man United, but he’s still not a regular starter and Kobbie wants to play.",
      "\"That has not changed since August. In August, Man United said, ‘No, you stay here. No chance even for a loan’. And Kobbie only wanted a loan and never a permanent transfer. In January, we will see because it’s still October.\"",
      "Romano added: \"So now full focus on training, working hard for United, but for January, the case of Kobbie Mainoo might become interesting again because several clubs from England, from Spain, and also from Italy, Napoli, and not only, are interested in Kobbie, on loan.\"",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Paul Scholes questioned the the loan of Rasmus Hojlund and the signing of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"You look at Rasmus Hojlund, 22-year-old kid, came when he was 20 years of age,\" said the United legend. \"One centre-forward for Manchester United and everything was on him, the pressure was on him and he couldn’t handle it.",
      "\"He should be coming in and and out of the team. There should be three or four centre-forwards there. This summer, what do they do? They let him go and they buy another one, very similar, exactly the same!",
      "\"22 years of age. He’s started ok, he looks like he’s getting better. But where’s the common sense in that?\"",
      "According to talkSPORT, Brighton have no plans to sell Carlos Baleba at the end of the season. The 21-year-old midfielder was heavily linked with a move to United in the summer, but a deal never materialised.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler recently claimed that Baleba, who's had a shaky start to the season, has been affected by speculation linking him with Old Trafford. The Cameroonian sees his contract at the Amex Stadium expire in June 2028.",
      "According to Team Talk, Chelsea have 'intensified' their efforts in the race to sign Adam Wharton. The 21-year-old midfielder has recently been linked with a move to United following his impressive performances for Crystal Palace.",
      "The report claims that the Blues view Wharton as a 'long-term solution to bolster their midfield', with Romeo Lavia often out of action. It's said that the Eagles could demand at least £70m for the Englishman, who they want to keep until at least the summer of 2026.",
      "Team Talk reckons that Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool have also shortlisted Wharton as a target.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Barcelona have tied Frenkie De Jong down to a new contract which will keep him at the Camp Nou until at least June 2029. The 28-year-old midfielder had been linked with a move to United on numerous occasions in the past, but a deal never materialised.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, Mick Brown claimed that United have set their sights on Aleksandar Pavlovic at Bayern Munich. The former chief scout at Old Trafford said: \"We know Amorim wants to sign a midfielder in January.",
      "“They need somebody who gets about the pitch, isn’t afraid to put their foot in, has a drive and energy about him to make a difference all over the pitch.",
      "\"But also somebody who can keep possession of the ball and help them advance up the pitch because at the moment they’re relying very much on Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Ideally they would get somebody like Moises Caicedo who does a bit of everything at Chelsea...\"",
      "Thomas Zilliacus has outlined his transfer plans as he prepares to approach investors ahead of a potential bid for Manchester United.",
      "\"That should be the backbone of the team. Then you can have a few experienced guys in the gel as well. I think it's always good to have a mix because the more mature guys, the more experienced guys, they also know how to act when things don't go well.\"",
      "Zilliacus added: \"Look at PSG. Ousmane Dembele is such a perfect example. Barcelona were pretty happy to see him go. Now he's got the Ballon d'Or and he's the star player in a team where he is allowed to play the way he should.",
      "\"But I also think the manager has managed to get him to understand that if he wants to be a star, he has to work. And now he's doing it...\"",
      "According to German outlet Bild, United are monitoring Jobe Bellingham's situation at Borussia Dortmund. The 20-year-old midfielder left Sunderland to join the German outfit in the summer for £27m, plus £4.2m in add-ons.",
      "The report claims that the Reds showed an interest in Bellingham before Dortmund secured his signature. The England Under-21 international has struggled to force himself into Niko Kovač’s side, having made just two starts in the Bundesliga so far this season.",
      "United will have to qualify for the Champions League just to stand a chance of signing Adam Wharton. Speaking on talkSPORT, Steve Parish revealed the midfielder's desire to play on the European stage.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" said the Crystal Palace chairman.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get.",
      "\"I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from...\"",
      "This weekend, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. While the reigning Premier League may fancy their chances, United have recently shown signs of promise..."

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "But Mainoo's continued England exile is a measure of just how far he has fallen since scoring and starring in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City last year and starting that 2-1 defeat for the Three Lions in Berlin's Olympic Stadium seven weeks later.",
      "While some of United's players not representing their countries have taken the time off for some rest and recuperation, escaping to the sun before reporting back for duty tomorrow, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "Mainoo has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting to his 3.3million followers on Instagram pictures and videos of himself working out and pushing himself to the limit.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Ruben Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But the brutal reality for Mainoo seems to be that however many posts he uploads of himself working on his fitness, he is simply not trusted by Amorim to start a game, and with fixtures in short supply given United's failure to qualify for Europe and EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby, his exile is likely to continue.",
      "Against that backdrop, it will come as little surprise if Mainoo makes a fresh request to go out on loan in the January transfer window, by which time the World Cup will be just six months away, with time running out for the 20-year-old to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Tuchel's reluctance to pick Mainoo, despite the midfielder's undeniable talent, is understandable, for he cannot select players who are not playing regularly for their clubs, despite past exploits for England. Therein lies the problem for Mainoo – he has become an outcast for club and country, his career in limbo while Amorim remains in charge and refuses to trust him to start a game.",
      "The only solution to Mainoo's plight is Amorim leaving or United allowing him to leave on loan in the new year. Neither scenario seems likely, given Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent insistence that Amorim needs time and United's previous decision to turn down Mainoo's loan request.",
      "In that sense, there seems to be no escape for Mainoo from his current predicament, a bleak situation for such a bright talent.",

      "Manchester United pair Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbuemo are sweating on places at next summer's World Cup.",
      "The pair, two of United's headline signings this summer at a cost of more than £120million, were on international duty for Slovenia and Cameroon respectively this month.",
      "And in a week where plenty of sides booked their place in next summer's tournament in North America, the wait for Sesko and Mbeumo goes on.",
      "The latter played 90 minutes for Cameroon in a 0-0 draw with Angola on Monday that meant Cape Verde beat them to the automatic qualification spot. The Indomitable Lions are now set to enter the play-offs which will mean Mbeumo and Co having to win four matches to book their place in next summer's showpiece.",
      "For Sesko and Slovenia, a pair of 0-0 draws over the past week against Switzerland and Kosovo means they are third in their qualification group, four points behind Kosovo in second. Switzerland are set to win the group and take the automatic qualifying spot and Slovenia need two wins from their final two matches to have any hope of overhauling Kosovo and securing second place and a shot at the play-offs.",
      "The two United players are not the only high profile Premier League stars in danger of missing the World Cup. Sweden are bottom of Slovenia's group with just one point from four matches and would need an incredible run of results to earn a play-off place, meaning Liverpool's £125million signing Alexander Isak and Arsenal's £75million striker Viktor Gyokeres are set to miss out.",
      "Italy are another potential big-name casualty with the Azzurri playing catch up to Norway in their qualifying group and facing the play-offs to try and avoid missing out on a third successive World Cup.",
      "That quintet of players set top flight clubs back around £325million this summer, yet all five could be absent from football's biggest tournament come June.",

      "Benjamin Sesko’s hopes of a reboot during the international break didn’t come to fruition after he was spotted looking “lonely.”",
      "After a tough start to his Manchester United career, the summer signing went into the break from Premier League action on a high with goals in a losing effort against Brentford and during the crucial victory over Sunderland. He will have been hoping to build on that momentum in Slovenia’s World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Switzerland.",
      "However, goalless draws in both games have left his country’s hopes of qualifying for next year’s tournament hanging by a thread. The Slovenian media appeared to sympathise with Sesko after the game, suggesting he lacked both service and support against the Swiss.",
      "As Ekipa gave him a 6.5/10 rating, the outlet bizarrely referenced American rapper Akon and his hit song Lonely. It said: “We don’t know, maybe he was singing that 20-year-old Akon hit - Lonely. He was too lonely for most of the game, sending the only chance into the outside of the net.”",
      "His manager, Matjaz Kek, wasn’t as understanding, though, saying his attacking players “don’t have bloodlust” after failing to muster a single shot on target against Switzerland, which is not what Ruben Amorim will have wanted to hear about one of his expensive signings.",
      "The Swiss are on course to qualify automatically as group winners, three points clear of Kosovo in second, which would secure a play-off spot. Slovenia are four points further back in third with just two group matches remaining. Slovenia must beat Kosovo in their penultimate group game on November 15 to keep their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup alive.",
      "Until then, Sesko will be focused on United and Sunday’s game at tottering Liverpool. An impending trip to Anfield has been dreaded by United fans in recent times, but the champions appear vulnerable after suffering back-to-back Premier League defeats to Crystal Palace and Chelsea.",
      "Of course, United have frailties of their own, but the nature of the victory over Sunderland offered cautious promise, even if Amorim was refusing to get carried away.",
      "“I know they want to do their best – and I know they don’t want to change the coach all the time,” he said after that game. “But to be with the manager is, ‘I will kill myself to go in every transition.’ We need to show with actions.",
      "“And sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end, they know that sometimes we can do better. So, I feel that during the week but we need to show that on the pitch, not just at home but also away.”",

      "Joshua Zirkzee had the potential to become a Manchester United cult hero after overcoming adversity.",
      "Zirkzee dealt with the embarrassment of being hooked against Newcastle after 33 minutes last December and showed tremendous character in bouncing back over the subsequent weeks.",
      "The Dutchman was an entertaining watch after being switched to one of the No.10 roles. Zirkzee was signed to play as a striker, but it was obvious that he did not possess the skillset to lead the United attack.",
      "United fans rooted for Zirkzee to come good after the Newcastle substitution, although he was demoted in the squad this summer when Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arrived.",
      "Zirkzee has found opportunities hard to come by this term. Mbeumo and Cunha have been the first choice picks in the No.10 roles, while Mason Mount, Amad and Bruno Fernandes can also play there.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not started Zirkzee once, even naming him on the bench against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round. United have fewer fixtures this term and Zirkzee's chances of playing have been damaged by the early Carabao Cup exit and the failure to qualify for European football.",
      "He has recorded just 82 minutes across four appearances from the bench against Grimsby, Burnley, Manchester City and Brentford, but his current situation is not a surprise.",
      "It was predictable that Zirkzee would slip down the pecking order and become a peripheral squad member, given United's summer signings and failure to qualify for Europe.",
      "The extent of Zirkzee's demotion might be a tad surprising, though. He made positive contributions from the bench last season, but he's practically been forgotten about just months into the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Zirkzee will be concerned about his lack of involvement and it's not a surprise that reports linking him with a move away from Old Trafford in the January transfer window.",
      "The forward is aware that he must play to have a chance of making the Netherlands squad for the 2026 World Cup. Zirkzee has no chance of making Ronaldo Koeman's squad if he stays in Manchester.",
      "West Ham have been linked with a move for the Dutchman, while a return to Italy to represent Roma has also been touted, and an offer from the latter would be more attractive to the player.",
      "Zirkzee impressed during his time with Bologna in Serie A and only needs to look to his former teammate, Rasmus Hojlund, to decide why a return to Italy might be the best move for him.",
      "Hojlund has enjoyed a new lease of life since joining Napoli on transfer deadline day, scoring four goals in six appearances.",
      "The problem for Zirkzee is that although a move away in January makes perfect sense for him, does it make sense for United? He might not have started a game but he is seen as an important squad member.",
      "United are a stroke of bad luck away from needing Zirkzee and Amorim will want to keep him for the remainder of the campaign, which could end his chances of playing at the World Cup.",
      "There could be a standoff between both parties in January and it will be fascinating to see how it develops, as United pay Zirkzee's wages and ultimately have the power in discussions.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation to Kobbie Mainoo, who is desperate to play at the World Cup for England next summer. Clubs must dread a World Cup season because players are more likely to rock the boat in an attempt to secure a move for the sake of regular minutes.",
      "It's understandable that Zirkzee and Mainoo could request to leave for the sake of game time. Whether those requests will be entertained is another matter.",
      "United must be sympathetic to their situations, while also prioritising the club's interests.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes Sir Jim Ratcliffe was wrong to compare Ruben Amorim to Mikel Arteta. Speaking recently on a podcast, the Manchester United co-owner revealed that he plans to honour his head coach's contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe insisted that Amorim will be given time to transform the club's fortunes, despite a rocky start to the season. In a staunch defence of the Portuguese tactician, the British billionaire referenced Mikel Arteta's teething stage when he replaced Unai Emery at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Ferdinand commended Ratcliffe for being so open. The United legend said: \"You know what, I just like to hear the people that are in the driving seat of a football club come out and speak.",
      "\"That's what I like about Jim Ratcliffe. I think he obviously went on to a podcast to speak about something totally different, but obviously, that podcast isn't going to allow him to come on and not ask him about Man United.",
      "\"So, it's just refreshing that somebody in his position actually talks,\" added Ferdinand before digging Ratcliffe out for his comments about Arteta. \"Now, do I agree exactly with what he said?",
      "\"I understand the sentiment– if you go through the facts, I don't think it's the right person to draw a comparison with. You look at Arteta – there are similarities in some of the stats.",
      "\"The big one is that he improved the team from 10th to finish eighth in his first year. Amorim took his team from 14th to finish 15th. There was also flexibility in the way Arteta had his team.",
      "\"I think he had about seven different formations in his first 50 matches, just trying things out. The improvement line would have been a bit more consistent, and you go, 'I can see it happening'.",
      "\"Whereas with Amorim, you look at him and there isn't as much consistency or positives that are coming out of it that you're going, 'oh, I can actually see it clearly, it's hitting me between my eyes, I couldn't let this guy go'.",
      "\"I think right now, we're at a stage with United and Amorim, [where] I just want to see that consistency of some results coming through, performance alongside that, and an idea that you go, 'oh, I can see this training ground stuff really paying off'.",
      "\"The consistency with all of those three different elements isn't there right now, and I'm hoping he can get that right.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Ferdinand was, of course, referencing comments made by Ratcliffe on the 'The Business podcast'. At the start of the international break, the INEOS boss claimed that he remains in control of football operations at the club.",
      "When asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe, who has owned just under 30 per cent of United since February 2024, said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "He added: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond. That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United.",
      "\"We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rep... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Noting his long-term plan, the 72-year-old said: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Asked if he'll honour the United boss' contract, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years.",
      "\"You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week...\"",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko is facing the prospect of not playing at next summer's World Cup.",
      "Slovenia drew 0-0 with Switzerland in a World Cup qualifier on Monday night, meaning they sit third in Group B. Switzerland occupies the top spot in the group and Kosovo are second.",
      "Switzerland have 10 points and are expected to win the group when the remaining two qualifying fixtures are played next month. Kosovo have seven points and Slovenia three. They have to play each other during the November international break, which will have an impact on who advances to the play-offs.",
      "Slovenia played out two goalless draws against Kosovo and Switzerland this month. They face Kosovo at home and Sweden away next month to decide their fate in Group B.",
      "Sesko played 90 minutes in both of Slovenia's matches during the October international break, but the 22-year-old was unable to find the net after breaking his duck for United with two goals in his last two games.",
      "Slovenia manager, Matjaz Kek, criticised his side's failure to score in both games, saying after the Switzerland draw: \"A realistic result in a difficult and very dynamic, competitive match with quite a few mistakes on both sides.",
      "\"But when you hear about the result of the second match, you realise what we lost in the second half of the match in Kosovo. It bothers me that we didn't score a goal in three qualifying matches.",
      "\"We had chances throughout the game, but the last pass was not precise enough. There is no victory without a goal, despite our great desire, we went a long way, we were tactically well positioned.",
      "\"Right now I'm only thinking about the next match. First of all, we have to do our job, enough thinking about what we should do or what someone else is doing. This team was at a high level in terms of approach, but we lack a little determination in the last 30 meters before the goal.\"",
      "Speaking after the 0-0 against Kosovo, Kek said: “We had our opponent under control in a way we haven’t had any for a long time, but I am missing a bit more of a killer instinct in the penalty area.\"",
      "Slovenia have only appeared at the World Cup twice - in 2002 and 2010 - being eliminated in the group stage on both occasions. Switzerland and Sweden were the favourites to progress from Group B.",
      "Sesko got off to a slow start in Manchester after signing from German side RB Leipzig, but he followed his first goal for United against Brentford with another against Sunderland.",
      "Speaking after Sunderland, Sesko was asked whether fans have seen the best of him and responded: \"No, not yet. There's loads to come. I'm still getting used to it more and more to read the players, to be connected with them even more. I believe I can be even better and I will try to show that.\"",

      "Wharton has emerged as one of Europe's finest midfield prospects over the last two seasons. The 21-year-old has delivered superb performances in defensive midfield for Crystal Palace, and starred in his side's FA Cup victory against Manchester City at Wembley last season.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",

      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",

      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko made it 2-0 shortly after the half hour mark as he grabbed his second goal in a week.",
      "Sunderland were awarded a penalty before the half-time break but the decision was overturned by referee Stuart Attwell after he’d been advised by VAR to head over to the pitchside monitor.",

      "Here’s all the reaction from today’s game:",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",

      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",

      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "There’s nothing quite like an international break when it comes to Premier League players giving revealing interviews.",
      "Matheus Cunha has become the latest to wait until he is back home to say how he really feels, falling into the Romelu Lukaku trap of forgetting that translators exist so every word he says will be picked up and analysed back on British shores.",
      "While on international duty, Cunha gave a sit-down interview with Globo Esporte, one of his home country’s biggest sports programmes. In a 15-minute conversation, the Brazilian spoke of playing for his national team, of his new manager Carlo Ancelotti and of course Manchester United.",
      "It’s not quite Cristiano Ronaldo levels of s**ting on your own doorstep but Cunha was perhaps a little more revealing than he meant to be. After two months, Cunha admitted he felt like he had been at United for a lot longer because “of the club’s current situation”. He spoke of the pressure he felt to start getting results as quickly as possible because he is “a big signing”. At one point he even referred to himself in the third person.",
      "Cunha’s interview revealed that the catastrophic aura surrounding the club from fans and pundits is seeping through to the players. If Fergie’s United used to give players an air of invincibility, Amorim – and those who came before him – seem to instill a sense of crisis.",
      "With one billion fans across the world, the biggest challenge for any player moving to United is the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with that. Usually a manager’s job would be to protect players but when he himself is facing daily questions about his tenure, it is understandable that the players get caught in the crossfire.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Man Utd ‘lurk’ for winter Bellingham move with Dortmund drama to get ‘more explosive’\n👉 Man Utd told ‘lazy’ player will cost them against Liverpool unless Slot does one thing\n👉 Man Utd legends ‘approached’ by UAE-based consortium as Glazers set out terms for deal",
      "That environment is hardly conducive to success and there is a growing list of players who leave and begin playing like they aren’t carrying an Indiana Jones-style boulder on their back. Scott McTominay has become a deity in Naples. Antony looked a lot more like an £86million footballer at Betis than he did at United. Marcus Rashford seems to have remembered that football can be quite fun and not a massive burden now that he is in Barcelona. Even Rasmus Hojlund looks like a striker.",
      "Joining United has become one of the smarter career moves if only for the immediate boost you get on exit and it is easy to see a scenario where Cunha becomes another example,",
      "The Brazilian is undoubtedly talented and undeniably kept Wolves in the Premier League last season, but he has been signed to a system where he has no obvious place.",
      "At Wolves, the team was built around him, allowing him to line up on the team sheet as a centre-forward but not really play like one. In Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, there is no obvious space to do that.",
      "The Portuguese boss is not the first manager to fall in love with Mason Mount, which means his starting spot is pretty much locked down. Benjamin Sesko has scored twice since he started leading the line and Bryan Mbeumo is more suited to a wide-right role than Cunha.",
      "Cunha may well be a £62.5million signing that has no obvious place in the team. The player himself commented on this, bringing up his youth spell as a midfielder before 4-3-3 took over the game and he suddenly had to become a number nine.",
      "“I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number 9 shirt,” Cunha said.",
      "“I played my entire base as a midfielder, and when I became a professional, I encountered the world of 4-3-3. You have to adapt: either play centre-forward, winger, or ‘eight’.",
      "“They eliminated the midfielder position, and you have to adapt.",
      "“But I see it positively, as it has given me experience, many more positions, and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team.",
      "“Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.”",
      "While it’s true that versatility is a positive trait, it can also make it hard to nail down a position. Amorim began the season with Cunha as the centre forward but pulled him deeper after the signing of Sesko, and there is every chance that for United’s next game away at Liverpool, Cunha is again on the bench as he was for the win over Sunderland.",
      "Cunha started up front for Brazil in the first game of this international break and although he did not score, he did provide an assist. After his time with Brazil is over, he heads back to the doom and gloom of United and if it feels like a long time after two months, just imagine how long it will feel come the end of a most likely underwhelming season.",

      "Alalshikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",

      "It was confirmed on Monday that the potential investors are a UAE-based consortium who are ‘very serious’ about buying Man Utd from the Glazers.",
      "And confirming interest from the UAE, Ben Jacobs and Alex Crook wrote on talkSPORT that the Glazers ‘still value Manchester United in excess of £5billion amid rumours of a potential Middle Eastern takeover’.",

      "Borson added: “It just seems to me that it would be quite odd timing, and given how thorough the process was before that didn’t flush out this kind of proposal, why now when things are worse would somebody be prepared to pay more?",
      "“It’s a harder deal to do now than it was two years ago, so why would that make sense now? The economic picture is not as good. They’ve got the stadium situation. You’ve got Jim Ratcliffe in the way.",

      "But mostly the Mailbox is intent on telling us how terrible Football365 is.",
      "Maybe watch England tonight (yes, really) and send your thoughts to theeeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Well that’s me told, I guess IATA. Long suspected as much.\nAidan, Lfc (in response to Mark, mate turned up 5 mins after kick off and wife 25, I stood until guy left at half time)",

      "As a riposte to Ian, and a counterpoint for you George, no, 3-4-3/5-3-2 won’t be a good (or really great, which should be the target) formation for United, unless you have a very limited view of what you want United to be able to do.",
      "There’s countless good videos and articles on this (Athletic, Coaches Voice etc) but with an oversimplification, any formation that emphasises 3 at the back and two wingbacks is really a better out-of-possession than in-possession style team. If you want your team to be a smart counter-puncher prioritising quick turnovers and attacks, then it can be good, if you tailor your squad to that specific tactic. Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace are the best current incarnation of this.",
      "What this formation doesn’t give you however is an abundance of on-ball creation/high possession – in effect you sacrifice some midfield creativity to get that extra CB in, and in many cases, you now rely on your WBs to either provide the crucial width, or sometimes be the ones popping up in the half spaces in front of the boxes. Now they could be quite creative in their own right (Frimpong at Bayer) but they’re still not true attacking players, so when facing a set defence, they’re unlikely to offer the attacking threat of a dedicated winger/forward – they need to be in a mismatch situation.",
      "There are two notable exceptions – Conte’s Chelsea and Alonso’s Bayer – but both of those were a) one off seasons exploiting unique situations and b) successfully countered by the following season/underwent serious regression.",
      "Assuming you want United to dominate in a similar vein to the most successful teams of the last 30 years in the PL, you want to be consistently controlling possession, having the best attacking talent getting space in dangerous areas and generating high value chances whilst limiting them at the back. Even with the slight shift towards increased verticality in the PL this season, the better teams are clearly still prioritising controlling the midfield with men and quality.",
      "Now, clearly if you have flexibility within your formation (ultimately what made Alonso’s Bayer work was the sheer unpredictability of where any given player would be with their great passing interchanges) that can overcome some of these problems, but what makes Amorim such a poor coach (at this point) is both his formational AND tactical rigidity – he doesn’t just play the same structure, but within that structure plays the same way, making him exceptionally predictable.",
      "There are other elements (smaller pool of specialists that excel at these formations means less talent at a higher price point available to purchase) which IMO prevent 3-4-3 from establishing itself fully, but yeah in essence, more good attacking players having the ball often, and in better areas really should be United’s modus operandi, and 3-4-3 ain’t that.\nTom (also, Ian, that Liverpool team were… not that good) Leyton",

That total is only 5 less than Rashford had scored by the same age. It’s very solid!",
      "Truth is, Arsenal were pretty much inconsequential to the point; the prompt not the subject.",
      "More apropos, I remain amazed that Liverpool didn’t have a higher scoring top scorer considering their 80s dominance but I guess too many Scots and Welsh. And while United have a couple of good entries, really Rooney is an Everton success (we didn’t make him great, just gave him the platform), just as Sterling was at City and Lampard at Chelsea.",

A commitment to disingenuousness is the trap f365 now needs to navigate.",

Because national pride has long-since been sneered at by The Left. And now the scramble of both own and disown the Union Flag is underway. The only way to own the flag from The Right is to invoke a sense of national pride. Not to call people Gammons. Take it back again and learn from the failed strategy of steering and snide sniping.",
      "To disagree is some of any part of either sides position does not make them a lefty looney or a gammon. I have to admit I don’t like the word gammon. To refer to someone as a pig due to the colour of their skin x their political leanings seems a bit off. Seems a bit smug. Represents those left wing traits that see it fail and see the Farages of this world fill the gap.",
      "Then on to the ‘what happens when England fans stop being bored?’ column. Firstly, have you been to college football? It’s carnage. Utter mayhem. There is excessive drinking, property damage, fisticuffs. The whole experience. It would come as no surprise to any American that bedlam pursues sporting events like lies to a columnist. None of this touched upon. Similarly, the isolation of such troubles to England fans is a wilful misrepresentation of the reality. As things stand, football trouble is rife all over the world, from the stabby streets of Rome to the riotous banlieu of Paris. Let’s not touch on South American rivalry or Eastern Europeans training in combat before games. England fans are enriched by some real scummers for home Danny Dyer is keeping the old value alive. But football games around the world, at both national and club level, is a violent affair.",
      "Maybe there is some sense of shame to seeing England fans act like hooligans has merit. I equally shudder when European games feature monkey chants, often at their own players. Maybe it’s time to step away from football altogether.",
      "All of this lack of nuance is peak Guardian who see what they want to see so long as their narrative is supported. (And if f365’s stance was equally as disingenuous to a right wing stance I’d be calling you all out on being the Fox News/Daily Mail of football sites).",

      "Murphy told BetWright: “I think Sir Jim Ratcliffe got cornered a bit and wasn’t especially well prepared for the interview where he talked about giving Ruben Amorim three years to turn things around at Manchester United. I don’t think he should have said that and it’s inevitably going to come back to bite him.",
      "“If United lose their next three or four games, the pressure from the fans will get too much and the board will have no choice but to sack Amorim.",
      "“Ratcliffe would have been better off saying that the board are backing the manager and that they’re being patient, whilst recognising that it isn’t going to be the easiest of tasks – but it would at least show that they are right behind him.",
      "“The reality is you can’t make any guarantees in football. You could argue that with Liverpool winning the league in Arne Slot’s first season at the club – you can’t make a guarantee that he will be there in three years and they’re flying.",

      "Man Utd don’t have any European competition to concentrate on this term and they have already been knocked out of the League Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Their defeat to Grimsby was Mainoo’s only start in all competitions this season with his other five appearances coming off the bench in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim frustrated the Man Utd hierarchy when he publicly admitted that Mainoo was fighting captain Bruno Fernandes for a place in the starting XI this season.",

      "Nicol told ESPN: “In my opinion, Mainoo is great with the ball at his feet but when the opposition has the ball, he doesn’t do enough.",
      "“In fact, he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t stop people getting at Man Utd back four. And the fact that that is one of the biggest problems United have and this guy still can’t figure it out.",
      "“I think basically he’s been found out because at the end of the day, when you play for the top clubs and you want to be challenging, your players have to contribute on both sides of the ball.",
      "“And if there is one thing Mainoo doesn’t do, it’s contribute defensively.",
      "“The fact that Casemiro is starting over him consistently tells you that there is a problem and the kid is not as good as we thought he was when he first burst onto the scene.”",
      "When asked if Amorim could help Mainoo improve those aspects of his game, Nicol added: “It’s interesting you say work with him, because it looks like the work rate on that side isn’t there.",
      "“Any coach who has a player who he thinks isn’t giving their all, when it comes to having to play one guy or another, that guy is getting shoved away.",
      "“If you’re the coach at United and you’re watching Mainoo time after time letting people run off them and looking as though you are not that bothered about it, you’re going to the bottom of the pile.”",
      "Speaking of Mainoo last month, Man Utd boss Amorim said: “Like a lot of guys, he wants to play more.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot.",
      "“And sometimes I think for some guys it’s [the level he’s playing at now] enough. For him, it’s not enough. Maybe it’s not fair but I think I’m helping Kobbie Mainoo and that’s it.",
      "“He will have opportunities like the other guys. If I feel during the week that he’s the best player to play, he’s going to play and I proved that already to every player here.",

      "Nothing like an October international break in which England don’t even play a competitive game until the very last moment to leave you pondering choices. Your own, mainly, but also those of football clubs.",
      "Relentlessly silly, frequently stupid football clubs. The regrets. The f*ck-ups. Call them what you will, but here’s just 10 things Premier League clubs might now wish worked out differently.",
      "Some are entirely self-inflicted f*cktastrophes, some are unfortunate circumstance, and the rest some combination of the two.",
      "And then there’s Nottingham Forest, who are currently just some kind of insane f*ck-around-and-f*nd-out machine to the extent we’re not even sure regret has taken hold yet.",
      "",
      "There really is no other word for it. It’s the only word that adequately explains and conveys Nottingham Forest’s behaviour since about halfway through last season. This is a club that got dangerously high on the smell of their own farts and may now pay a ludicrously heavy price.",
      "They were very, very good at what they did last season under Nuno Espirito Santo. There was perhaps no other team in the league with a more clear-headed gameplan, delivered to consistent effect by a squad of players perfectly suited to the task.",
      "Even then, there were occasional glimpses. Occasional momentary lapses where Forest tried to be something different – something more? Something better? – than what had worked so well for them.",
      "There was one particular game against Newcastle, in which Forest had played their usual counter-attacking game to fine effect to lead 1-0 at half-time. Yet in the second they tried to play front-foot football that was not and is not their way and were picked off with ease by a grateful Newcastle, who ran out comfy 3-1 winners.",
      "That one match is now starting to look like a microcosm of these two seasons. The success in the first half has led them to a state of not-yet-earned giddiness and, yes, hubris.",
      "There is an arrogance for any club outside the cosseted elite to assume that their hard-won Premier League status is now entirely secure. The casual manner in which Forest allowed the Nuno situation to develop into an irreparable rift was extremely careless and far more risky than anyone from excitable owner down appeared to accept or even realise.",
      "And quite simply no Premier League team that is even dimly aware of the fact that relegation remains a theoretical possible fate would then bring Ange Postecoglou along into a season that has already begun, less still into a squad so unsuited to his wildly different methods.",
      "And no Premier League team thinking about anything but relegation is even looking at the Dyche button a few weeks later. That sound you can hear is a penny dropping far too late.",
      "A chaotic and potentially ruinous six-week misadventure that may now end with Forest right back with the sort of manager they had before, just a less good one. All while ensuring there is now absolutely no chance of Postecoglou’s undeniably entertaining nonsense ever featuring in Our League again. Cheers, lads.",

      "We’re not saying it was a bad idea to sign Alexander Isak or that he is anything other than a brilliant player. Even if someone mischievously puts that in the headline, which they might, the pricks.",
      "We’re just saying that signing Alexander Isak might not have been Liverpool’s best use of valuable time and resources as the final hours of the transfer window drained away.",
      "It is still very funny that by the time Liverpool actually got round to completing that Isak move they had already long before that signed Newcastle’s preferred replacement in Hugo Ekitike. But as more time passes, the more it looks like that joke is on Liverpool every bit as much as it was on Newcastle.",
      "Isak was the ultimate luxury signing. Not a player Liverpool needed, but one they could have. But by the time he came through the door Liverpool had already signed Ekitike and Florian Wirtz.",
      "Sure, Liverpool’s attack is stronger with Isak than without and it’s a long season with deep squads needed and all the rest.",
      "But by the time Liverpool were toing and froing to get that deal done it was far, far more necessary to perform some more prosaic but necessary remedial work in the defence.",
      "Sure, the extent of Ibrahima Konate’s struggles might have been hard to predict, but relying entirely on him and Virgil van Dijk – who is older than new Luton manager Jack Wilshere – was always a risk that didn’t need taking.",
      "Marc Guehi was right there. He was up for it, and so too were Palace until Liverpool turned such a fundamental transfer – Guehi wasn’t even a back-up, he’d have been straight in for Konate – into so much of an afterthought that Palace had no time left to get their own Guehi-less squad straight and thus pulled the plug.",
      "It is, obviously, not a straightforward either/or situation. Clubs can and obviously do work on multiple deals at once. But it’s hard to shake the notion that completing the more ostentatious and headline-grabbing deal left Liverpool with their eyes off the less exciting but more necessary prize. It’s a rare mis-step, but a potentially costly one.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe continues to paint himself into a distinctly difficult corner over his at-all-costs backing of Ruben Amorim. Maybe he’s right. Maybe it will eventually all come good. But that looks a massive odds-against gamble right now.",
      "Ratcliffe has doubled-down harder than ever with his ‘three years’ daftness, a quote that has a small chance of becoming his ‘I always win something in my second season’ and a very, very high chance of either becoming yet another point of United ridicule or further hindrance to taking a necessary step.",
      "Almost impossible now to believe that anything more than the stubborn refusal of Ratcliffe and INEOS to accept the embarrassing fact of their own error is keeping Amorim in the job, and that really is just a double victory for silliness.",
      "Just own it. Face up to it. It’s not like Forest appointing Postecoglou, is it? It’s not like sacking Erik Ten Hag and appointing Amorim was an obvious mistake literally the world could see from a mile away. Really, the only quibble people could reasonably have with appointing Amorim when United appointed one of the most impressive young coaches in Europe was why had they dallied in the summer rather than make the change then?",
      "Nobody seriously imagined the Amorim Era would be this bad. Lots of people, and we’ll put ourselves in this camp, thought it might be really quite good.",
      "But it isn’t. It’s really sh*t. And the damage in sticking with Amorim is already being done. United have already lost Marcus Rashford for what will ultimately prove to be a pittance, so in thrall are they to Amorim and not wanting to be embarrassed. They might well lose Kobbie Mainoo next.",
      "And nothing in his record at the club suggests he’s worth it. And the comparisons with Mikel Arteta’s early years at Arsenal just don’t hold water. Arteta came under serious pressure and rightly so; he could very easily have been sacked. But he never had Arsenal in anything like the dire straits that have become the new normal at too-big-to-succeed Man United.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest’s loss may now prove West Ham’s gain, and at the very least you’d expect Nuno Espirito Santo to get the Hammers playing halfway competent and broadly effective football that keeps them away from relegation unpleasantness.",
      "But they had that. With David Moyes. And they didn’t want that anymore, because they wanted to aim higher and dream bigger. Which is absolutely fine. For what it’s worth, we once again thought similarly. It probably was time for Moyes to move on and West Ham to see what they might be able to do with a more progressive front-foot manager.",
      "But then they appointed Julen Lopetegui, who is the Spanish David Moyes.",
      "When that didn’t work they finally took a more West Ham approach and went for Graham Potter. And then gave him absolutely nothing of what he needed in the summer.",
      "Throughout the struggles in the final weeks and months of last season, it was clear that Potter could not be fairly judged until he’d had a pre-season to get his ideas across, and ideally a few players to help make that transition.",
      "Potter himself is far from blameless. He may well not have succeeded even if given the conditions to do so. But now we’ll never know, because West Ham didn’t just fail to do what was needed during the summer; for large parts of it they didn’t even particularly seem to be trying.",
      "",
      "It may only be slightly exaggerating things to say that Leeds’ entire season on their return to the Premier League may come to be defined by the period between Daniel Farke responding to a creditable 0-0 draw against Newcastle on August 30 by asking for two new attacking players, and the window closing with Leeds bringing in no new attacking players.",
      "The frustration is two-fold. First, because Farke’s request was not unreasonable. This was not a moon-on-a-stick request. He was asking for Harry Wilson and Manor Solomon, not Lamine Yamal and Vini Jr.",
      "Two, Farke’s Leeds had already by then shown proof of concept. They had shown against both Everton and Newcastle that they were capable enough defensively of mounting a serious bid for survival, but were hampered by attacking inadequacies that had seen them manage just one goal in three games – and that a penalty.",
      "While there have been more goals since the closing of the window, with six in their most four Premier League games, three of those came at Wolves. And right now we’re inclined to consider those as roughly as irrelevant to any assessment of Leeds’ long-term survival prospects as conceding five goals at Arsenal.",
      "Leeds definitely still have a decent shot at staying up in a league that offers more opportunity to do so for a competent promoted team than at any other time in the last few years. But it really wouldn’t have taken a lot of activity in those last few days to make that decent shot a truly compelling one.",
      "",
      "We’ve already stretched the concept of ‘this season’ right back to include the entirety of the transfer window that precedes it, and that feels like it’s absolutely fair enough. The transfer window is surely part of the season that follows it far more than it is part of the season that preceded it.",
      "It is upon that following season that its influence is felt. But can we really claim things that happened in May during last season as being this season’s regrets and/or f*ck-ups.",
      "When it comes to Wolves, we’re saying yes. Yes we can. Our reasons are these.",
      "First of all, May is very much a month when cricket is played and is therefore summer. That’s just basic. Second, that very deliberate phrase we used just now about the transfer window: it is upon that following season that its influence is felt.",
      "And that’s exactly how we feel about the last four matches of Wolves’ 24/25 season. They meant absolutely nothing to 2024/25, Wolves having already secured survival with something to spare by winning six games in a row through March and April.",
      "But their influence on 25/26 already feels far more significant. Because this is very familiar Wolves territory: a bad end to one season bleeding into a bad start to the next.",
      "That winning run – albeit against three terrible relegated sides and the other three most ridiculous and feeble Premier League teams at that time in West Ham, Spurs and Man United – offered Wolves the chance to avoid that familiar end-of-season sinking feeling.",
      "They weren’t easy games in that final four, but we’re not asking for them to make that winning run 10 games or anything. Lose to Man City by all means if you really must, but even just a home win against either Brighton or Brentford would have taken Wolves into summer with some wind in their sails.",
      "It might not have been enough. The loss of key players would still have been keenly felt, but the bleak nature of their start, one that leaves them now as the only Premier League team still without a win having declined a Dr Tottenham prescription at the last moment, would have felt far less inevitably self-fulfilling.",
      "",
      "Breaking our own rules a bit here by treating Chelsea as a club where regrets and f*ck-ups are measured in the same way by the same metrics as football clubs, rather than what Chelsea now are.",
      "When correctly treated as a football player trading company, selling Noni Madueke made a fair chunk of sense. He was far from indispensable and even Arsenal’s fans didn’t particularly want him at the time.",
      "But Chelsea have often looked a weary side since their Club World Cup win and, with several attacking players currently underperforming and relying more and more on the increased goal contributions of Moises Caicedo, it might have been nice to keep Madueke around the place.",
      "And that’s before even considering the whole ‘strengthening a direct rival’ angle, one that allowed Arsenal to achieve what was previously thought impossible: suffer a minor Bukayo Saka injury setback without doom-laden proclamations about the sky falling in from long-suffering fans of the only club to ever suffer injuries.",
      "",
      "Not going badly for Spurs at all, really, all things considered, and this one is definitely far more in the ‘slightly irritating’ category than a lot of others on the list.",
      "They did some tidy transfer work in the end this summer, albeit with a couple of cartoonish bits of Spursy slapstick along the way, and so far the idea of replacing Ange Postecoglou’s ludicrous football with Thomas Frank’s not ludicrous football is proving an effective if not always necessarily exhilarating decision.",
      "Where Tottenham might have slightly missed the boat is behind the scenes. In hindsight, we perhaps should have seen Daniel Levy’s departure coming. There was a clear sense this summer of a man attempting to cement his legacy, most notably when even agreeing to sit down for a chat with dangerous far-left Commie firebrand Gary Neville.",
      "But he didn’t actually leave until after the transfer window. And the Lewis Family’s new-found interest in the day-to-day running of Spurs and injection of £100m of fresh capital has also come now specifically at a time when it cannot actually be used to better the on-field situation.",
      "And this is suddenly a season ripe with opportunities for Spurs. Arsenal look too good but are still Arsenal; Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City all look more vulnerable to some extent or other than had been expected, Manchester United are still in full clown-car more, Nottingham Forest have collapsed in on themselves, while neither Aston Villa nor Newcastle appear in quite as good a position to challenge as in the recent past.",
      "The margins between success (i.e. getting back in the Champions League) and failure (not doing that) are likely to be very tight again this season. A chairman who hadn’t actively antagonised every other club in the division and an extra £100m to throw around really might have meant more in August than it does in October. Or even January when it may be too late and, of course, Value Is Hard To Come By.",

      "It feels like Villa spent the entire summer in something of a funk on the back of missing out on Champions League football in the manner that they did and the knock-on effect that had on what they could do and who they could bring in during the summer.",
      "The good news is that there really is a very good chance that, like with Spurs last season, it all ends up working out for the best and they get back in the Champions League anyway with a lovely shiny European trophy ending an uncomfortably long drought.",
      "But right now, despite a four-game winning run that has lifted the gloom and funk to a decent extent, it does look rather more likely that something is ending rather than beginning at Villa, that they will now slink back having so nearly but not quite muscled their way right in to England and thus Europe’s top table.",
      "",
      "Not entirely or even mainly their fault, but Newcastle’s summer was an awkward, distracting and distracted one. In a league where standing still is rarely good enough, theirs was a summer spent inevitably and uncomfortably trying to avoid tumbling backwards.",
      "The uncertainty – or perhaps the long, painfully drawn-out certainty – around Alexander Isak’s departure didn’t help make it any easier for Newcastle to identify and secure a replacement, with those potentially coming in understandably keen to know exactly where they might stand before committing to the club.",
      "They do seem to have just about got there in the end with Nick Woltemade, even if it they had to pay a hefty premium to avoid the catastrophe of bringing in no replacement striker whatsoever. The big German absolutely screams cult hero, but it’s an awful lot to ask for him to come anywhere close to replacing what Isak gave them, and Newcastle weren’t able to even attempt the always entertaining if not perhaps reliably successful ‘Sell Elvis and buy The Beatles’ approach.",

      "The Manchester United takeover machine has left the station again. But have the Glazers finally resolved to cut ties after being hit with a leveraged buyout-shaped guilty conscience two decades in the making? Has Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided he is too old to be willingly dealing with this nonsense? Or is there a mystery third option involving a sort of consortium which ‘can generate billions for the club’ and idolise Ousmane Dembele?",
      "It feels like a good time for a little Q&A session to try and shed some light on precisely what is going on.",
      "Certainly not ostensibly. Ratcliffe’s INEOS only completed the purchase of a 27.7% stake in the club in February 2024 for £1.25billion, increasing that stake to 28.9% in December 2024 when the last payment of a further £238m financial injection to boost the club’s infrastructure was made.",
      "That grants INEOS Limited – owned by Ratcliffe, Andy Currie and Manchester United board director John Reece – 28.9% of outstanding shares and voting rights, plus control over footballing operations, which has been exercised flagrantly and is unlikely to be relinquished soon or easily.",
      "Ratcliffe recently pledged to honour the entirety of Ruben Amorim’s three-year contract; those were not the words, nor have these been the actions, of a man who wishes to sell.",
      "Members of the Glazer family still control 48.9% of total outstanding shares altogether, with 67.9% of voting rights split between the six American siblings.",
      "The Glazers and INEOS are, as the club’s official website puts it, the only ‘two entities [who] hold greater than 10% of the voting rights in Manchester United plc’.",
      "While the changes to that ownership structure have not delivered the success INEOS will have craved or the Glazers perhaps expected, it is vanishingly unlikely either party will want to release their shares and offers are hardly being encouraged either way.",
      "It boils down to a couple of quotes chucked into the void of an international break.",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, a government department charged with developing the entertainment sector in Saudi Arabia, sparked the furore by posting on X:",

      "Then a few days later a familiar name cropped up again in the news cycle: Thomas Zilliacus was back to take any seat at the top table he could find.",
      "Having spent an uncomfortable amount of 2023 arguing with a fellow Manchester United bidder who Ratcliffe later suggested “nobody’s ever seen” and might not actually even “exist”, Zilliacus capitalised on the unexpected commotion to bring his ideas into the equation again.",
      "The Finnish former Nokia head and XXI Century Capital founder teased “joining forces with the right parties with the sole aim of bringing Manchester United back to where it should be as the number one club in the world”.",
      "He felt “the opportunity is still there” to invest, aimed another fan-friendly dig at the Glazers for “not doing what should be done”, said he would “have nothing against working with people like Jim Ratcliffe or any investor, whoever that may be”.",
      "Zilliacus also confessed his love for players like Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele while saying he would “never have brought a player like Neymar to Manchester United” in a definite blast at Ed Woodward.",

      "Manchester United have thus far dismissed the rumours privately to sources when asked; it does seem to be that there actually is a lot of smoke without fire here.",
      "It is impossible to know their intentions but there has been no indication that the Glazers are willing to sell any more of their shares.",
      "There is, however, some interesting fine print contained within the INEOS purchase of a minority stake which remains relevant.",
      "As part of that deal was a ‘drag-along rights’ clause which was scheduled to become active 18 months after the initial investment, lasting until February 2027. The mechanism came into effect in August.",
      "In short, it makes the full sale of a company theoretically easier by preventing a minority shareholder from blocking any deal those who hold the majority want to go through. In this case it means that if the Glazers found someone willing to buy 100% of the shares in Manchester United, Ratcliffe would be forced to sell his stake in the deal.",
      "If that deal is made before February 2027, the share price must be above the $33 Ratcliffe paid. After that, it can be lower.",
      "INEOS also had first refusal on any shares the Glazers wanted to sell, although that expired without needing to be activated in August.",
      "There is a belief within the club that the Glazers are more than happy with the ownership situation, providing as it does a useful lightning rod for criticism in INEOS and Ratcliffe while allowing them to maintain overarching control of an incredibly lucrative investment.",
      "There is one bidder conspicuous by his absence in the current speculation: Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "His takeover bid failed in 2023 when he attempted to buy 100% of shares in Manchester United for £4.79bn but repeatedly failed to provide proof of funds.",
      "Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail has suggested that while Jassim ‘has kept an eye on developments and is aware of the clause, there is ‘zero interest’ in acting upon it’.",
      "A few reasons are cited: Qatar’s desire to focus on other projects such as securing the 2036 Olympics; the success PSG have had making buying another club ‘less attractive because someone else has already been there and done it in Europe’; and the media doubt his interest drew – Jassim was said to have sent ‘legal letters’ to Manchester United and Ratcliffe at the time.",
      "The belief is that Jassim has ‘moved on’ but the Middle East would not be short of prospective buyers if given enough encouragement.",
      "If Manchester United were sold now at the $33-per-share minimum that Ratcliffe is legally entitled to, that would give the club a current valuation of £4.3bn – making them the most expensive football club ever sold.",
      "Finance expert Kieran Maguire believes it would cost even more, telling SPORTbible recently: “Manchester United are a premium brand, a complete buyout would be at least £5bn but then a significant spend would be required on and off the pitch.",
      "“Current stock market value is about £3bn which is 15 per cent lower than at the end of June, despite all the rumours circulating [around] the club, which suggests the market is sceptical about whether a full blown bid is likely.”",
      "If this absolute mess is worth at least £5bn, you can certainly see why there is more of a greater appetite to sort the myriad issues rather than sell up.",
      "Matheus Cunha says his two months at Man Utd have felt like a lot longer and with a toxic environment and no obvious starting spot, can you blame him?",
      "Alexander Isak has declared ‘a crisis situation’ with he and his teammates ‘so f***ing dissatisfied’ and one player demanding that ‘the system’ is ‘removed’.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, Jude Bellingham, a ‘circus’ and an exhortation to ‘be more Roy Keane’. How is that going to help?",

      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports.",

      "Cunha joined United for £62.5m in the summer on the back of 15 goals and six assists in an outstanding 2024/2025 season for Wolves. But he’s yet to score or assist in seven games for his new club and was dropped to the bench by Ruben Amorim for the 2-0 win over Sunderland last time, with his replacement, Mason Mount, scoring and impressing in his stead.",
      "The Brazilian will be well aware of the number of quality players who have been signed by United for similarly hefty fees and failed to live up to expectations, and appears to already be feeling the stress.",
      "After leading the Selecao line in their 5-0 win over South Korea on Friday, Cunha admitted it feels as though he’s been at United for far longer than a couple of months amid his and his teammates’ struggle to pick up the positive results required to keep Ruben Amorim in the job.",
      "“I try as much as possible to adapt, to learn… it’s only been two months,” he said. “But it feels like I’ve been here for a long time because of the club’s current situation.”",

      "But perhaps most worrying of all, and this has been a criticism aimed at innumerable United stars for over a decade since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, is Cunha’s belief that he has ‘arrived’.",
      "“We live in a constant search for something. Even though a difficult moment when you’re pursuing a dream and encountering some obstacles leaves you feeling a bit lost,” he added.",
      "“You want to understand, and despite having so much, you don’t feel fulfilled by what you’ve achieved.",

      "In 15 damning words, a rejuvenated Marcus Rashford summed up the reason for his and almost all others’ inability to maintain peak performance levels at Manchester United, and why Sir Jim Ratcliffe is clinging to the increasingly false hope of Ruben Amorim turning things around at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford now has eight goal contributions in nine games for club and country, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has described him as an “unbelievable” talent and president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck. The £26m required to make his loan move permanent at the end of the season looks like an absurd bargain.",
      "But we’ve been here before with Rashford. After 43 goals and 22 assists across two seasons under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he was being linked with £100m moves abroad. 30 goals in all competitions under Erik ten Hag in 2022/2023 saw United hand him a very lucrative five-year contract to ward away the same eager suitors. But troughs have followed those peaks.",
      "Rashford scored just five goals in Solskjaer’s third season and eight in Ten Hag’s second. Suggestions of complacency, overconfidence and distraction have all been aimed at Rashford by people who don’t and can’t know why he’s never been able to sustain the top level required to be labelled a world class footballer. But Rashford himself has perfectly sound justification for his own inconsistency.",
      "“I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time,” he said.",
      "The 27-year-old had been asked by ITV ahead of England’s World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday what he thought about Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only thing preventing Rashford from being considered a truly elite footballer was his lack of consistency.",
      "“But I completely agree,” Rashford added. “I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train.",
      "“We have just had so many changes so far in my career but I have to look forward and that it definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often.",
      "“When I am at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport.”",
      "Ten games for Barcelona is evidently too small a sample size to make any grand claims over Rashford’s consistency, but his comments do speak to the predicament Ratcliffe and Ineos now find themselves in with regards to Amorim’s future at the club.",
      "Whether he will be given this time or – as we suspect – not, Ratcliffe said last week that Amorim needs “three years” at United to prove he’s a “great coach”. And while that felt like an almost farcical vote of confidence in a manager who’s overseen their worst Premier League season ever and has accrued just 37 points in 34 top flight games, the quest for consistency goes a long way to explaining it.",
      "Because having just one player – Bruno Fernandes – you could reasonably pick out as being a consistently good footballer in over a decade isn’t normal, not just for a club like Manchester United, but any football club.",
      "It’s far too simplistic to suggest that the chopping and changing of managers is solely to blame – other top clubs with a similar approach don’t suffer in the same way – and blindly sticking with the latest recruit just because they happen to be in charge when this dawning realisation occurs could be catastrophic.",
      "But it makes sense that Ratcliffe, in a bid to build a team of consistent footballers, is desperate to avoid the inconsistencies that Rashford, and doubtless others who have either left Manchester United or remain in the midst of the madness, see as the cause of their struggle to remain at the pinnacle once it’s been reached at Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona ‘will trigger’ their option to sign Marcus Rashford permanently from Manchester United next summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already decided whether to give FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford a ‘surprise lifetime’.",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports.",
      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back."

      "",
      "10) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): 4.33 SCAs per 90\nHaving a bloody lovely time at the right size club and thriving in that No. 10 role with Iliman Ndiaye and Jack Grealish either side. If Everton had a halfway competent striker, they would be flying.",
      "",
      "9) Kieran Trippier (Newcastle United): 4.40 SCAs per 90\nPretty much takes all the set-pieces, putting him behind only Granit Xhaka in terms of SCAs from dead balls this season. But he’s also creating chances from open play, none of which have been taken by a blunt Newcastle attack so far.",
      "",
      "7=) Oscar Bobb (Manchester City): 4.48 SCAs per 90\nWhen you play on the same team as Erling Haaland, you are going to log some serious chances. Bobb may not be a guaranteed starter in this Manchester City team but he is making a serious case for his involvement, notching six SCAs v Brentford in their last fixture before the international break.",
      "",
      "7=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool): 4.48 SCAs per 90\nThere he is. Not the highest chance-creator in the Premier League, but up there when it comes to involvement in Liverpool moves leading to shots on goal. There were eight such SCAs on his truly competitive debut against Bournemouth but you’re only as good as your last game…and that was poor v Chelsea.",
      "",
      "6) Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): 4.57 SCAs per 90\nHe’s played himself into the England team as a more defensive option but he is Forest’s most creative player this season, which is likely to make him the subject of serious transfer interest (most notably from Manchester United) in 2026. He was involved in all three Forest goals on the opening day of the season, before things went a bit mental.",
      "",
      "5) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal): 4.68 SCAs per 90\nEasing himself back into serious form and back into the England starting XI this season. The next Arsenal player on the list would be Noni Madueke in 22nd, which suggests that Mikel Arteta might have to find a way to get them both in the side.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish (Everton): 4.86 SCAs per 90\nEverton have scored nine Premier League goals this season; Grealish was involved in the build-up of six and scored one more. He is having a bloody lovely time on Merseyside. Again, imagine if Everton had a proper striker.",
      "",
      "3) Amad Diallo (Manchester United): 5.03 SCAs per 90\nInvolved in both Manchester United goals v Sunderland, Amad is one good reason why the club may still be clinging onto the idea that this formation would work under this manager.",
      "",
      "2) Jeremy Doku (Manchester City): 6.03 SCAs per 90\n“I ask the wingers in the final third to go one vs. one or one vs. two and I have the feeling that Jeremy’s decision-making in the final third improved, like, wow!”. Like wow indeed.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): 6.18 SCAs per 90\nNone of it has really come off as yet, but the idea that playing deeper is stymying his creativity is clearly a nonsense. Nobody creates more from open play in the Premier League; he was particularly brilliant against Arsenal on the opening day.",

      "Even regular readers of Football365 would not be surprised; we reported interest in August and then again in September, when we laughed off suggestions that the Crystal Palace and England midfielder could cost just £60m.",
      "The only shock at the weekend reports of a £60m Wharton deal is that Daily Star Chief Sports Writer Jeremy Cross has the gall to call this an ‘exclusive’. It’s either cheeky as f*** or incredibly lazy as ‘Wharton to Man Utd’ is more olds than news.",
      "We’re told in the headline, sub-headline and opening line that it’s a ‘shock £60m raid’. To who? To Cross? Certainly not to us or anybody else paying attention over the last two months.",

      "Well they can ‘believe’ all they want, but genuinely…will it balls.",
      "The irritating thing about this ‘exclusive’ is not necessarily that Cross is claiming an ‘exclusive’ on an old story, but that other outlets blindly follow suit, with The Sun saying that ‘MANCHESTER UNITED are reportedly plotting a shock £60million bid for Adam Wharton’.",
      "Literally three days before, they published a piece that said ‘Wharton has long been on the radar of United, Manchester City and Liverpool’. So it’s not a sodding ‘shock’ is it?",
      "Goal also call it a ‘shock’ move because where one leads, everybody follows like click-thirsty sheep.",
      "Obviously, since reports of this ‘shock move’, Palace chief Steve Parish has made it clear that Wharton has shown no interest in moving to another club, while telling talkSPORT: “I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, but I think he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace.”",

      "Adam Wharton issues Man Utd transfer demand as Crystal Palace star eyed",

      "The phrase ‘green light’, when not referring literally to a green light, means ‘permission to go ahead with a project’. Councils give green lights to planning applications, company directors give green lights to budgets, and in football terms, sporting directors give green lights to transfers.",
      "You know what you absolutely need to give a green light? Control over the lighting system. If you have no power, then you cannot give permission.",
      "Which brings us to the Mirror and this monstrosity of a headline:",

      "That’s not a ‘green light’ to a transfer; that’s one footballer admiring the work of another footballer.",
      "This was not ‘a glowing review to any potential suitors – including United’; this was one footballer admiring the work of another footballer.",
      "Yes, it’s the international break. But does that mean we have to pretend Jack Grealish is about to join Manchester United? Now that would be a ‘shock’…",

      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "Manchester United can never dominate with a formation made for counter-punchers for reasons outlined in full here.",

      "The Sun have sold this as a ‘double blow’ for Man Utd and I’m about to explain why that is a bit of a stretch…",
      "Firstly, they have a fair point on Wharton as he “will want to play in the Champions League”, thus making a move to rivals Liverpool far more likely at this stage.",
      "“Look, I think Adam at some point will want to play, either in the Champions League with us, if we could make that happen, or probably with another club,” Parish said.",
      "“He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, but I think he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "“He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had, which a lot of young players get. This season he’s completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us. I think he’s very committed to the club.",
      "“I mean, if Manchester United want Adam Wharton, that’s nothing surprising really. The fact of the matter is he’s got a long contract to run. There’s no pressure on us to do it and I don’t think there’s any real pressure from the player either.”",
      "The other supposed ‘blow’ for Man Utd is that Parish and Glasner have held talks over a new contract.",
      "“We would love to keep Oliver. We’re building something. I think for Oliver, it’s about the conditions being right,” Parish added on “early conversations” with Glasner.",
      "“It’s about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work, and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve.",
      "“Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that. He’s in football for those days where we give all that pleasure to the fans. And we do as well.",
      "“So, if we can align those interests, then hopefully we can make something happen.”",
      "In reality, these “conversations” mean very little as they certainly do not mean that Glasner will sign a contract extension at Palace beyond next summer.",
      "Glasner “wants to win things” and as good as Palace have been over the past couple of years, he will look elsewhere to give himself a far greater chance of achieving that goal.",
      "It has also been reported that Glasner is “set” on the Man Utd job as Ruben Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Should Glasner join Man Utd? Probably not, as there are other elite opportunities available as safer bets for the Palace boss.",
      "But football managers are nothing if not egotistical, and Glasner, who is riding the crest of a wave at Palace, would back himself to be the one to fix Man Utd, who proved in the summer that they can still attract their top targets to Old Trafford despite their prolonged period of misery.",

      "“I was happy for my friend and also that we managed to stay up. I don’t care about Man City. My friend finally won the Premier League after many years in England and I was happy for him and also for me. That’s all.”",

      "“Five or six of the team did. I can hear it getting shouted from the sidelines. We had all been in City’s academy. You had Nedum Onuoha, Shaun Wright-Phillips and myself. So we would have wanted Manchester City to win the league over Man United, make no bones about that.",
      "“But at the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",

      "“Your conspiracy theories, Wazza, are untrue. Sometimes people tell you stuff in life and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative and you want to have that cognitive dissonance.",

      "In the summer, after last season’s 15th-placed Premier League finish, Fernandes was offered huge money to ditch the Red Devils in order to move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He said at the time that he did not want to leave, but if United were willing to sell, he’d part ways with them.",
      "United decided against letting him go, but it seems the chances of a move to the Saudi Pro League are more likely, per insider Bailey.",
      "He told United In Focus: “Bruno Fernandes has made it clear to Manchester United that he will not be pushed out of the club, hence his quotes about the Saudi Pro League.",
      "“Fernandes considered the Saudi Pro League last summer, but both the player and United were not keen. Since then, things have changed. Sources confirm that United have indeed held talks with the Pro League about Fernandes.",

      "Fernandes has recently cleared the air on his reasons for staying at United, saying: “I didn’t close the door to move to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup — that was never on my mind. I just wanted to stay at the club, and the club wanted me to stay. That’s all.”",
      "Given the suggestion that United have held talks over Fernandes’ sale, it seems they might no longer want him to stay, and as that was one of the main drivers of him remaining at the club last summer, his view might soon change.",

      "United spent around £170million in the summer, largely on attacking talents. Of their five signings, three – Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo – play in the attack.",
      "Sesko has scored twice in the Premier League, Mbeumo once, while Cunha is yet to get off the mark.",
      "The nine goals scored by United in the league this season is fairly middling, and they are ninth in the table as a result.",
      "Waddle feels that to take the next step, though they have just signed three attackers, one more needs to come in, and he has named that man.",
      "Waddle said: “Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now.",

      "“People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "“If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them.",
      "“He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "“You could see a real team developing, especially with Bruno Fernandes in behind. There’s a lot more to do, but I can see them building a team there.",
      "“He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.”",
      "Waddle’s suggestion that Semenyo could play in attack with Cunha and Sesko would mean there was no space for Mbeumo, and that would be a surprise given he’s had more impact than Cunha so far this term.",
      "It is conceivable that Semenyo would leave Bournemouth for United, as Cunha and Mbeumo were both at similar stature teams – Brentford finished above United last season – but still joined them.",
      "But he’ll have seen that neither is having the same impact there, and for a player with six goals and three assists in seven Premier League games this season, he won’t want to risk becoming less impactful by making a move to the wrong side.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the minority owner at United, has said he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "Ultimately, this is a United side that is suffering from scars from a mentally tough previous season - finishing 15th as well as losing a European final. They have lost a lot of games as well, 21 of Ruben Amorim's 50 in charge.",
      "But despite disappointing losses and performances to the likes of Grimsby and Brentford, there is still a feeling of optimism inside the walls of Carrington.",
      "United feel, despite some of the poor results, that their data and metrics show that this side are improving. The eye test suggests that they are as well, looking at the performance against Arsenal, and first halves against Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "The Sunderland performance demonstrated flexibility from Amorim, something he has been accused of lacking. The team defended in a 4-4-2 and attacked in a 3-4-3.",
      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",
      "United's ultimate aim for this season is a return to European football. Whether that is the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League - we will have to wait and see where this team can end up, but the reality is this team is still being rebuilt.",
      "The next run of fixtures will give all watching a better indication of what will be possible this season - with away trips to Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham and just the one home fixture to Brighton before the next break - no matter how the results go, we will learn a lot.",
      "The £200m new look front line of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha all look back to match fitness, as well as Mount, who scored a lovely goal against Sunderland before the break.",
      "If United can rescue a positive season from a rollercoaster start, there is room for optimism next summer in what could be an intriguing transfer window for United.",
      "With big contracts set to expire, there will have to be decisions made on the likes of Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "There is a realistic prospect that the Brazilian's contract won't be renewed next summer and his three-year stay at United could come to an end.",
      "If that does happen, the freed-up space on the wage bill would represent an opportunity for United to strengthen in that area of the pitch.",
      "A midfielder remains a key area for United to strengthen next summer and although they have been long-term admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, he is just one of a number of players they have looked at in the position.",
      "After a £50m redevelopment of the men's first-team training facility completed in the summer, United's next aim at Carrington is to upgrade their academy facilities.",
      "United have gone through change at their academy leadership level - with new academy director Stephen Torpey succeeding Nick Cox, who has joined Everton as technical director.",
      "With Torpey's recent arrival, United, led by director of football Wilcox, are keen to accelerate plans to rebuild the academy in the hope the facilities will match some of the best in the world.",
      "United decided not to develop the academy facilities at the same time as the men's first team as it would have been too disruptive on site, but having invested in both the men's and women's facilities in recent years, their next focus is the academy.",
      "United have some exciting emerging talents such as 15-year-old JJ Gabriel, who has been starring for Darren Fletcher's U18 side.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is under pressure after a mixed start to the season followed last term's 15th-placed finish; Man Utd's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given him a huge vote of support: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",

      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.",
      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.",
      "\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.",
      "\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
