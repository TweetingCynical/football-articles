      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo may now have reason to stay at Old Trafford. The England international was linked with a move before deadline day, but injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount potentially offers him a chance for a run of games.",
      "Cunha, a £62.5million summer signing from Wolves, picked up an injury in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley. It was Joshua Zirkzee who took his place on that occasion, but another option to make up for the Brazilian's absence involves pushing Bruno Fernandes forward and installing Mainoo in central midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "That's exactly what happened later in the game when Mount's afternoon also came to an early end. Now, according to The Mail, the pair of injuries may end up standing in the way of a Mainoo exit - though United have yet to learn how long they will be without Mount and Cunha.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim, for his part, has maintained he wants Mainoo to stay at Old Trafford. \"I want Kobbie to stay, He needs to fight for his place,\" the boss said.",
      "\"And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Despite the injuries, United claimed a narrow win over Burnley. Bruno Fernandes converted a stoppage-time penalty to settle the clash after the Clarets had trice equalised.",
      "The victory ensures Amorim's side will go into the international break in mid-table, but there has been talk of more transfer business - both ins and outs. A new goalkeeper could yet arrive, while Antony is among the players who could yet leave the club.",
      "\"I was frustrated like any Man Utd fan, we had chances to score more goals, create more chances,\" Amorim told Match of the Day after his team's victory. \"Today, the football was fair - we were the better team.",
      "\"Some moments are really decisive. Sometimes we were not playing so well, but you can see the effort of everyone on the pitch wanting to win.\"",
      "United's first match after the international break is a big one, with Amorim's side taking on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. City will go into the game ahead of United if they avoid defeat on Sunday against Brighton.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It's the penultimate day of the transfer window and there's no shortage of work to complete for clubs around the world. There is little over 24 hours to get deals over the line before the opportunity disappears until January.",
      "There remain big names who could be on the move with work in the Premier League far from over. It remains to be seen whether Liverpool break the transfer record once again to land Alexander Isak, after Newcastle signed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart.",
      "Arsenal look set to get another deal over the line with Piero Hincapie set to become the Gunners' eighth signing of the summer. The Ecuador star is set to initially join on loan before completing a £45million move.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's name could yet dominate the final hours too. The Chelsea star was set to join Bayern Munich before the Blues cancelled the move and the striker is not happy.",
      "Exits appear on the agenda for Manchester United however with Rasmus Hojlund seemingly set for a move to Napoli on loan. Real Betis have withdrawn their offer for Antony however, while the Red Devils are desperate to keep hold of wantway midfielder Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Hamburg are close to agreeing a permanent deal with Arsenal for Albert Sambi Lokonga, per sources in Germany.HSV are expected to be a modest fee as the Belgian midfielder's contract in north London expires in the summer of 2026. It's understood Arsenal triggered a 12-month extension option earlier this summer to protect the player's value.Lokonga had also been courted by Greek side PAOK after joining the Gunners from Anderlecht in the summer of 2021. He spent time on loan at Crystal Palace, Luton Town and Sevilla before returning to the Emirates at the end of last season but it was clear he would not be part of Mikel Arteta's plans moving forward.",
      "Eddie Howe made it clear he had \"no knowledge\" of a supposed meeting in which Alexander Isak said goobye and insisted he \"would know\" if it had occurred, despite Swedish TV reports.",
      "When pressed further on the supposed meeting, Howe added: \"I have no knowledge of that, I can't tell you it didn't happen, but I certainly can't tell you it did. That is the first I have heard of it. I am pretty sure I would have known.\"",
      "With the prospect of Harvey Elliott moving to RB Leipzig, Liverpool have a replacement in mind. The German side are reluctant to meet the Reds' asking price but the Anfield side are making preparations.",
      "A late move for Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers could arrive, per reports.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's advisor, Diomansy Kamara, has sent a defiant message after Chelsea put an end to hopes of the forward joining Bayern Munich on loan. The Senegal striker travelled to Munich on Saturday to complete a deal but saw his permission to conduct a medical revoked before the end of the day.",
      "It feels a situation that could have more twists and turns with Jackson said to be furious and the forward's camp working to keep a deal alive.",
      "Manchester United are making a shock £40million bid for Aston Villa keeper Emi Martinez. The Reds rejected the chance to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer when it was deemed that a deal would be too expensive when his £200,000-a-week wages were thrown into the mix.",
      "United set their sights on Royal Antwerp’s highly-coveted young stopper Senne Lammens, but now look ready to sanction a costly short-term solution with Martinez instead.",
      "Thanks for joining us! There isn't long to go now and still a number of deals to get over the line. Stick around for the latest updates."

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's legacy as arguably the greatest manager in English football history has only been solidified by Manchester United's dramatic downfall since his retirement.",
      "Since the legendary Scot said goodbye to Old Trafford in 2013, not only have the Red Devils failed to clinch a Premier League title, but a combination of boardroom chaos and dismal on-pitch performances has slowly eroded the aura that Ferguson so meticulously built.",
      "A significant factor in this decline has been poor player recruitment, with United often splashing out exorbitant sums for underperforming stars.",
      "Fans fume at latest VAR controversy as Premier League issue explanation - 'Game's gone'",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma costing PSG millions as Man City stance becomes clear",
      "Despite shelling out over £200million on new talent this summer, United supporters are yet to be convinced that the club's fortunes will change.",
      "Ecuadorian winger Valencia was snapped up after catching Ferguson's eye at Wigan Athletic. Although £16m might seem like a drop in the ocean in today's transfer market, it was a hefty fee at the time.",
      "Valencia, who spent a decade at Old Trafford and played over 300 times, proved to be exceptional value for the money. Initially a right winger, he was converted to a right-back and even captained the side under Jose Mourinho before moving abroad in 2019.",
      "He has since moved into coaching in retirement.",
      "The Canada-born midfielder's career had been plagued by injuries, and his time in the Premier League was no different. Hargreaves managed only 39 appearances across a four-year stint for the Red Devils.",
      "After leaving United, he had a brief spell at Manchester City but played just one Premier League match before being released.",
      "Carrick, most recently the head coach of Middlesbrough, was already considered one of England's best technical midfielders when he was signed by United - and it's fair to say he lived up to the hype.",
      "The former West Ham and Tottenham midfielder evolved as a player over the years after joining in 2006 and even captained the side in the latter stages of his career.",
      "Carrick won five Premier League titles and the Champions League, cementing his place as a club legend by the time he retired after 12 years at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite a shaky start at United, Sir Alex Ferguson's 2011 signing of De Gea turned out to be a masterstroke.",
      "The current Fiorentina star went on to become one of the most outstanding goalkeepers in the club's history, winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award four times.",
      "He clocked up a total of 545 appearances before leaving in the summer of 2023, proving to be an unshakeable presence between the sticks during his prime years.",
      "When it comes to bang for your buck, few on this list can rival De Gea's longevity and success.",
      "During his five-year stint at United, Van Nistelrooy was a goal-scoring powerhouse. Signed from PSV Eindhoven in 2001 for a then-record British fee, the highest praise anyone can give the Dutchman is that he effortlessly filled the boots of Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole.",
      "His tenure at United wasn't as laden with trophies as it coincided with a period of transition for the club, with Arsenal and Chelsea instead taking home the silverware.",
      "However, Van Nistelrooy still netted an impressive 150 goals in 219 matches, clinching the Premier League in 2002/03 and the FA Cup in 2003/04.",
      "He had the opportunity to manage his former club temporarily following Erik ten Hag's exit last year, before a disappointing spell at the helm of Leicester City, who he couldn't prevent from being relegated.",
      "The audacious capture of Arsenal captain Van Persie, right from under their noses, made the Dutch striker one of United's most contentious signings during the Fergie era.",
      "However, fans quickly overlooked his past as the current Feyenoord boss swiftly became a favourite at Old Trafford, still celebrated today for his debut 2012/2013 season.",
      "He scored an impressive 30 goals that year, helping to secure the league title for Ferguson in his final attempt, making him a steal at just £24m. Van Persie continued to spearhead United's attack for another two years before transferring to Fenerbahce.",
      "Rooney was one of English football's brightest talents when he signed for United as a teenager with a hefty £27m fee from his childhood club, Everton. But even then, Ferguson and his team knew they had a gem on their hands.",
      "The England ace became United's top scorer of all time during his 13-year tenure at Old Trafford, netting 253 goals in 559 appearances, surpassing all those who had played before him at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "His managerial career hasn't matched his playing days, though, with Rooney now serving as a pundit on Match of the Day for the BBC.",
      "There are a few flops on this list, but Veron's £28m transfer to United is rightly considered one. The midfielder became England's priciest player back in 2001 but failed to meet expectations during his stint at the club.",
      "Despite struggling to replicate his stunning form from Italy, he made 82 appearances and won the Premier League before moving to Chelsea after two seasons. Veron is still widely recognised as Ferguson's biggest transfer mistake.",
      "He now serves as the chairman of Estudiantes de La Plata in his native Argentina.",
      "Rio Ferdinand became both the world's most expensive defender and the priciest British footballer in history when he moved from United's fierce rivals, Leeds, in 2002.",
      "However, it proved to be money well spent, with Ferdinand establishing himself as one of the greatest defenders of his generation. He spent 12 years at Old Trafford, making over 450 appearances before returning to London to finish his career.",
      "Ferdinand's formidable partnership with Nemanja Vidic was the foundation that allowed United to win the 2008 Champions League and numerous other trophies during some of the best years of Ferguson's lengthy tenure.",
      "He now discusses his former club extensively on his YouTube channel, having left TNT at the end of last season.",
      "But perhaps not everyone knows that, at £31m, the striker is Fergie's most expensive ever signing.",
      "Despite his laid-back and occasionally exasperating style, the former Spurs star was a huge success at Tottenham before being lured away to boost United's attacking prowess.",
      "He scored 56 goals in 149 outings for the Red Devils, clinching two league titles during a four-year spell, before returning to London with Fulham. He now serves as a Betfair ambassador and regularly discusses his former club in the media."

The Portuguese coach has suggested any critique must be aimed at the whole team with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir facing a 'difficult job' defending their goal this term.",
      "The Red Devils claimed their first win of the season against Burnley at Old Trafford, but Bayindir could not escape the 3-2 victory without more questions being raised. The 27-year-old was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal in the 66th minute which drew the scores level at 2-2.",
      "Bayindir failed to push a save wide which allowed Anthony to take advantage for an equaliser. The mistake follows weak goalkeeping against Arsenal which allowed Riccardo Calafiori's goal and an uncertain performance against Fulham.",
      "Onana dropped to the bench against the Clarets after committing two errors of his own in United's catastrophic defeat against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. But Bayindir's return would not have sparked confidence.",
      "And despite persistent links to a new goalkeeper this summer, Amorim attempted to channel criticism away from his shotstoppers. \"Guys, they are humans,\" said the head coach following the win over Burnley.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",
      "Amorim was happy to gather three points ahead of the international break. United's boss could not help but have some frustration however.",

We now have two weeks with a lot of opportunities. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do.\"",

      "Instead, United set their sights on Royal Antwerp’s highly-coveted young stopper Senne Lammens, after beating a number of top European rivals for his £20million signature. It was believed that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening’s transfer deadline. The 23-year-old is seen as the man who will replace Thibaut Courtois as Belgium’s No.1.",
      "But United now look ready to sanction a costly short-term solution with Martinez instead of planning for the future. Martinez celebrates his 33rd birthday on Tuesday and his age and combustible character have prompted Villa to look to cash in.",
      "United feel that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a gamble they have to take, even though the club are flirting with PSR problems having already spent more than £200million on new signings this summer.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim does not trust £43million Andre Onana or Turkish back-up Altay Bayindir. Onana was axed from United's team for the 3-2 win over Burnley at Old Trafford after a dodgy display in the shock Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby in midweek.",
      "But Bayindir, who was at fault for Fulham's equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last week, blundered again when the Clarets levelled for a second time.",
      "Interestingly, Villa are themselves looking to make a late deadline-beating move, to take West Ham's Lucas Paqueta to the West Midlands. Unai Emery has been pushing club chiefs to strengthen his squad but PSR issues have meant the Villans haven't been able to add how the Spaniard has wanted.",
      "But having already cashed in on homegrown midfielder Jacob Ramsey, moving out Martinez in the next 36 hours will give them breathing space moving forwards, even as they seek to add Paqueta. They've been holding talks over a loan move with a £50m transfer obligation next summer, and while the Brazil international is keen on the move, West Ham don't like the current terms. Villa being able to pay more cash now and making the transfer permanent from the off would help.",
      "A new goalkeeper would likely also arrive, although Emery may be happy to let new veteran stopper Marco Bizot hold the fort until January if they can't land the replacement for Martinez that they want.",

      "Should all of those leave, it could potentially open the door to more new arrivals for the under-fire Ruben Amorim. A midfielder and a new goalkeeper are potentially on the agenda but some serious work needs to be done for those two signings to be completed.",

      "Manchester United bosses still fear that Ruben Amorim could WALK OUT - despite seeing his team salvage a huge win over Burnley thanks to captain Bruno Fernandes’ injury-time penalty. United secured their first victory of the new season in a dramatic ­finale just as newly-promoted ­ Burnley looked set to deliver another devastating blow to the beleaguered boss.",
      "Reds’ chiefs remain steadfast in their belief that Amorim can turn around the team. But the 40-year-old needs to ­control the erratic behaviour that has become a cause for concern.",
      "Talk was rife inside Old Trafford in the aftermath of the seismic ­Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby on Wednesday night that Amorim might be ready to walk away during the international break regardless of the result against Burnley. That prospect may have subsided for now after the boost of a dramatic first victory of the new season.",
      "But Amorim said: “I’m not thinking about a turning point. I’ve had this conversation with you guys like 10 times. It’s day by day. I’m happy. We returned a little bit to our level today.",
      "“If you take away Wednesday, we are more consistent in the performance compared to last year. That’s a good thing.”",
      "Some senior players are disillusioned with Amorim’s steadfast commitment to the tactical formation that served him so well at Sporting Lisbon but does not fit the profile of his squad in Manchester.",
      "He has alienated others with his habit of going public with criticism they feel should be kept in-house. After the defeat at Blundell Park he admitted that sometimes he hated his players.",
      "Amorim has also not been afraid to voice his doubts about whether he is a good fit for the job.",
      "Alarm bells started ringing in the boardroom in May when Amorim declared he would be prepared to leave United without seeking a compensation package if he felt stepping away would benefit both himself and the club.",
      "He came out after the Burnley win to defend keeper Altay Bayindir after the Turkey international’s latest blunder allowed Jaidon Anthony to fire home the Clarets’ second equaliser.",
      "Amorim said: “Yes, in some moments [I hate the players]. But when they put in the effort, I will always love them. We need to understand that we should have always been on this level of effort.",
      "“We played well in the beginning. When the match was not so perfect, you can feel that the team struggled a little bit – but the effort was always there.",
      "“Guys, they are humans. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. But I think it’s hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "“The players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it’s not just the goalkeepers. Everybody has to improve.”",
      "United feel they have backed Amorim to the hilt – both in terms of transfer funds and banishing big-name players like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia from his squad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo claimed that Manchester United’ s dramatic win vs Burnley was not just for under-fire Ruben Amorim - but for the whole club. The Red Devils boss had found himself under pressure following a dire start to the campaign.",
      "United failed to win each of their opening two Premier League games and saw their Carabao Cup journey ended at the first stage with a humiliating defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "But they managed to secure their first victory of the campaign on Saturday as they squeezed past Burnley 3-2 - Bruno Fernandes firing home a dramatic late penalty. Mbeumo also got on the scoresheet with his first Premier League goal for United.",
      "It was his second goal in as many games following his strike at Grimsby. Asked if the win was to ease the pressure on Amorim, he claimed that wasn’t the case.",
      "He said: \"We are all a team, it is not only one person. We all worked very hard for the win today.\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"Every game is hard and important. We had the game with us in the first half, but we had to fight every minute. I'm very happy, and we win as well - as a striker, it is important to be confident with goals.\"",
      "And while Mbeumo was left delighted with United’s win, he pointed to the importance of getting back on track following their humiliation at Grimsby. He said: \"It's a big club, the expectations are high and we need to deal with it. But a great feeling to win here.",
      "\"With what happened in the week, we had to react with a win. That's what we've done.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Amorim claimed that United were full value for their win despite the fortuitous circumstances in which the win arrived. He said: \"It ended well, think we deserved to win the game. I think we created a lot of chances. We should go to the half-time with a bigger advantage.",
      "“And then…every possession near our box, they can score, we are in that moment, so we start always chasing a lot of things. But we deserved and we tried until the last minute to score goals, we had our chances and in the end we deserved to win.”",
      "United’s dramatic win against Burnley leaves them ninth in the Premier League on four points, with their beaten opponents two places behind. The Red Devils now have two weeks out of action due to the first international break of the season, while they have a clash with Manchester City to look forward to.",

      "And then he was gone. Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho has departed the Red Devils, leaving behind the Carrington 'Bomb Squad' of which he has been a part this summer, and completed his £40million move to Chelsea.",
      "The Argentina international, still just 21, has inked a deal with the Blues until 2032. His exit has been on the cards since he grew increasingly exasperated with his role under Ruben Amorim - despite being a regular under the Portuguese for much of last season - and finally spoke out after May's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, a match which he started on the bench.",
      "Days later, Amorim told Garnacho to find himself a new club this summer. Garnacho duly spent pre-season training away from United's first-team having expressed a desire to leave. And now he has his move, to long-time admirers, with Chelsea having initially sought to do a deal in January. As well as the £40m, United also hold a 10 percent sell-on clause.",
      "“It’s an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club,” Garnacho said, whose agents, Carlos Cambeiro and Quique de Lucas, were initially spotted at Stamford Bridge in January. “I can’t wait to get started.",
      "“I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special – we’re the best team in the world! It’s amazing to be here and I’m very happy.”",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and scored 26 goals in 144 appearances after progressing through the academy.",
      "He becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival of the summer and fifth attacking addition, following Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, the Blues finally pushing through his signing after completing Christopher Nkunku's exit, the French international moving to AC Milan.",
      "But he also comes at the personal request of head coach Enzo Maresca, who believes the opportunity to add Garnacho to his attack - particularly at that price - was too good to pass up.",

      "If Ruben Amorim has full confidence in Benjamin Sesko he is not showing it. Sesko has been left on the bench in United's opening two Premier League games before making an underwhelming debut from the start in Wednesday night's embarrassment at Grimsby.",
      "He duly returned to the bench for the visit of Burnley. Amorim though had the ideal opportunity to bring him on earlier than planned when Matheus Cunha went down with an injury issue in the first-half. That problem would force him off, but rather than turn to his £74million signing in Sesko, he bought on Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has scored just seven goals during his time in Manchester, yet he was the man Amorim turned to, rather than Sesko himself.",
      "The Slovenian came on with 72 minutes on the clock as the game with Burnley was perfectly poised at 2-2, but he could not find the winning goal. His best chance came when he rose highest from a Bryan Mbeumo cross, only to head over when he should've done better. It was Bruno Fernandes who scored a 97th minute winner for the Red Devils as he converted from the spot in dramatic circumstances.",
      "It means Sesko remains looking for his first goal, although minutes have been at a premium. In United's opening three games Sesko has played just over 90 minutes.",
      "Compare that to Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, who has been thrown in straight away to lead the line and scored twice. That is what you'd expect from any player who costs north of £50m, but Sesko finds himself still waiting for his first Premier League start.",
      "United were beaten in a shootout by Grimsby in midweek, a Carabao Cup humiliation. Their new hitman waited for every other outfield player to step up before he chose to have a go from 12 yards. He would score, but was it down to a lack of confidence?",
      "It later emerged that Sesko, who admittedly has an impressive record from the penalty spot, was struggling with cramp, having played the full 90 minutes that evening. It was the striker’s first full 90' in a competitive game since April 19, but sources close to the player have insisted he wanted to take one. United's coaching staff decided he shouldn't.",
      "United have seen a number of expensive investments in front men fail to pay off in recent times - some more costly than others. Rasmus Hojlund joined in a £72m deal two years ago and is now poised for a loan exit to Napoli.",
      "Sesko needs to be a success and will need to find top gear to do so. But he can't do that unless the handbrake is taken off.",

      "The Red Devils had thrown away the lead twice at Old Trafford, as Burnley looked on course to come away a 2-2 draw. But when Jaidon Anthony pulled Amad's shirt inside the penalty area deep into stoppage time, referee Sam Barrott was instructed to go over to the pitch-side monitor.",
      "After a lengthy check, Barrott pointed to the spot and Fernandes grabbed the ball. Only last Sunday, the 30-year-old blazed a penalty over the crossbar during the Red Devils' deflating 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "Although he'd scored twice in the midweek penalty shootout against Grimsby Town, Fernandes still had unfinished business from the spot. And he did, burying his shot past Burnley goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who'd guessed right but couldn't keep it out of the net.",
      "While drama was unfolding, Amorim couldn't watch and rested his legs on the dugout. When the ball hit the back of the net, the United manager wasn't celebrating like the rest of Old Trafford but rather keeping a composed figure.",
      "On why he didn't watch the penalty, Amorim explained to Premier League Productions: \"I like to see the image of the fans. What has to be has to be. In that moment, I was thinking, it would be fair to win the game. And I did not think Bruno would miss a second in a row.\"",
      "The Portuguese coach was then asked if he was thinking of his future as Red Devils boss when Fernandes stepped up. \"No, I was just thinking Bruno was not going to miss,\" Amorim replied.",
      "Will Manchester United kick on after the international break? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "On the game itself, which had plenty of pros and cons for Amorim to consider, he said: \"It is three points, if you look at the game we should solve it in the first half and control the game - but we are fighting to the last minute because of things we overcomplicate.",
      "\"Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score. You feel you can control the game. But one throw in, one set piece. I shook my head, because sometimes football is like this. We now have two weeks with a lot of opportunities. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do.\"",

      "Premier League fans have slammed VAR for ‘killing the game’ following controversy between Manchester United and Burnley. The Red Devils looked to be on the way to extending their winless start to the season - only for Bruno Fernandes to notch a 97th minute winner from the penalty spot after VAR intervention.",
      "With the scores level at 2-2 and United running out of time, they were given a golden chance to win the game after Amad was hauled down by Jaidon Anthony as he attempted to run through. The referee was sent to the VAR monitor and decided that the foul continued to take place inside the box - then duly pointed to the spot.",
      "But supporters were not convinced that was the right decision. Taking to Twitter, one fan said: “Only Man Utd could get a penalty for a shirt pull OUTSIDE the box. Another win for VAR.” Another added: “How can that be a penalty? It’s a freekick since it happened outside the box. VAR helps Man Utd today.”",
      "United captain Fernandes eventually tucked home the resulting spot-kick in the 97th minute of the game. But criticism for the decision continued to come.",
      "A fan responded: “Burnley have been robbed here. VAR is killing the game,” while a further supporter wrote: “VAR is having a nightmare weekend so far. Again, they’ve manufactured a win out of nowhere for Man United there.”",
      "And while fans were critical of the decision, ex-Liverpool star Stephen Warnock claimed that it was the right one. He said: “Penalty. Anthony switches off for a second and it's a little one two around him from Amad. The shirt pull starts outside the box but continues inside. It's panic more than anything.”",
      "Speaking after Fernandes had found the net, he added: “It's a get out of jail card for United. They have been poor in the second half and Burnley have been the better side and looked very comfortable. That is a moment that could change United's season and give them that bit of momentum.”",
      "The late penalty wasn’t the only moment of controversy at Old Trafford throughout what was a thrilling afternoon. United thought they had a penalty early on for Kyle Walker’s foul on Mason Mount but upon review, that decision was overturned.",
      "Elsewhere, Burnley thought they had scored through Lyle Foster immediately after United had taken a 2-1 lead but that goal was chalked off due to a tight offside call.",
      "United’s late win leaves them ninth in the Premier League heading into the international break, while Burnley are just two places below them.",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored a 97th-minute penalty to give Manchester United their first win of the season and ease the pressure on Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils, who came into Saturday's Premier League clash with Burnley off the back of their midweek humiliation in Grimsby, were pegged back twice by the visitors but snatched a 3-2 victory at the death.",
      "The game got off to a controversial start, as United's dominant play led to a penalty - or so they thought. Following a VAR review, Sam Barrott overturned his original decision to give a foul on Mason Mount by Kyle Walker.",
      "United decided to take matters into their own hands but they needed a stroke of luck to take the lead. Josh Cullen's own goal made it 1-0 before half-time but there was a momentum swing at the start of the second half, as Burnley came out of the blocks firing and equalised through Lyle Foster.",
      "Scott Parker's team were only level for 11 seconds, as Bryan Mbeumo put Amorim's side back ahead. Burnley didn't let their heads drop, though, and equalised once again through Jaidon Anthony.",
      "But Anthony would soon be the villain, as his 'sustained' holding of Amad's shirt just inside the box in stoppage time led to another a lengthy VAR check. This time, a penalty was given and Fernandes made up for last weekend's miss at Fulham.",
      "Here are six talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "When he most needed it, looked like Ruben Amorim had been given the dream start by his players. United were purring in the opening stages, as Leny Yoro forced a save from Martin Dubravka before Bryan Mbeumo went close on two occasions.",
      "Then a mistake from Kyle Walker gave Mason Mount a sniff and the United No.7 drove towards the penalty area. The pair made contact and Mount went bundling down, resulting in referee Sam Barrott awarding United a penalty.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had the ball in hands, ready to make amends. A VAR check was taking place for what most of the stadium believed to be in order to determine whether or not the foul took place inside the 18-yard box.",
      "But there was no foul after all. Barrott was sent to the pitch-side monitor and overturned his decision, telling Old Trafford that Walker hadn't committed any offence, as a drop ball was awarded to restart play.",
      "Sometimes, you need a bit of fortune. But given their dominant start, United will argue that they made their own luck for when Josh Cullen's own goal broke the deadlock on 27 minutes.",
      "Casemiro rose highest at a free-kick and after his header cannoned back off the crossbar, the ball hit the helpless Cullen, firing it back towards goal. Dubravka did his best to keep the ball out but Barrott's watch indicated that it had indeed gone over the line, sending the Stretford End into jubliation.",
      "Just as things were looking up, the Red Devils lost one of their summer signings through injury. Matheus Cunha went down in serious discomfort, seemingly in his right hamstring.",
      "The Brazilian forward couldn't continue and hobbled off, putting his participation for Brazil during the international break into deep jeopardy. Fellow new signing Benjamin Sesko was expected to replace Cunha but Amorim opted to give Joshua Zirkzee his first minutes of the Premier League campaign, a decision which raised eyebrows.",
      "At half-time, another potential injury blow emerged. Mount was withdraw and still Sesko wasn't the man, as Kobbie Mainoo - amid intense speculation over his future - entered the fray for the second half.",
      "Burnley started the better in what turned out to be a goal-fest of a second half, troubling United and gaining much more territory than they had done in the second half. And the equaliser didn't take long.",
      "Scott Parker's men were rightly growing in confidence and knew that United would give them a chance. The Red Devils' defence was all jumbled up in the 54th minute to allow Jacob Bruun Larsen space on the left flank.",
      "Diogo Dalot rushed out but he was too late, allowing Bruun Larsen's cross to be met by Lyle Foster, who finished past Altay Bayindir. Burnley had drawn level but the parity would only last 11 seconds.",
      "A long ball from Bayindir after kick-off found Zirkzee, who headed on for Dalot to collect. The United wing-back looked to his right and there was Mbeumo, who'd put the brakes on earlier than Burnley's defence to give himself space.",
      "For his second goal in four days, the £71million forward blasted home and the Clarets were once again behind. On the touchline, Amorim shook his head in disbelief.",
      "For Amorim, the head shaking wasn't over. Instead of being rocked by United's second goal, Burnley got back on the horse and pulled themselves level within nine minutes.",
      "Jaidon Anthony was the goalscorer, having been Jonny on the spot to Bayindir's parry from a Loum Tchaouna shot. But the root cause of the goal was Walker's long throw-in which was flicked on twice.",
      "The Red Devils' woes from set pieces and throw-ins are clear to see. Having replaced Andre Onana from the midweek cup exit, there'll also be questions of Bayindir's role amid United's pursuit of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "After being denied the chance to make up for last Sunday's miss earlier in the game, Fernandes was given one at the death in dramatic circumstances. In the seventh minute of stoppage time, after a long, long wait, the man who blazed his effort high over the bar at Craven Cottage didn't miss again.",
      "A wave of relief rushed over Old Trafford - everywhere but from the devastated away section. Their performance left much to be desired but United have finally found a way to win.",
      "There's work to do for Amorim both during and after the international break. As for Burnley, it was a cruel ending to an afternoon full of resilience.",

      "Amorim's side had picked up just one point from their opening two league games and were also dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby in midweek - making their late show against Burnley all the more vital.",
      "Pressure has ramped up on the Portuguese boss who has struggled for answers in his 10 month tenure thus far. Despite spending more than £200million in the summer United have shown few improvements this term. Their most expensive recruit, Benjamin Sesko, was left on the bench for the third straight league game despite costing £74milllion. He was tipped to lead the team's line but has not had the desired impact and was criticised in midweek for taking the 10th penalty at Blundell Park.",
      "In what was potentially a telling call, Amorim chose to bring on the unconvincing Joshua Zirkzee in the first-half when Matheus Cunha was forced off injured. In doing so he overlooked Sesko, who remained sat on the bench until the 72nd minute, but he struggled to make much of an impact during his brief cameo.",
      "Amorim was again apologetic for Wednesday's embarrassing cup exit at the hands of the League Two outfit as he said in his programme notes: “Good afternoon and welcome back to Old Trafford. Today, as we welcome Scott Parker and his Burnley side, we need to give a response after Wednesday night’s cup fixture.",
      "\"I can only say to our supporters that I am sorry. The better team on the night won the game and both what we showed, everybody has to do better. Today, we have to show intensity from the start. We need to go out onto the pitch and show how we are capable of playing, because the only way we fix this is by winning games.\"",

      "VAR finds itself under the microscope again after intervening to help disallow Fulham's opening goal at Chelsea - before they went on to lose 2-0 at their west London rivals.",
      "Joshua King thought he'd put the visitors ahead in the second-half before those celebrations were cut short. Rodrigo Muniz was deemed to have fouled Trevoh Chalobah as he tried to turn the Chelsea defender near the halfway line.",
      "The decision stunned plenty of onlookers with the Fulham star seemingly doing little wrong, leaving Marco Silva fuming. He attempted to confront referee Rob Jones before being waved away as his side were left to digest a difficult decision and result.",
      "The incident has drawn huge parallels to a penalty awarded to Manchester United at Aston Villa back in 2020. Bruno Fernandes, the man in possession, tried to turn Ezri Konsa, before placing his boot on the Villa man as he went down.",
      "On that occasion it was the United man who was awarded the penalty, much to the frustration of then Villa boss Dean Smith. So whilst the man in possession five years ago was awarded a penalty, now Muniz has been penalised and the lack of consistency is called out.",
      "Jones, the referee at Stamford Bridge, explained his decision after taking a look at the monitor and said: \"After review, the Fulham number nine commits a careless challenge, stands on the foot of the Chelsea defender, therefore we disallow the goal and we restart with a Chelsea free-kick.\"",
      "\"And I want to be on the bench in the next game, I don't want to pay fines, I want to help our players. But it has been difficult for us, this start of the season, with so many decisions that haven't come in the way they should.\"",
      "Rewind five years and Smith was equally fuming that his Villa side saw a penalty given against them. Referee Jon Moss gave the spot-kick and his decision was backed up by VAR official Graham Scott before the manager let rip.",
      "He said: \"I can understand Jon (Moss, referee) getting it wrong but I don't know what VAR are looking at - it's a disgraceful decision. They have a screen they can go and look at it but they don't seem to be bothered. Fernandes is trying a double drag back - his first touch is on the ball his second touch is on Ezri Konsa's shin. I won't tell you what I think...\"",

      "Here are how United's players rated in the first-half:",
      "Bayindir: Got the nod to start over Andre Onana and acquitted himself well. Assured with his feet when he needed to be and remained calm under pressure, although was hardly troubled. 6",
      "Yoro: Went close with a header early on and headed over midway through the first-half. Compsoed in defence and an aerial threat from set-pieces. 6",
      "De Ligt: Solid defensively and did enough to put Hannibal Mejbri off in the 37th minute, forcing the former United player to blaze a shot over he bar from close-range. 6",
      "Shaw: Got forward at the start of the first-half but was forced into more of a defensive role as the game went on. Looked sharp and alert, after last season's injury nightmare. 6",
      "Amad: Drew several fouls in the early stages and was frustrated none were punished with a caution. Linked up well with Mbeumo down the right side and saw a goalbound effort deflected over. 6",
      "Casemiro: Took the ball full in the face early on but recovered and played a key role in the opener, his header coming off the crossbar before cannoning back over the line off Josh Cullen. 7",
      "Fernandes: Still doesn't look as effective deployed in a deeper midfield role. But United scored the opener from his free-kick delivery and he played with his customary zeal. 7",
      "Dalot: Won the free-kick that led to United's opener, after out-pacing Kyle Walker to the ball and forcing the veteran defender into conceding a foul. 6",
      "Mount: Got involved in a spat with Walker. Won a penalty after a tussle with Walker but the decision was overturned. Impressive industry and passing range. Clipped bar with a header. 7",
      "Mbeumo: Twice went close to scoring in the early stages of the first-half, forcing a fine save from Dubravka with a curling left-foot shot and then firing just wide with an angled effort. 7",
      "Cunha: Made an impressive driving run towards the edge of the Burnley area early on, but shot straight at Dubravka. Was forced off with an injury after half-an-hour. 7",
      "Sub: Zirkzee (Cunha, 31): Made an impact straight away and caused problems for Burnley's defence.",

      "Just seconds after United took the lead against the newly-promoted Clarets, Cunha felt a problem. He went straight down the tunnel, and wasn't even treated by the physio before departing.",
      "His exit appeared to catch United boss Ruben Amorim off guard, as the home side didn't have a substitute ready to replace the former Wolves forward. Eventually, Joshua Zirkzee entered the fray.",
      "The only saving grace of the incident for United is that they're heading into an international week, and they're without a game for a fortnight. On the negative side, their next encounter is a Manchester derby against City at the Etihad.",
      "While United have struggled to get their season up and running, and were humiliated against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup, Cunha has started to settle and look the part. Handed the No.10 shirt at the club over the summer, he's expected to find his place as one of Amorim's twin No.10s in his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation, but has mostly been operating as the focal point of the club's attack since joining.",
      "And while he has been yet to score, there have been glimpses of the brilliance that made him a fans' favourite at Molineux and one of the Premier League's standout attackers last season - subsequently persuading United to splash the cash to bring him to Old Trafford.",

      "The Premier League's Match Centre has explained why Manchester United's penalty against Burnley was overturned in controversial fashion. In the opening stages of Saturday's clash, United midfielder Mason Mount looked to have been brought down Burnley right-back Kyle Walker and referee Sam Barrott pointed to the spot.",
      "That was despite Burnley's protests that the contact had ended outside of the penalty area. But after a VAR review and having been instructed to look at the pitch-side monitor, Barrott concluded that there was no foul - not even awarding a free-kick.",
      "The decision shocked the crowd, most of whom believed that even if it wasn't a penalty, United would be given a free-kick. A post on the Premier League's Match Centre account read: \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Manchester United.",
      "\"Referee announcement: \"After review, Burnley number two does not commit a foul on Man United number seven. My final decision is no penalty and drop ball to the goalkeeper\".\"",
      "Former Premier League defender Stephen Warnock described the incident was a '50-50', arguing that Walker was simply stronger than Mount. \"This is a 50-50 shoulder charge between the two, Mount and Walker, and Walker is simply too strong,\" Warnock claimed on Final Score.",
      "\"Mount tries to get his leg across for contact, but then he goes down as a last resort because he knows that he's losing the battle.It is the right decision. They have taken a while to get there but the officials have worked together and come to the right result.\"",

      "Manchester United won't be cashing in from Fulham's sale of Andreas Pereira to Palmeiras, as the Brazilian is leaving for the same £10million fee he was bought for. Pereira, who joined Old Trafford in 2012 after his 16th birthday, rose through the ranks at the Red Devils' academy.",
      "He made a bit of a breakthrough in 2019 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, following several loan spells. Despite signing a fresh four-year contract, he was loaned out to Lazio in 2020 and then to Flamengo the next season. With his game time in Manchester dwindling, Pereira permanently moved to Fulham in 2022 for a reported fee of £10m, with a 20 per cent sell-on clause included in his contract.",
      "After three years at the Cottagers, where he became an integral part of Marco Silva's team, Pereira is returning to Brazil. However, any hopes the Red Devils had of pocketing 20 per cent of any profit from his sale have been dashed, as Pereira has reportedly been sold for £10m once again.",
      "The 29-year-old had one year left on his Fulham contract. As Fulham didn't profit from this sale, United will not receive any windfall. Pereira's departure paves the way for young star Josh King, who has been starting as the No. 10 for the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Upon departing England, Pereira said: \"From the first day at Fulham, I felt at home. Thank you to my teammates, staff, and fans for every moment. After three years, I leave proud of what we achieved together. Fulham will always be part of me.\"",
      "Yet his recollections of his stint at Old Trafford may not be quite so cherished, as he made abundantly clear to Rio Ferdinand during a conversation last year.",
      "The Brazilian departed just as Erik ten Hag arrived, having swiftly recognised he wasn't included in the Dutchman's blueprint, and chose not to remain to discover whether his circumstances might improve.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, Pereira revealed: \"This was when I came back to England [after my loan to Flamengo]. Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old,\" he continued, referencing the period he spent within the Dutch club's academy system.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team.' But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United.'",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik [in 2022] because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here.'",
      "\"'You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad.' That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "He further stated: \"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave.\"",
      "During his tenure at the club, the Brazilian made a total of 75 appearances for United, netting four goals and providing five assists.",

      "Burnley thought they would leave Old Trafford with a point having twice equalised, but Amad was brought down in added time to win a penalty. Bruno Fernandes converted and Old Trafford breathed a sigh of relief at the whistle.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the game. Banners and flags were unfurled, and one flag had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction after Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the text. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around,\" to the tune of Bonnie Tyler.",
      "Amorim sounded like he was close to tendering his resignation after the Grimsby defeat. Some fans voiced understandable concerns about the 40-year-old, but he still retains support from matchgoing fans.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee quickly picked up the ball while VAR decided whether to award a late penalty to United. The Dutchman handed it over to Fernandes, who paced around the box as he tried to focus his mind.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham last weekend and atoned for that miss to secure an important three points. It was only a win against Burnley, but it was crucial after the Grimsby debacle.",
      "United's captain screamed in relief at full-time and was embraced by Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had enough chances to put the result beyond doubt in the first half. But they never make it easy for themselves and could not extend their advantage.",
      "Burnley equalised in the 55th minute, but Mbeumo produced an immediate response to score his first goal for United. Mbeumo was mobbed by his attacking colleagues, while Amorim did not raise a smile. He knew there was more work to do and buried his head in his hands shortly afterwards when Fernandes dragged a shot wide.",
      "United's head coach knew his side needed a two-goal lead because, more often than not, they allow their opponent back into the contest. And Amorim's fears were realised when Jaidon Anthony scored to make it 2-2.",
      "The cameras in the press box showed Omar Berrada looking unhappy in the directors' box. Amorim subsequently blew out his cheeks and could hardly watch as Fernandes stepped up to convert a late penalty.",
      "Shortly after United opened the scoring against Burnley, Cunha went down with an injury.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee were sent to warm up. Cunha returned to the dressing room with what seemed to be a hamstring issue and was consoled by the substitutes at the tunnel entrance.",
      "Cunha was applauded by supporters as he headed down the tunnel and his body language hinted he might be out for several weeks, which would be a huge blow for United.",
      "The Brazilian has made a strong impression since signing from Wolves. It felt like only a matter of time before Cunha would score his first United goal, but it seems he will be unavailable in the coming weeks.",
      "Mount had a brilliant five minutes in the first half. He tracked back to recover the ball to create a chance for Mbeumo and did the same moments later when setting up the Cameroon international again.",
      "Mbeumo came close to scoring on both occasions but could not find the back of the net, so Mount took matters into his own hands minutes later and made a piercing run into the Burnley penalty area.",
      "Kyle Walker appeared to bring Mount to the ground and the referee pointed for a penalty. Mount celebrated winning the spot kick to the Stretford End, but his celebrations were premature.",
      "The incident was reviewed by VAR. The referee announced it was not a foul when the presumption was it had been reviewed to determine whether it was a penalty or a free-kick. It was a bizarre decision from VAR and Mount deserved something for his good work.",
      "Mount was excellent in the first half but was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval. Mount must have picked up an injury because, based on his performance, Amorim wouldn't have brought him off.",
      "Mainoo's future has made headlines this week. The youngster's contract situation has stalled and there are doubts about where he fits into Amorim's system, so it's not a surprise that he wants to leave on loan.",
      "The academy graduate wants minutes and Amorim has said he is challenging Fernandes for a place in the starting team. Fans are concerned that Mainoo could eventually leave on a permanent basis and Old Trafford gave a deliberately loud cheer for the 20-year-old when he was introduced.",

Amorim has watched his goalkeepers make mistakes against Arsenal, Grimsby and Burnley this term, but defended his 'keepers after the win over the Clarets, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side.",

We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",

      "\"And then you can see the first minutes of the game. You can understand, you can compare this to Wednesday, and you can feel it. It's not about playing well.",
      "\"The sound of the fans when we are pressing and winning balls and corners, and you sprint to get a corner, you sprint to get a throw in, it's nothing to do with the tactical and technical aspects. So today, I just need to watch sometimes the first minutes to understand the mindset of the team.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"The important thing is that if you take Wednesday, we were more consistent in the performance compared to last year. That is a good thing. But I'm not thinking about turning point.",
      "\"I had this conversation with you guys like 10 times. So I'm not, it's day by day. I'm happy. We return, sometimes playing well or not so well.",
      "\"We return a little bit to think that we should be competitive, creating chances, we need to score. Sometimes we block the opponent in their half, we press really high. So we have a lot to do, but we return a little bit to our level today.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo was \"really happy\" to score his first goal for Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo was signed for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons, from Brentford this summer. The forward notched 20 goals in the Premier League last season and got off the mark in the top flight for United against Burnley.",
      "The Cameroon international scored with a simple finish to make it 2-1 in the second half, netting almost immediately after Lyle Foster had equalised for Burnley at the Stretford End.",
      "\"I feel very good, obviously. I think today was really important that we could win,\" Mbeumo told MUTV.",
      "\"I'm really happy to score my first goal here. We had a lot of chances in the first half, but yeah, I think we kept going in the game and we got our reward at the end.",
      "\"It was really important to give us confidence and helps me prepare for the national team.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mbeumo was asked about getting the win for Ruben Amorim and responded: \"We are all a team, it is not only one person. We all worked very hard for the win today.\"",
      "During his post-match press conference, Amorim praised Mbeumo's contribution after missing a penalty against Grimsby. \"It was impressive, the way he (Mbeumo) stretched the team, the quality he has in the first touch,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can feel that we are a different team, because when we win the ball, we have one guy stretching the team. Last season we struggled a little bit with that.",
      "\"And then you can see the first minutes of the game. You can understand, you can compare this to Wednesday, and you can feel it. It's not about playing well.",
      "\"The sound of the fans when we are pressing and winning balls and corners, and you sprint to get a corner, you sprint to get a throw in, it's nothing to do with the tactical and technical aspects.",
      "\"So today, I just need to watch sometimes the first minutes to understand the mindset of the team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United beat Burnley 3-2 in their final Premier League fixture before the September internationals.",
      "A Josh Cullen own goal gave United a deserved lead in the first half but their failure to take chances cost them as Lyle Foster equalised for Burnley 10 minutes into the second half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo immediately regained United's lead but yet another Altay Bayindir error gifted Burnley a second equaliser through Jaidon Anthony.",
      "But Bruno Fernandes stepped up to convert an added time penalty and give United their first win of the campaign.",
      "Here are how the players and manager rated:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Recalled and a spectator for the entirety of the first half. However, he spilt a shot from a corner to allow Jaidon Anthony to make it 2-2. 4",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "As slick on the ball as the turf in the rainy conditions, doubtless helped by his midweek rest. Nowhere near Lyle Foster for the equaliser. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Closed down Hannibal Mejbri quickly enough to ensure he did not have a clear shot at goal. Like his fellow centre halves, left Foster unmarked. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "The other defender not scarred from the Grimsby Town debacle, Shaw was urgent and drifted wide to double as a left back at times. 6",
      "Amad",
      "A huge improvement on his tentative midweek performance. Drove at Burnley constantly and came close to scoring from a corner. Faded after the pause but won the penalty. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "His header off the crossbar rebounded in off Cullen to give United the lead. A clear upgrade on Manuel Ugarte. Came off for Benjamin Sesko. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Regularly involved and teed up Amad for a volley at goal from a first-half corner. Booked for a needless sliding tackle as frustration got the better of him. Scored the added-time penalty. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Switched to the left wing at the expense of the dropped Patrick Dorgu and his movement infield gave United another outlet. Did well for Bryan Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "The best player on the pitch in the first half and so athletic he outpaced Kyle Walker. For the third August running, he got injured. Off at half-time. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "His first touch is one of the most delicate since Dimitar Berbatov's and Mbeumo went close to a first Old Trafford goal until he put United 2-1 up. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Forced off in the first half with a hamstring injury, having begun quite brightly as the de facto centre forward in United's strikerless system. 6",
      "Subs",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Had a good chance before half-time and played a key role in Mbeumo's goal. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Has some brass neck to want out when he can't get in the worst United team in 51 years. Lackadaisical. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Went close with a header. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Returned from injury. 6",
      "Manager",
      "Made the right calls in the right positions and United were fluid again without a striker starting. Injuries disrupted United. 6",

      "Hello and welcome to our live updates on the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and gossip on Saturday, August 30.",
      "The summer transfer window is due to officially shut on Monday (September 1) at 7pm. United know they need to move quickly to wrap up any remaining deals - and it seems their next summer signing could be just around the corner.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens looks set to make his switch to M16 after missing his team's match against Westerlo on Saturday. The 22-year-old is expected to complete a £17million transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "This purchase is likely to cast further uncertainty over the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır. United had also been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper now appears set for Manchester City.",
      "The Reds have also been heavily linked with a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, although Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has once again insisted that the Cameroonian is not departing.",
      "In other news, Reds skipper Bruno Fernandes continues to be a target for clubs in Saudi Arabia, while the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Rasmus Hojlund remain uncertain.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "Manchester United are reportedly preparing a surprise £40million offer for Aston Villa's goalkeeper Emi Martinez. The Reds had previously passed up the opportunity to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer, deeming the deal too costly when his £200,000-a-week wages were considered.",
      "Instead, United turned their attention to Royal Antwerp's highly sought-after young goalkeeper Senne Lammens, having outbid several top European competitors for his £20million signature. It was anticipated that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening's transfer deadline.",
      "The 23-year-old is viewed as the successor to Thibaut Courtois as Belgium's No. 1. However, United now appear ready to approve an expensive short-term solution with Martinez rather than plan for the future.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was \"really happy\" to score his first goal for Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo was signed for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons, from Brentford this summer. The forward notched 20 goals in the Premier League last season and got off the mark in the top flight for United against Burnley.",

      "The Brazilian has been training away from United's first team this summer after asking to leave Old Trafford. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis, scoring nine goals and providing five assists in 26 appearances.",
      "Read more here",
      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United this morning.",
      "The Reds finally got their first win of the season yesterday with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford. Those three points will come as a relief to Ruben Amorim and his team.",
      "And attention will now be on the final few days of the summer transfer window. United are likely to be more busy with outgoings but more new additions cannot be ruled out.",
      "Stick with us throughout the day for all the latest.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has completed his move to Chelsea and has signed a long-term contract at the club.",
      "The Blues have paid around £35m for the winger.",
      "We will bring you the reaction...",
      "The Mirror claims Napoli have prepared a four-year contract for Mainoo, who has reputedly informed United that he wants a permanent move to Serie A.",
      "However, United have so far resisted the deal, wary of a repeat of Scott McTominay’s remarkable resurgence after leaving the club.",
      "Elsewhere, Fabrizio Romano claims that Mainoo once again asked United about the possibility of a loan move in the final 48 hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein has provided an update on Lammens.",
      "Ornstein said: \"Lammens is a player of interest but it's not as advanced as some people have suggested. They've also got an issue there, can they move on Andre Onana, it doesn't look like it.",
      "\"Altay Bayindir, possibly, so that's one to watch before the deadline.\"",
      "Hojlund is set to join Napoli on a season-long, with includes an obligation to buy.",
      "Hojlund was axed from Ruben Amorim's plans despite featuring in pre-season. Speaking in the USA, Hojlund outlined his desire to fight for his place but was subsequently omitted from the squad against Arsenal, Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "Read more here.",
      "ABC Sevilla report that after a preliminary agreement on €25m, Man United requested that Betis cover an additional €6m, believed to be owed to Antony and his agents.",
      "They add that Betis will not resubmit their offer until Antony and United have reached an agreement on the €6m, and they do not wish to be involved in those discussions. Meanwhile, Estadio Deportivo wrote: \"Just when the negotiation was considered finalised, everything went up in smoke again due to a small print regarding amounts owed to the Brazil international that Old Trafford is trying to foist on the Verdiblancos, a position they are, quite literally, incapable of assuming.Everyone is confident that it will eventually happen, but the news as of August 30th is that there is still no agreement.\"",
      "Sport Mediaset report that Sancho appears unlikely to play again in 2025.",
      "They suggest he could remain at Old Trafford beyond the summer window, even though he is aware he would have little to no chance of featuring under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking to the media on Friday, relayed by TuttoMercatoWeb, he said: \"Call him if you have his number… You know everything, I don’t know what the margins are now. We don’t have to beg anyone, ever: it applies to everyone, Sancho is a possibility, but we are a possibility for him. If they don’t think so, he’ll stay where he is.\"",
      "Sport Mediaset adds that the manager’s comments were the ‘final nail in the coffin’ for Sancho, but the Serie A club have other plans. Roma are said to be 'making one last push to sign him' and are expected to contact his agent within the next few hours.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says a verbal agreement between all parties has been reached for the transfer of Hojlund to Napoli.",
      "\"Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli, here we go!,\" he wrote on X. \"Verbal agreement done between all parties involved.",
      "\"Loan deal for €6m fee with buy option clause to become mandatory under certain conditions worth €44m. Hojlund said yes to Napoli days ago, set for medical in next 24h.\"",
      "Sesko, along with several other Man United players, has dropped a team news hint ahead of their clash with Burnley.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are still in search of their first victory in the Premier League following a defeat and draw to Arsenal and Fulham respectively. The match at Old Trafford will be their final one before the September international break.",
      "Ahead of this afternoon's match, Sesko has posted a pre-match graphic preview of the fixture to his Instagram story. Historically this suggests that the 22-year-old striker, whom United signed from RB Leipzig, will be involved in some capacity.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Inter Milan have reportedly joined the race to sign Jadon Sancho. TEAMtalkclaim the Italian giants are looking to reinforce their attack before the window closes.",
      "The 25-year-old has been linked with AS Roma recently, but he has yet to complete his move to Italy. Sancho is currently training away from United's first team with the former Borussia Dortmund star keen to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Read more here",
      "Had the clash with Grimsby gone according to plan from the start, there is a strong likelihood Bryan Mbeumo would have remained on the bench. However, Amorim had to call upon him at half-time and he got United back into the game with his first goal for the club.",
      "Fellow summer signings Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko started at Blundell Park, highlighting the level of quality United had on the pitch, but they were, just like the rest of their teammates, largely ineffective.",
      "Nevertheless, they have been brought to Old Trafford to try and increase United's attacking output, meaning Amorim must persevere with them. With that said, the time has come for him to deploy Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko as a front-three from the start for the first time.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have just a week left to strengthen their squad before the summer transfer window closes at 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "It may be early days in the 2025/26 campaign, but all evidence so far suggests that the Reds still have plenty of work to do. That will surprise few after such a disastrous campaign last term, and yet the scale of United's rebuild often causes astonishment.",
      "The key areas that need filling are goalkeeper and a new central midfielder, with both positions exposed in the two Premier League matches Ruben Amorim's side have played so far. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both struggled over the last year or so, and there will be hope that Senne Lammens can step up if his move from Royal Antwerp is completed.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United forward Antony has posted an update on social media as his move to Real Betis stalls.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United have no intention of letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club.",
      "The MEN reported that United will resist any efforts by Mainoo to secure a loan transfer before Monday's 7pm deadline.",
      "United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho for £40million to Chelsea while Rasmus Hojlund and Antony are expected to join Napoli and Real Betis in loan moves.",
      "Read more here",
      "\"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer,\" the statement read.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is being linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer.",
      "Mainoo broke through as one of Europe's brightest talents under Erik ten Hag in 2023/24. The midfielder scored in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City before earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 where he started in the final against Spain.",
      "But the 20-year-old has struggled for game time since Ruben Amorim replaced Ten Hag at Old Trafford in November last year. The Reds academy graduate has yet to start for Amorim's men in the Premier League this season and struggled like most of his teammates in Wednesday's shock League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are in the market for a new midfielder and Brighton star Carlos Baleba is said to be their top target.",
      "However, the Seagulls are demanding more than £100m for the 21-year-old and Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler believes Baleba will not be going anywhere this summer. When asked is he is 100 per cent confident the player will stay, he replied: \"Yes.",
      "\"If there is a number more than 100 - I would even say more than 100. I am confident, yes.\"",
      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage this morning.",
      "The Reds return to action this afternoon at home to Burnley as they chase their first win of the season. United were awful at Grimsby Town in midweek, and many will be expecting a response at home to a newly promoted side.",
      "And there are only a few days left for the Reds to strengthen their squad with transfer deadline day fast approaching. The window slams shut on Monday at 7pm UK time.",
      "Keep across our live blog throughout the day with all the latest from Old Trafford!",
      "BBC Sport’s Simon Stone reports that sources at Real Betis say the club have withdrawn their offer for Antony.",
      "The decision is reportedly due to financial constraints, with Betis unable to cover the transfer fee or the wages the player is set to receive.",
      "It remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming hours.",
      "Juan Sebastian Veron previously confessed he regrets his transfer from Manchester United to Chelsea as Alejandro Garnacho finalises a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "After weeks of negotiations, United have finally struck an agreement with Chelsea in a deal worth £40million. Blues head coach Enzo Maresca confirmed on Friday that Garnacho was at Cobham to undergo a medical and finalise his move.",
      "The winger is poised to become the club's seventh summer signing, excluding loaned-out players, and will compete with Pedro Neto and fellow newcomer Jamie Gittens for a spot on the flank, while striker Joao Pedro and Brazilian teenager Estevao Willian are also capable of playing out wide",
      "Read more here.",
      "The total deal is reportedly valued at over £43million, with United waiting for Hojlund to finalise personal terms with the Italian giants.",
      "Man United expect at least three players to leave before the transfer window closes on Monday night.",
      "United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea for £40million while loan moves for Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli and Antony to Real Betis are at an advanced stage. United have inserted a 10% sell-on clause in the deal for Garnacho, who will become the club's fourth-most expensive departure after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel di Maria. Garnacho is about to trump Scott McTominay as United's largest academy sale.",
      "Napoli initially proposed a straight loan move for Hojlund but United have insisted that an obligation to buy be included in the deal. Hojlund, 22, has been omitted from all three of United's squads so far this season.",
      "Antony is poised to return to Betis, where he spent the second half of last season on loan, in the absence of a willing buyer. Sancho identified Italy as his likeliest exit route and held discussions with Juventus before Roma expressed their interest.",
      "Garnacho, Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been training separately from the first team squad at United's Carrington training complex.",
      "Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini has admitted a move for Jadon Sancho is 'a possibility' ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.",

      "\"It's certainly a possibility, but it's also a huge opportunity for them. If you think like this, it becomes an advantage for everyone, otherwise not. If he understands it, it makes sense, otherwise he'll stay where he is.\"",
      "The winger has reportedly been given permission to travel to Spain, with discussions now to focus on Antony and Betis agreeing personal terms."

      "Cunha went down in the first half during Saturday's 3-2 Premier League win over the Clarets and was replaced by Joshua Zirkee, with Sesko remaining on the bench.",
      "The Slovenia striker did come on in the second period, replacing Casemiro with just under 20 minutes remaining. Amorim's handling of Sesko has also been a talking point this season. United paid big money to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig, but the striker has yet to start in a Premier League fixture.",

      "\"So he finished the [Grimsby] game with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties,\" explained Amorim.",
      "\"And today was that reason also, because (Joshua) Zirkzee is also a striker, he's an international striker. But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",

      "Garnacho's move to Chelsea has been expected for most of the summer and the Blues have been long-term admirers of the 21-year-old.",
      "He joins on a seven-year-contract and the deal includes a 10 per cent sell on for United.",
      "After securing the switch Garnacho said: \"It;s an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club.",
      "\"I can't wait to get started. I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\"",
      "The Argentina international moved to Old Trafford in 2020 as a 16-year-old and he helped the Reds win the FA Youth Cup in 2022.",
      "He broke through into the first-team the following season and seemed set for a bright future with the Reds.",
      "But he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and has been training away from the first-team this summer as part of the United 'bomb squad'.",
      "His departure will count as pure profit for United under the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) as Garnacho counts as a homegrown player.",
      "Garnacho cast doubt on his future after he was benched for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in May and Amorim told him three days later he could leave United.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby at City in December over his attitude in the 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen three days earlier. Garnacho was then selected in the next 34 matchday squads before he was omitted from the 20-man selection on the final day of the season against Aston Villa.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly preparing a surprise £40million offer for Aston Villa's goalkeeper Emi Martinez. The Reds had previously passed up the opportunity to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer, deeming the deal too costly when his £200,000-a-week wages were considered.",
      "Instead, United turned their attention to Royal Antwerp's highly sought-after young goalkeeper Senne Lammens, having outbid several top European competitors for his £20million signature. It was anticipated that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening's transfer deadline.",
      "The 23-year-old is viewed as the successor to Thibaut Courtois as Belgium's No. 1. However, United now appear ready to approve an expensive short-term solution with Martinez rather than plan for the future.",
      "Martinez, who turns 33 on Tuesday, has been seen as a risky investment due to his age and volatile temperament, prompting Villa to consider cashing in. United believe that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a risk they must take, despite the club already spending over £200million on new signings this summer and flirting with PSR problems, reports the Mirror.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim reportedly lacks confidence in £43m Andre Onana or Turkish back-up Altay Bayindir. Onana was dropped from United's team for the 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford following a shaky performance in the unexpected Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby in midweek.",
      "However, Bayindir, who was responsible for Fulham's equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last week, made another mistake when the Clarets equalised for a second time. Intriguingly, Villa themselves are attempting a last-minute deal to bring West Ham's Lucas Paqueta to the West Midlands.",
      "Unai Emery has been urging club officials to bolster his squad, but due to PSR issues, the Villans haven't been able to make the additions the Spaniard desired. However, having already profited from the sale of homegrown midfielder Jacob Ramsey, offloading Martinez in the next 36 hours will provide them with some financial relief moving forward, even as they aim to secure Paqueta.",
      "They've been in discussions about a loan move with a £50m transfer obligation next summer, and while the Brazilian international is eager for the move, West Ham aren't satisfied with the current terms.",
      "If Villa could pay more upfront and make the transfer permanent immediately, it would be beneficial. A new goalkeeper is also likely to join, although Emery might be content to let veteran stopper Marco Bizot take charge until January if they can't secure the replacement for Martinez they're after.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will assess injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount after winning against Burnley.",
      "Cunha was forced off in the first half against the Clarets with what seemed to be a hamstring injury. Mount was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval after also picking up an injury.",
      "Speaking at his post-match press conference, United boss Ruben Amorim provided an update on the pair and said: \"I don't know [how they are]. We'll check them. We need those guys really bad to be competitive.\"",
      "United crashed out of the Carabao Cup against Grimsby Town earlier in the week. That result increased the pressure on Amorim and meant a positive result against Burnley was required before the international break.",
      "Burnley twice fought back after falling behind and looked to be on course for a draw, but Amad was brought down in the box in added time and Bruno Fernandes converted the late penalty.",
      "\"I think we deserved in the end to win the game,\" said Amorim. \"We created a lot of chances and should have gone to half-time with a bigger advantage. And then everything in this moment, every possession near our box, they can score from that moment, so it's tough always chasing a lot of things.",
      "\"But we tried until the last minute to score goals and had our chances. In the end, we deserved the win.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"When they [the players] put the effort, I will always love them. I think we need to understand that we should always be on this level of effort.",
      "\"Because even in the game, we played well at the beginning and then struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match was not so perfect.",
      "\"And you can feel the team struggle a little bit, especially in the second half, but the effort was always there and we tried to put the ball in the box. We tried to put more people in the box, not just around the box to play the ball.",
      "\"Some of the things that we worked on and spoke about during the week were that they were doing that and focused on the game, which is the most important thing.\"",
      "United will take on Manchester City when the Premier League resumes after the international break.",

      "A banner unfurled in the Stretford End before kick-off read, 'The good days are coming'. This was one of them for Manchester United.",
      "Undone by a penalty in midweek, United were spot on this time. It was the fourth spot kick Bruno Fernandes had taken within seven days and this was one of the biggest pressure-penalties he will have ever converted.",
      "After the Video Assistant Referee denied United a spot kick in the first half, it offered them deliverance in added time.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee fetched the ball while the check was ongoing. Fernandes accepted the ball calmly and paced around the penalty area, determined that his routine not be upset, as it was at Fulham. Amid the din at its award, Zirkzee urged the crowd to remain calm when all they could chant was \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\".. They then chanted it again, only euphorically.",
      "This time, United defended their one-goal advantage. Diogo Dalot brazenly over celebrated a goal kick. Fernandes did likewise and barged into an appalled Lyle Foster.",
      "It should not have been this taxing. United were so dominant against promoted Burnley that they racked up 20 more shots. Burnley scored twice from their six efforts.",
      "As much as United attempted to avoid the unnecessary drama, the nervy manner of victory could lift them when their season resumes with the derby in a fortnight.",
      "Eerie parallels were developing with the last season United had no European football 11 years ago. They had lost their opening home game, drawn their first away match and gone out of the League Cup in the second round. They were minutes away from drawing with Burnley in their fourth fixture.",
      "While United are busy attempting to shift their Jadon and Antony before Monday's transfer deadline, they will be grateful to Jaidon Anthony of Burnley. His tug on Amad was retrospectively deemed to warrant a penalty.",
      "Bar the win, this season still feels like an extension of last. United's goalkeeper is dropping dollies and the forwards' conversion rate has barely improved. Unlike against Arsenal, plenty of supporters headed down the gangways to make an early exit long before full-time. They should know better.",
      "It is a quirk of this new United that they are at their most enterprising without a striker on, yet still hardly ever score. For the second week running, an own goal put them ahead and Bryan Mbeumo's strike is their only goal from open play in four-and-a-half hours in the Premier League.",
      "The United chief executive, Omar Berrada, looked agitated as the clock ticked towards the 90-minute mark. Ruben Amorim appeared permanently dissatisfied as attempt after attempt hit anything but the back of the net.",
      "Amorim admitted on Friday that he sometimes \"hates\" his players. He must have done so at times again. He suggested United players dwell on the past too much. Even their worst side in 51 years serves up late finales.",
      "When United regained the lead through Mbeumo for 2-1, Amorim shook his head while all those around him celebrated, clearly disgruntled that United were only that ruthless following Burnley's equaliser.",
      "As Amorim waited in the tunnel before kick-off, the Stretford End broke into a chorus of his chant. It was conspicuous by its absence at Grimsby yet returned loudly. The aforementioned banner bore the silhouette of Amorim.",
      "The hosts ought to have been out of sight by the time they returned indoors for the half-time oranges. Pleasingly for United's deal-makers, Mbeumo, bought to sharpen the attack, was clinical.",
      "For Mbeumo, it was the desired response to his costly penalty miss at Grimsby on Wednesday night. He has otherwise had an auspicious start at United, creating and scoring chances.",
      "Amorim donned a bomber jacket but there will not be any artillery to shield from over the international fortnight. He refused to promise he would be in charge next month but it seems a safer bet than to lump money on his removal.",
      "Not only was this a good day but United were good to watch. Particularly in the first half. Burnley have quickly learnt that their miserly defensive record last year counts for nought.",
      "Altay Bayindir was back between the posts and culpable for another goal. Four of the six United have shipped this month have been 'keeper errors. It remains possible that that department will not be strengthened before 7pm on Monday.",
      "Ironically, Burnley had more hassle at corners. Casemiro and Mason Mount struck the crossbar while Fernandes and Amad almost recreated David Beckham and Paul Scholes's corner routine at Bradford City 25 years ago.",
      "United's flow was interrupted by the premature withdrawal of the hamstrung Matheus Cunha on 30 minutes. United physio Jordan Reece offered Cunha a consolatory pat as he headed down the tunnel.",
      "That was compounded by the removal of the influential Mount at the pause. Last August, Mount excelled in the first half at Brighton, went off injured at the interval and never truly recovered over the course of the season. He has sustained an injury in August in each of his three seasons with United.",
      "With Cunha out of sight, Amorim was still mulling over his replacement. He consulted his staff before instructing assistant Carlos Fernandes to summon Zirkzee, rather than Benjamin Sesko.",
      "As damningly as that reflected on Sesko, United had been fluid and threatening with three No.10s up front. Amorim considers Zirkzee to be of that ilk and the Dutchman offered some silky touches.",
      "Still, this was Zirkzee's first Premier League appearance since April 13 and Sesko had at least an hour across the Arsenal and Fulham matches. Sesko was not needed until Anthony equalised.",
      "New season, new guidelines but the same unfathomable officials. The one indisputable issue with Mount's first-half tangle with Kyle Walker on the edge of the area seemed to be that a foul had been committed. Not for the Video Assistant Referee, who recommended a review. On-pitch referee Sam Barrott decided one had not been.",
      "Diogo Dalot had handed the ball to Fernandes upon the initial award of a penalty. Fernandes then headed over to where Mount was supposedly felled to take a free kick. He got neither.",
      "He did in Fergie time.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has backed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and called for optimism, hoping some stern words were had and fines handed out after the club's FA Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "After valiantly losing their opening Premier League clash against Arsenal 1-0, many expected a new-look United side, buoyed by the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, to improve on their 15th-placed finish last time out. However, Amorim's men have made a slow start, and concerns were raised following their 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "A few days after that result, in what was an upset for the ages, they exited the FA Cup on penalties to Grimsby. On Saturday, a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty rescued them from yet another disappointing result, as they beat Burnley 3-2, slightly quenching talk of manager Amorim being given the boot.",
      "Ferdinand, who made 455 appearances for the Red Devils, chimed in on calls for Amorim to be sacked before the Burnley match. Though he advocated for conflict in the dressing room, admitting tongue in cheek that he would expect some fines, the 46-year-old nailed his colours to Amorim's mast and remains optimistic about the Portuguese manager's tenure.",
      "\"I'm hoping that in the changing room, he [Amorim] has had some choice words with those players, someone's been strangled, someone's been put in a headlock, someone's been fined,\" began Ferdinand, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel.",
      "\"I'd like to think there's been some really, really solid hard conversations had, almost fights. I don't mind a fight, have one. Because I think moments like that, when it's on edge, when emotions are running high, when people are feeling embarrassed...",
      "\"There's been a lot of people talking, saying 'Oh, Ruben Amorim, give him the sack now.' Before a ball was kicked, everyone was optimistic, and I'm the same. Optimistic and hopeful. I'm hopeful that we're gonna improve.\"",
      "\"You can't sack someone after three games; it doesn't make sense,\" he continued, speaking before the Burnley win. \"You've allowed them to invest in three new strikers, and you're going to say after three games, when they're not even fully fit, that you're going to sack someone.",
      "\"It doesn't make sense to me. I don't see INEOS doing that. No way. I can't see it. They're more sensible than that. There are emotional people who pay good, hard-earned money who deserve to be entertained and deserve better performances and results. I get that.",
      "\"We all feel like that. But let's not be stupid. Let's not jump on the bandwagon and start getting all emotional about it, and say 'Right, I'm gonna start a vendetta.'",
      "\"Yes, there have been bad results, but when you try to turn things around at football clubs, especially one the size of Manchester United, that's been in turmoil and on a downward spiral for many years now, 10 or 12 years, do you think it's going to take six months or a year to turn that around? No. If we just keep changing managers every six months or every year, it's going to be the same thing for the next twenty years.\"",
      "Many have questioned Amorim's tactics and unrelenting use of wide wing-backs, but Ferdinand does not buy into any criticism of the head coach's lack of formational change, as he added: \"The formation has been an issue for a lot of people. 'Should there be some flexibility in that?'",
      "\"But this manager will tell you, 'Yeah, we may start with three at the back. But there are moments in the game that we are playing four at the back, and we're shifting round.' It changes in terms of shape in and out of possession.",
      "\"I think you've got to allow the club to go through a period of pain if we feel there's a chance to get through the other side, and you're gonna see some sunlight. If you're allowing the manager to spend the money that we have, allowing him to let people go, then there has to be an element of patience through turmoil, and that's where we are right now.\"",
      "Following a tough few days, Amorim's men were able to close out the week on a high after narrowly claiming three points over Burnley. Despire twice surrendering a one-goal lead, Fernandes stepped up in the dying embers to slot the winning goal from the spot and seal the club's first victory of the season.",
      "However, one downside was the injury to Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian was forced off in the first half with what seemed to be a hamstring injury but the extent of his problem is not yet known.",
      "Speaking after the final whistle, Amorim admitted his concern at the forward's injury. \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" the United head coach said.",
      "Asked if they were long-term issues, he replied: \"I don't know, I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United’s sharp decline in the years since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement has only strengthened his legacy as arguably the greatest manager in the history of English football.",
      "Not only have United not won a Premier League title since the Scot stepped down in 2013, but chaos among the club hierarchy and woeful performances on the pitch have gradually chipped away at the aura Ferguson intricately cultivated. A key part of that has been poor recruitment, with the Red Devils tending to overpay for players in recent years who have simply not delivered.",
      "United fans will hope that’s not the case after splashing over £200million on fresh talent this summer, though the signs until now have not exactly been encouraging.",
      "With that in mind, we will now take a look at the most expensive players Ferguson signed during his 27-year tenure. And while it is easy to look back on all of his signings with rose-tinted glasses, there were certainly some flops among the many blockbuster names...",
      "Nani faced the unfortunate burden of constantly being compared to Cristiano Ronaldo following his move from Sporting CP in 2007. The Portuguese winger was electric on his day and today would no doubt be seen as one of the Premier League's most competent wingers.",
      "But he never managed to consistently play at his top level and frustrated Sir Alex on a number of occasions. Still, he won four Premier League titles and the Champions League, leaving the club in 2015. He's now working on his Nani Football Academy near Lisbon.",
      "The Brazilian joined in 2007 from Porto as a bit of an unknown. He served the club for eight years, though he only played more than 20 league games in his very first season due to repeated injuries.",
      "Anderson therefore goes down as one of the more peculiar Ferguson signings - blessed with talent but ultimately a disappointment. Since retiring, he's worked as assistant manager of Adana Demirspor.",
      "Ecuadorian winger Valencia was signed after impressing Ferguson at Wigan Athletic. While £16m may seem a fairly modest transfer fee in this day and age, at the time it was a fairly big sum to pay.",
      "Having said that, Valencia proved to be exceptional value for the money. He spent a decade at Old Trafford and played over 300 times, initially as a right winger before being converted to a right-back. Valencia even captained the side under Jose Mourinho before moving abroad in 2019. He too has moved into coaching in retirement.",
      "The Canada-born midfielder’s career was hampered by injuries and his time in the Premier League was no different, with Hargreaves managing only 39 appearances across a four-year stint for the Red Devils. He had a brief spell at Manchester City after leaving United but played just one Premier League match before being released.",
      "Carrick, most recently the head coach of Middlesbrough, was already considered one of England's best technical midfielders when he was signed by United - and it’s fair to say he lived up to the hype.",
      "The ex-West Ham and Tottenham midfielder evolved as a player over the years after joining in 2006 and even captained the side in the latter stages of his career. Carrick won five Premier League titles and the Champions League, cementing his place as a club legend by the time he hung up his boots after 12 years at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite his nervy start to life at United, De Gea’s arrival in 2011 ended up being a stroke of genius by Fergie. The current Fiorentina star would go on to become one of the greatest goalkeepers in the club’s history, winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award four times.",
      "He made 545 appearances in total before departing in the summer of 2023, having been a formidable force in goal during his peak years. When it comes to value for money, few on this list can match the longevity and success of De Gea.",
      "During his five years at United, Van Nistelrooy was an unstoppable goal machine. Arriving from PSV Eindhoven for a then-British record fee in 2001, the biggest compliment one can pay the Dutchman is that he seamlessly succeeded Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole.",
      "His time at United was not blessed with silverware as it coincided with a rebuilding phase for the club, with Arsenal and Chelsea instead sharing the spoils. However, Van Nistelrooy still managed a hugely impressive 150 goals in 219 games, winning the Premier League in 2002/03 and the FA Cup in 2003/04. He got the chance to manage his former club on an interim basis after Erik ten Hag's departure last year before a lacklustre spell in charge of Leicester City, who he couldn't save from relegation.",
      "Stealing Arsenal captain Van Persie right from under their noses made the Dutch striker one of United's most controversial signings of the Fergie era. But fans quickly forgot about his past as the current Feyenoord boss became an Old Trafford favourite, revered to this day for his debut 2012/2013 season.",
      "He netted a whopping 30 goals that year on his way to winning the league for Ferguson at his final attempt, making him a bargain at only £24m. Van Persie would continue to lead the line for United for another two years before moving to Fenerbahce.",
      "Rooney was one of English football's hottest prospects when he joined United for a whopping £27m fee from his boyhood club, Everton, as a mere teenager. But Ferguson and his squad knew even then that he was a special player.",
      "The England star became United's all-time leading goalscorer during his 13-year stay at Old Trafford, netting 253 goals in 559 appearances to eclipse all those who had come before him at the Theatre of Dreams. His managerial career hasn't lived up to his playing days, though, with Rooney now working as a pundit on Match of the Day for the BBC.",
      "There are few misses on this list but Veron’s £28m transfer to United has justifiably gone down as one. The midfielder became England's most expensive player back in 2001 but failed to live up to expectations during his time at the club.",
      "Having struggled to replicate the dazzling form he showcased in Italy, he made 82 appearances, winning the Premier League before joining Chelsea after two seasons. Veron is still widely acknowledged as Ferguson's biggest blunder when it comes to transfer dealings. He is currently the chairman of Estudiantes de La Plata in his native Argentina.",
      "Ferdinand became both the most expensive defender in the world and the most expensive British footballer in history when he crossed the divide from United's bitter rivals, Leeds, in 2002.",
      "It was money well spent, though, with Ferdinand going on to establish himself as one of the finest defenders of his generation. He spent 12 years at Old Trafford and made over 450 appearances before moving back to London to see out his career.",
      "Ferdinand's imperious partnership with Nemanja Vidic was the platform that enabled United to win the 2008 Champions League and numerous other trophies during some of the best years of Ferguson's lengthy reign. He now discusses his former club at length on his YouTube channel, departing TNT at the end of last season.",
      "The now-pundit, despite his easy-going and sometimes frustrating approach, was a big hit at Tottenham and was eventually prised away to add to United's firepower. He scored 56 goals in 149 appearances for the Red Devils on his way to securing two league titles across a four-year stint, before moving back to the capital with Fulham."

      "Andre Onana is yet to feature in the Premier League, but played in the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town on Thursday. Meanwhile, Altay Bayindir has started both matches but has yet to make the impact he would have hoped for.",
      "Lammens was absent from Antwerp's win over KV Mechelen last Sunday amid speculation about his future. Speaking to the media on Friday, Antwerp boss Stef Wils provided a transfer update on his goalkeeper.",
      "\"Senne is following an individual program, in consultation with all parties,\" he said. \"That’s a logical decision. Since this could be a major outgoing transfer, we want to minimise the risk of injuries.\"",
      "The 23-year-old is reportedly keen on a move to Old Trafford this summer, though Antwerp are said to have no preference and are willing to sell the goalkeeper to the highest bidder.",
      "Galatasaray have also expressed interest, with The Telegraph reporting that talks are underway with the Turkish club.",
      "Sources note that meetings have taken place in Monaco to explore a potential deal. With the Turkish transfer deadline on September 12, Galatasaray have a little extra time if needed.",
      "Currently, Lammens is not training and is set to miss Antwerp’s Belgian Pro League clash with Westerlo this evening.",

      "\"There is no agreement and we have withdrawn the transfer offer because Real Betis can't afford the transfer fee and the amounts that Manchester United must [instead] pay the player before the transfer,\" the statement read.",

      "Negotiations had been ongoing all summer whilst Antony was also linked to other clubs, however BBC Sport claim United had finally accepted an offer from Betis and a deal was on its way to completion.",
      "However, the Spaniards have pulled the plug in a major twist to the saga. They released a subsequent statement, saying: \"Betis has retired its offer. Betis cannot afford a transfer fee, nor the amounts the player is supposed to receive.\"",
      "Before this Antony was said to be close to flying out on Friday night to conclude a medical for the move. Now everything is on hold with little over two days to find a resolution.",
      "Some small reprieve for United is that whereas the window for Premier League clubs to complete signings is 7:00pm on Monday, September 1, La Liga sides have until 11:00pm.",

      "The Portuguese has won eight of his 34 domestic matches in charge of United but the team have had a winless start to the season and do not have a cup tie now until the FA Cup third round in January.",

      "\"Guys, to be really honest with you guys, every time that we have or have in the future one defeat like that, I'm going to be like that,\" Amorim said. \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.",

      "\"We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And then that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything. But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one.",

      "When asked if he still had that feeling now, Amorim replied: \"I felt that after the game (at Grimsby). I don't feel that now. So it's a little bit like that. I think that is the hardest part of the defeat. Sometimes it's not the result, it's the way we lost that game or draw that game. That is the thing that is hard to accept. Because we can do better.",

      "Amorim believes the midfielder still has to develop aspects of his game to regain his place in the starting XI. Mainoo sustained a muscular injury in February that effectively cost him his first-team role but he has started only 15 times under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo has played in midfield, as one of the two No.10s and even up front in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system but more experienced options and new signings now occupy those roles.",

      "Mainoo was one of a handful of United players regarded as untouchable last summer but his failure to agree a new contract has created uncertainty around his future.",
      "United negotiated a new deal with Mainoo in February 2023 when he was still only 17 and had played twice for the club. Mainoo has now appeared 73 times for United and Mainoo scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City before he started for England in the European Championship final later that year.",
      "The discrepancy in Mainoo's status and salary has led to an impasse in contract talks. Mainoo rejected United's opening offer at the start of the year and Amorim confirmed last week there was \"no news\" on the matter.",
      "United have been on the lookout for a new midfielder but parked plans to move for Carlos Baleba, with the Brighton enforcer valued at £100million.",

      "Nick Woltemade: From Bundesliga Bench to Tyneside Dreams (A Black-and-White Fantasy)\nI write to you today as a concerned football fan and part-time emotional support therapist for long-suffering Newcastle supporting friends regarding the growing whispers of Nick Woltemade being eyed as *the* solution to their striker shortage.",
      "Let’s be honest here. Nick Woltemade sounds less like a centre-forward and more like a password you’d get if you smashed your forehead against the keyboard while trying to log into Football Manager after three pints. Yes, he’s tall. Yes, he’s German. But we’ve all seen this movie before—and no, I’m not talking about the 2014 World Cup Final. I’m talking about **“The Obertan Illusion: Part Deux.”**",
      "This smells like what happened when Sir Alex Ferguson (usually a man of genius) decided that **Manucho**—a name that still haunts Old Trafford like a forgotten MySpace login—was going to be the next big thing. Tall? Check. Foreign? Check. Scored once in Angola? Triple check. Manucho had all the hype and none of the Premier League minutes. Sound familiar?",
      "Now, I’m not saying Woltemade will definitely follow in Manucho’s footsteps and disappear into a Bundesliga B team before we can finish pronouncing his name. But in the harsh light of Premier League reality, signing him to solve their goal-scoring crisis feels less like a bold footballing move and more like a deleted scene from 8½, where the director is spiralling into madness trying to find meaning in a striker with two career goals and the gait of a confused giraffe.",
      "Let me be clear: this isn’t anti-Woltemade propaganda. It’s just that Newcastle need a proven striker, not someone who sounds like he moonlights as a Berlin-based techno DJ on weekends.",
      "If the plan is to sign Nick Woltemade to “develop for the future,” then fine—but don’t pretend he’s the cavalry. That’d be like sending in a kazoo to back up the brass section. And let’s face it, if Nick really was the answer, we’d all be asking a much stranger question.",

This is the reason elite players ultimately don’t want to stay. They have elite mentality and they’re at a club which doesn’t. So they either become players who only care if it’s a big game or they move on.",

      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Losing late in the Carabao Cup certainly hasn’t helped.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Amorim could resign or be sacked but as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",

      "Amorim’s side have no win from their first three games of the season, with the penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby in the Carabao a stunning nadir for team and manager. The sight of him, 2-0 down to League Two opposition and fiddling about with magnets on his tactics board, already has a McClaren’s Umbrella feel to it.",

      "The former Borussia Dortmund boss was high in the reckoning for the Tottenham job, mostly we suspect because he is available. The same criteria could get him the nod here, and it’s fair to say that former Dortmund bosses have generally done okay in Our League.",
      "",
      "Has done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should, they definitely won’t.",
      "",
      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until next summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "",
      "Has extended his Germany contract until after Euro 2028, which would appear to rule him out, but the lure of the elite club game can be strong and Nagelsmann in the Premier League has long felt inevitable somewhere down the line.",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an “interesting” club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Backed in over recent days as talk continues to swirl around his Nottingham Forest future. He’s a fine manager, but we simply cannot see United going for this at all. Especially given how his previous attempt to manage a Big Six banter club turned out.",

      "Would ‘knows the club’ trump the fact that Carrick has not long been sacked by a Championship club? It didn’t work out brilliantly for Frank Lampard at Chelsea, but it remains a curiously beguiling CV booster even at the very heftiest of clubs.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",

      "The Saturday 3pm slot has been decimated and desecrated more than ever this Premier League season, but it refuses to go quietly.",
      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",
      "Andoni Iraola might just be a genius, while Ruben Amorim looks more lucky general after a late VAR intervention spared United more blushes after a truly mortifying week.",
      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "",
      "The signing of Nick Woltemade means Newcastle are very unlikely to bring in Strand Larsen, with Wolves always deeply reluctant to sanction any move. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira is not ruling out his departure, though, and Craig Hope reported on Friday that the striker isn’t playing against Everton this weekend, which certainly adds fuel to the fire, while not aligning with the club’s stance on his exit. Maybe they’re just waiting for the window to close and for this all to blow over after the player’s ‘polite’ request to be sold. But he’s just too similar to Woltemade and Yoane Wissa is a more realistic option.",

Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement.

The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend.",
      "Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

      "Aston Villa have ‘expressed an interest’ in completing a deal for West Ham star Lucas Paqueta and could hijack Manchester United in another pre-deadline transfer.",
      "The Villans have been quiet this summer after failing to qualify for the Champions League on the final day of last season has further limited an already small transfer budget as they struggle to star with the confines of PSR regulations.",
      "Only goalkeeper Marco Bizot and forward Evann Guessand have been signed this summer for little more than £30m, while 14 players have left either on loan or permanently.",
      "And Unai Emery confirmed in his press conference ahead of their clash with Crystal Palace on Sunday that he “needs two or three players more” before the window shuts on Monday.",
      "Emery said: “We are not expecting something special for the last three days around letting some players leave in the last two to three days.",
      "“We are expecting to add us some players, because we need to improve only for numbers in the squad with the players we will want for the season, and now we need two or three players more. This is the idea.”",
      "Villa are still in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over re-signing Marco Asensio, who impressed for them on loan in the second half of last season.",
      "MORE ASTON VILLA COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 West Ham above Man City and Chelsea in five-year Premier League net spend table!\n👉 Aston Villa can awake from their transfer slumber to block Alexander Isak to Liverpool\n👉 Liverpool plot £210m double deal after Newcastle confirm Isak boost and ‘direct contact’ from RB Leipzig",
      "Personal terms aren’t thought to be an issue but the two clubs are struggling to agree a fee for the Spain international.",
      "And that’s pushed Villa to consider a move for Paqueta, who scored a stunning goal in the 5-1 defeat to Chelsea last weekend and has started all three of the Hammers’ first three fixtures of the season after the FA announced in July that a regulatory commission had found the most serious charges of spot fixing against the Brazil international “to be not proven”.",
      "He was heavily linked with a move to Manchester City in the summer of 2023 before that allegations came to light and The Athletic now claim Villa have ‘expressed an interest’ in landing him before the deadline, with Emery and Villa’s recruitment Staff ‘big admirers’ of the 28-year-old.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Arranging a financial package, however, is very tough to do, with Villa working to comply with UEFA restrictions and the likely fee West Ham will demand is prohibitive.’",
      "And The Telegraph’s Mike McGrath claims Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens – who’s thought to be on the verge of a move to Manchester United – has also ’emerged as an option for Aston Villa’.",
      "McGrath adds that Galatasaray are also in the running for the 23-year-old, with ‘nothing decided yet’ on his landing spot this summer.",
      "Premier League side Tottenham have made yet another offer to sign Nico Paz from Italian outfit Como this summer, according to reports.",
      "Premier League title hopefuls Arsenal are ready to make an opening offer for Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",
      "Manchester City are back in the hunt for West Ham United playmaker Lucas Paqueta, who is available for £30million, according to reports.",
      "While found innocent of the most serious offences, Paqueta faces punishment after failing to comply with the FA’s investigation",
      "According to reports, West Ham United star Lucas Paqueta will avoid a lifetime ban as he is ‘set to be cleared of spot-fixing charges’."

      "Plenty of you believe Ruben Amorim should either resign or be sacked, with three replacements touted in the Mailbox, but he’s also not the problem in the minds of many, and as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s also a bit of Newcastle anger at Liverpool and some Champions League frustration, but this is indeed another Amorim, Manchester United edition.",
      "Send your thoughts on the Old Trafford mess or anything else to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "There’s something fundamentally wrong about the United spirit. It’s bigger than squad revamp, or structural development. It’s the psyche.\nIn the Fergie era, playing against a team with John O’Shea and Fredrico Macheda, you still held your breath, knowing that United were capable of springing up surprises.",
      "Since Fergie’s departure, there’s a kind of trepidation coaches face with managing the team. Every coach since then, has tried to pick out scapegoats responsible for dampening the team spirit and there’s been much talk on players who are hungry enough to win for the team. In spite of it, the sloppiness lingers. The team spirit remains lackadaisical. Players do the bare minimum with the only consistent player across several seasons being Fernades.",
      "The reason I adore Mourinho’s time with United is based on the simple fact he worked the boys to a Europa trophy. You could see the way some of the players limped towards their medals. He pushed them hard. It reminded of what it meant to play for Ferguson. You either worked your butt off or moved. Other coaches treat them as snowflakes.",
      "Amorim’s recent interview has shown he is not fit for the job. His morale is low. His drive, beaten up. He has not shown any sense of urgency by tweaking his formation. He is like the proverbial mad man doing the same thing over and again while expecting the same results.",
      "This is business, not a charity organization. If he can’t inspire this team, after ostracizing other players in his revamp, he should resign.\nVictor, Nigeria. Glory Glory Man Utd.",
      "",
      "What (the f..k) is wrong with MUFC? Your inbox is overflowing with vitriol, hand wringing and hundreds of different interpretations but I have YET to see one viable solution. We’ve changed owners, infrastructure, coaches, players, playing style and goodness knows what else yet nothing seems to have worked.",
      "Maybe, as someone (somewhat harshly) said, we’ve just reverted back to the mean, i.e. pre Fergie days, the days of Duxbury and Blackmore, or the 70’s team that got relegated, before we developed (or more accurately, marketed!) this rubbish about DNA. The media follows and scrutinizes every nuance (“his facial expressions look like he’s given up”) and former players constantly pound on about how things used to be. They remind me of the MAGA folk with their constant mantra of “Make United Great Again”. Let’s me honest, during the Fergie years, we were blessed, spoilt and damn lucky. A whole bunch of things came together at the same time. The stars were aligned. But WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT TO EVER BE THAT GOOD AGAIN. And this is the simple fact that everyone seems to be ignoring.",
      "The current owners suck every penny possible from the club while the players drive up in luxury cars.  I’m sure it’s a toxic place to work at the moment. We’ve had countless managers in the last few years. Does anyone seriously think a new manager is the solution? And as Amorin said, you can’t change all 22 players. “Open Heart Surgery”? This patient has flat lined.",
      "The only solution, as far as I can see, is to stick with Amorin and go down. This will shed the prima donnas and allow us to re-build with young, hungry youth who still think it is a privilege to play for the shirt (which ironically is what Amorin did at Sporting). Last season we were (un)lucky not to go down and just a few months later, Gary Neville thinks we will make the Top Four! Maybe a season or two out of the spotlight is about the only thing that hasn’t been tried. Then we will really see who wants to play for MUFC making JUST 50k a week!\nAdidasmufc (If it forced the Glazers to sell, it might even be worth it)",
      "",
      "So the Man Utd manager merry go round looks like it’s cranking up again right on time. I’d expect the players to come out and give another terrible performance against Burnley just to twist the knife and ensure there is no option but to sack Amorim. 2-0 or 3-1 to Burney I would guess with a goalkeeper howler the icing on the cake – probably an Olympico.",
      "Whether you want him to stay longer or not, like him or not, it is pretty ridiculous to blame the manager. Yet another high profile manager who has failed.",
      "So it must be the players then? According to Transfermkt we have the 5th most expensive squad in the league. And we were 5th last year too yet finished 15th. So it surely cannot be the quality of the players.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the players attitude is terrible and has been for a long time regardless of who is in charge. They do manage to pick themselves up for the big games and occasionally get a commendable draw to fool us into thinking there’s some hope. Attitude is not the players fault. Your attitude is driven by your compensation and working conditions. Clearly Utd players are extremely well compensated so even clearer is that their working conditions must be absolutely atrocious. Yes, it must be terrible to pick up 200 k per week to kick a ball about I hear you say. Grimsby players are happily kicking a ball about with smiles on their faces for significantly less money. So are most of the other teams in the premier league.",
      "So yeah, let’s just get a shiny new manager again, spend a few hundred million on his type of players and listen to the club bulshit us that they have a long term plan and that it will take a few transfer windows to fix. Don’t worry, we’ll win the league in three years time lads, we have a plan… does the 3 years start again with the new manager? Asking for a friend…",
      "The way the club is run, we deserve to be relegated but that still wouldn’t make those in charge stop and think that maybe it’s never been the pl;ayers or the manager, they’re just the easy targets of a club where so many senior club positions have seen well renowned people come and go with such regularity that clearly there is political fuck-tard-ery hapenning that is ruining the club from the inside. We have no right to think we should be title contenders every year but the amount of money the club has compared to the rest does mean that the current state of the club can only be caused by severe incompetenece at board level.\nJon, Cape Town (Get relegated, Glazers out, maybe we might win a few games in the Championship, especially if all our current players defect and we have to bring through our youth.

      "When Rúben Amorim walked into Manchester United, I’ll admit it: I let optimism in through the front door. Not blind optimism, not naïve giddiness, but a conscious decision on how to live life and how to relate to football. Supporting United, after all, isn’t just about results. It’s about how you choose to hold yourself through the cycles of joy and pain.",

      "Arsenal: Pleasure in the Pain",
      "A loss is a loss, and a title race probably died before it was ever born – but the performance brought more pleasure than pain. United played well. Fine margins swung the contest: VAR blessing Arsenal with a questionable goal, a penalty shout ignored, Dorgu’s shot pinging off the post, Raya standing tall in goal. There was enough there to feel alive again, to sense possibility.",
      "Fulham: A Half to Remember Against Fulham,",
      "Disappointment on paper but a bright first half. Cunha already looks like he could be sensational. Amorim nailed it in his analysis: United became too focused on holding onto the result rather than playing. That’s coaching clarity – an honesty I value more than lip service.",
      "Grimsby: oh God Grimsby! Goalkeepers and Perspective",
      "Then came Grimsby. What do you even say? The truth is simple: United need a goalkeeper. Hard to find, harder to bed in, but the difference it makes is night and day.And yet as bad as it was and jeez loueeeze Onana why! — United clawed back to 2-2, showed fight, and were a penalty away from advancing. Embarrassing? Of course. Defining? Not really. Ole reached semis and finals without winning them. Ten Hag delivered two trophies, but that wasn’t enough to make me shed a tear when he left. In fact i cheered. He was an odd man!  Football moves on.",
      "On Amorim",
      "Here’s the crux: I love Amorim. It could be another false dawn. He could be sacked tomorrow if results don’t turn. His post-Grimsby interview carried a chill that United fans know too well. But that doesn’t shake me.  Because how you support your club is personal. For me, it’s not about playing small or coy. I grew up in the glory days. I will die on the hill that football is cyclical, and United will be back. Juventus were relegated, came back, and won multiple titles. Why should Manchester United be any different?So yes, results are awful. Amorim’s future is uncertain. But Manchester United aren’t a pity project. We’re a behemoth, and behemoths rise. Sunnier days will come.",

Once he’s finally jettisoned from the Ibrox hot seat he’ll hopefully never darken the door of a dugout ever again.",
      "Without going into detail about our inevitably pathetic start to this season under Martin (because I know that know one is bothered about Scottish football other than Johnny Nic), I wanted to touch on the strangely similar fates of Rangers and Man Utd, two former perennial league challengers who suffered equally if slightly different humiliations on Wednesday night.",
      "Both clubs emerged as the dominant force in their countries in the 90s, both big spenders who could pick and choose who they wanted and hoovered up trophy after trophy, becoming the panto villains of their leagues. Then in the 2000s, both were suddenly pegged back by domestic challenges – in Scotland from a Larsson-inspired O’Neill side and from Wenger/Mourinho respectively in England. The trophies weren’t as easy to come by in this decade though both clubs did manage 3 titles in a row amongst some other great moments.",
      "Then the wheels come off. For Rangers this is 2012, admin, relegation to the Scottish third division and a painful and mind-numbing climb back up to the top flight. For United, 2013 and the retirement of Fergie. Obviously their 2010s weren’t as totally abject but it’s clearly when the rot set in.",
      "Since then both clubs have had little glimmers of hope – the odd trophy, a league title for Rangers, both have reached EL finals – but currently both find themselves with unwanted and disliked ‘system’ managers with neither the players to play these systems, nor the ability to coach them.",
      "Maybe they’re still the clubs which best represent the UK in 2025. Both fallen giants, one with a huge global reach but with supporters who must be wondering why they should still bother to respect their adopted club, the other undone by financial mismanagement and dodgy tax practices. Both currently owned by Americans.",
      "So what lies in store for these two 90s giants? Do we sit tight and await the arrival of some sort of new generational manager to rescue us? Hope that our rivals fail so badly as to allow us to catch up? What does it mean when the classic glory-hunter clubs stop achieving glory?",

      "As my mail a week back, when United were still riding the high of the Arsenal draw, already said: Amorim is a goner.",
      "1. Tactical inflexibility. His formation doesn’t suit the squad and actually makes good players worse by forcing them into bad roles. He insists on two in midfield — but in the Premier League, you need two cyborgs to cover that ground. Cyborgs don’t exist yet.",
      "2. The Bruno dilemma. Amorim didn’t have the guts to move on from Bruno at the pivotal moment when the money could have been reinvested. Instead, the team remains unbalanced around him.",
      "3. Favoritism over competition. He preaches competition but picks his favourites regardless of form. That’s how you lose the dressing room — just ask Ten Hag or Solskjaer.",
      "4. The “donut guy” effect. Amorim is the classic office donut guy: bad at his job but really nice, so people look the other way. He gives media and YouTubers open access, which shields him from proper criticism.",
      "All in all, he’s finished. The real worry is what comes next. The United hierarchy will panic and swing back towards a “local” man-manager type — Gareth Southgate territory — and we’ll end up with another Maguire contract to show for it.",
      "Mark my words.",
      "Kind regards,\nMike",
      "",
      "For such a big fellow, Andre Onana sure has weak hands, and everybody knows it now. Will he leave at a deep discount after a loan ot three, or grimly run his contract down? And is Amorim as done as he looks, or is ownership paralyzed by the investments they’ve made in him — i.e., the good players he’s discarded and/or demoralized, some of whom have already been sold at significant losses, and the dubious players he’s brought in for his 343 master plan that’s, honestly, *this close to clicking. I’m rather hoping it’s the latter, because I’d be quite keen to see Kobbie Mainoo in black and white. I do think that Manchester United supporters should keep faith in Mbeumo and Sesko, though. Sesko got into the right spots far better than Hojlund ever did.",
      "And speaking of poor form: to whomever it was that accused NUFC of dirty play against Liverpool earlier this week, your post nearly made me write furious things. But I let it rest for a while and can now simply suggest you rewatch that match whilst sober, then consider the injury list it left. Ekitike yanked Tonali’s arm out of its socket, for goodness’ sake. While I watched, I was almost always angry at what your lot got away with; I’ll spare you the list, of which I hope you have been made aware by now. That said, it wasn’t all one-way. We got away with a few bad fouls, too, and nobody is complaining about Gordon’s red card (except at Gordon himself). We can all do with being less one-eyed. And at least we agree that the match was poorly refereed by Simon Hooper and (especially, for me at least) John Brooks.",

      "And irritatingly, we had that same kind of state when we appointed Ole to replace the toxicity of Jose. Straightforward talk, good mood, players responded and we came close to success. Yes, both managers lack tactical knowledge but we can see what supposed tactical experts deliver.",
      "That said, sometimes sacking the manager is still the right thing. Moyes was out of his depth, had entirely the wrong attitude. And while his backing such as it was made headlines for all the wrong reasons, he also could fall back on a squad that had just won the league. Aging, sure, but obviously capable. We can definitely agree that it set the tone for the utter dismantling of everything that had been built.",
      "Ole was also shafted by the board deciding unilaterally to sign Ronaldo even though he wasn’t needed or wanted by the manager. He completely destabilised the team that was seeming to be coming together. He might have even got something out of Sancho, because there’s a lad that needs an arm round the shoulder not being shouted at. He did choose to sign Maguire though, so he’ll always have that mark against him. But sacking Ole was wrong, for me. The facts of his tenure prove it.",
      "We weren’t wrong to sack Jose, who had made the club a very unpleasant place. I think we were wrong to sack Van Gaal. Yes, the football made your eyes bleed but he was in the middle of changing the team, and had form for delivering good football. He still brought success.",
      "Similarly, we were wrong to sack Ten Hag, who was also in the middle of the rebuild, and delivered success on the pitch. We replaced “he has no style” with *this*, after all, and mostly because he never got the media onside. But we should have also listen to Rangnick (also more points per game than Amorim).",
      "It is clear to anyone with eyes that Amorim is not providing any answers and is making more problems than solutions. He needs to go. Whoever comes next needs to be someone who picks the team up again. We aren’t in a position of expecting success – although inevitably there are many “fans” who think otherwise – but we absolutely have a squad that should be at the upper end of the league. That’s not entitlement, that’s just plain obvious. We were, after all, 4 points from 3rd and FA Cup holders when this maniac was appointed against the judgement of Dan Ashworth. The arrogance and ignorance of billionaires in full effect.",
      "The answer is someone stable, who brings some happiness back to the squad. I don’t want it to be Southgate – he was a little weasel of a player – but managers like him are two a penny. And maybe someone like Ruud or Carrick would have a higher ceiling? Give them until the end of the season and then extend for another year, year on year.",

A world class manager at their peak needs to be appointed (you’ve not appointed one at their peak in the last 12 years apart from perhaps mourinho on the top of the downslope and he got you second with a bunch of players with terrible attitudes as he stated at the time). And you need to let that manager buy the players they believe are good enough and bring youth through.

I’m not going to be like that. I am going to be who I am. At that moment I was very disappointed. We had a good pre-season. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And a bad game against Grimsby. Now it is a new game and I am focused on that.”",

      "Enzo Maresca has confirmed Chelsea will be without Cole Palmer for Saturday’s west London derby against Fulham, while also acknowledging the imminent arrival of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Palmer was named in the starting XI for last week’s emphatic 5-1 win at West Ham but pulled out during the warm-up and watched from the sidelines.",
      "He was not included in the England squad named by Thomas Tuchel on Friday, and Maresca explained why he will not be available at Stamford Bridge.",
      "“Cole is out,” the Chelsea boss said. “Also, Benoit is out, and Romeo is out. The rest are all okay. Cole we need to see day by day, and the other two I don’t think are going to be back after the international break. But they are going to be closer.”",
      "Asked about Palmer being omitted by England, Maresca added: “I spoke with Thomas a few times, but in the end it’s Thomas’ decision and he decided that. He is not available tomorrow, so it shows that he has a problem.”",
      "Maresca admitted his side is weaker without Palmer but stressed the need to adapt, as they did against West Ham.",
      "“For sure, 100 per cent, we are a much better team with Cole, no doubt,” he said. “But when Cole is not in the game, we need to find different solutions. Last week we found different solutions, and hopefully tomorrow we can again find different solutions.”",

      "Estevao Willian started in Palmer’s place at the London Stadium, joining an attack that also featured Joao Pedro and Liam Delap for the first time. Maresca suggested similar changes will be required against Fulham as he manages a growing injury list.",
      "Romeo Lavia and Benoit Badiashile will also remain sidelined. “With Romeo and Benoit, it’s normal after a long time out that they will need time and sessions,” Maresca explained.",
      "“It’s the same with what we are doing with Wes [Fofana]. Wes is back and the other day he played some minutes. Hopefully, we can have more minutes and get him to the right condition.”",
      "On Lavia’s progress, he continued: “Two years ago he didn’t play any games. Last year he played some games, this season the target is to give him more games.",
      "“Hopefully, the moment he is back, he can be fit for a long time and play more minutes and games, because he is a player we really trust.”",
      "There was also a word on Chelsea’s incoming business, with Alejandro Garnacho now close to signing from Manchester United.",
      "“I know Garnacho is around here,” Maresca said. “It’s quite clear his position is a winger, and I see him as a winger.”",
      "Maresca left the door open to further changes before the window closes. “You can expect anything with the transfer window open – anything can happen in and out,” he said.",

      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Barrott was then told to review the decision by VAR Stuart Atwell. After a three-minute review, Barrott awarded a penalty for a \"sustained pulling action\" from Anthony on Amad. The shirt pull started outside the penalty area.",

      "Similar to the later penalty that was awarded, the contact began outside of the area before the pair ended up on the floor in the area.",
      "In this case, Barrott awarded the penalty; however, following a five-minute review and being advised to check the screen, the on-field decision was overturned with a drop-ball awarded to the Clarets.",
      "\"When Kyle Walker makes initial contact, he's about a foot outside of the area, so I think it might be overturned and given a free-kick outside [the penalty area]. The actual contact is on the back of his calf and it's outside the area.",
      "\"If it's outside, it's factual [so it should be overturned]. It's in or out. So for me it's a free-kick for United from outside the area, in my opinion.\n\"The initial contact was outside and then he's fallen inside.

      "At 2-1 down, Burnley thought they were level as Foster capped a fine move only for his effort to be ruled out for offside.",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",

      "Image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo celebrating in February 2024 went viral but 16 months on all three could be heading for the Manchester United exit door; what went wrong for promising young trio and who is to blame for their failure to fire for Ruben Amorim?",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:32, UK",
      "Instantly iconic. But now, for the wrong reasons.",
      "The image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration in February 2024, appeared to showcase Man Utd's bright future.",
      "A year-and-a-half on, Hojlund and Garnacho look set to leave before the end of this transfer window, Mainoo is out of the first-team frame in the Premier League, while the club lurches into another crisis.",
      "How did it come to this? And who is to blame?",
      "Hojlund, then aged 21, had opened the scoring against West Ham. Alejandro Garnacho, just 19, struck two more. Kobbie Mainoo, the 18-year-old academy starlet, would go on to start a Euros final for England a few months later.",
      "Their combined celebration for Garnacho's first goal was a cheeky dig back at West Ham's Mohammed Kudus, who had marked his goal in the reverse fixture a couple of months earlier in similar fashion.",
      "But it came to stand for more than that. This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.",
      "Hojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.",
      "Garnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Mainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.",
      "Sitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.",
      "But unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.",
      "He could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.",
      "After all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.",
      "Yet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.",
      "The Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.",
      "He got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.",
      "A short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.",
      "There have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.",
      "For Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.",
      "And there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.",
      "Interestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.",
      "It is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.",
      "They are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.",
      "Where, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?",
      "Would Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?",
      "The pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.",
      "It has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.",
      "Hojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was one of five Manchester United players to be left out of first-team action during pre-season; Chelsea have already spent over £250m this summer, with fellow attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens joining Enzo Maresca's squad",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 11:57, UK",
      "Chelsea have agreed a £40m fee with Manchester United to sign Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The forward was undergoing a medical on Friday.",
      "The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest ever sale of an academy graduate.",
      "A compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m - which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.",
      "United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.",
      "It is understood he leaves with United's best wishes.",
      "Garnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and he is not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad.",
      "\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m.",
      "\"I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.",
      "\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.",
      "\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players.",
      "\"This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.",
      "\"From United's perspective, they are very, very happy because a £40m fixed fee is a very good deal for them, for a player who didn't really have a future at the club.\"",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, United boss Amorim said: \"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
