      "Alan Shearer has cast serious doubt on Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United, suggesting a defeat to Sunderland could lead to his dismissal, with Zinedine Zidane reportedly lying in wait for a significant managerial role. The Red Devils head coach is feeling the heat following a 3-1 loss to Brentford last weekend.",
      "Despite assurances from United's hierarchy that Amorim retains the backing of the board, speculation about his job security is intensifying. Amorim's record in the Premier League has been underwhelming, amassing just 34 points from a possible 99 since taking charge.",
      "The recent Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town prompted United's hierarchy to publicly support him. Newcastle United icon Shearer hasn't minced words regarding Amorim's stint at United, with the team languishing in 14th place in the league.",
      "\"I think if Man United lose to Sunderland he could possibly be sacked,\" Shearer said to Betfair. \"I hate talking about managers and the potential of losing jobs, but Ruben Amorim isn't helping himself, is he?\"",
      "He added: \"Things are getting worse under Amorim, which is remarkable. They certainly haven't improved, that's for sure. They're 14th in the Premier League and that was unacceptable last season.",
      "\"There were excuses for last season which maybe you could put up, but this season there's no excuse for what they've spent. I do find it remarkable that they're getting worse and nothing's changing.",
      "\"Amorim is refusing to budge from his system which, clearly, his players aren't comfortable playing. He doesn't help himself sometimes. We did a graphic on Match of the Day last weekend where he was constantly changing the back five, put Mason Mount on as a no.10 and then four minutes later changed him to a left wing-back. It looks very confusing sometimes, it really does.",
      "\"It is what it is. I don't suspect you'll get many tears from other fans. They're probably enjoying it. Amorim is under a lot of pressure, and the noise will get a lot louder if they don't beat Sunderland this weekend.\"",
      "Shearer also speculated on Zidane's next move amid reports linking the Real Madrid legend with the Old Trafford hotseat: \"I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but I guess Zidane is sitting, waiting for a huge job where he's got the potential to go and win things.",
      "\"I don't think that potential is at Man United for a few years yet, so I'd be really surprised if Zidane was to go to Man United.\"",
      "He added: \"At the end of the day, they're Man United. One of the biggest clubs in the world and you'll always get someone who thinks they can come in and turn things around.",
      "\"But it's just been mistake after mistake after mistake and there's a part of me that believes Amorim is still in the job because of the errors that have been made by people who've come in above him. Every single corner, they've made a mistake.",
      "\"Whether it was bringing Dan Ashworth in, sacking him and putting him on gardening leave, putting ticket prices up, getting rid of staff, players they've signed. Everything seems to have been the wrong decision so I do believe the results have been nowhere near good enough and they can't wait much longer to turn them around.\"",

      "Antony has hit out at the treatment he received after being frozen out by Manchester United, accusing the club of showing a \"lack of respect\" and \"rudeness\" in his final days at Old Trafford.",
      "The Brazil winger spent the second half of last season on loan at Real Betis and made no secret of his desire to make a permanent return to the La Liga outfit during the summer. But he had to wait until the final days of the transfer window to get his wish and was effectively exiled by Ruben Amorim in the meantime, being forced to train away from the first-team squad as well as being excluded from the club's pre-season friendlies.",
      "And Antony believes that the club's approach to him and other the players in the United 'bomb squad' who were deemed surplus to requirements, such as Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, left a lot to be desired.",
      "\"Look, I'm not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people, in fact, I won't mention anyone's name here,\" Antony told ESPN Brasil when he was asked to reflect on his his final weeks as a Manchester United player. \"But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a good morning, a good afternoon.",
      "\"Not even that. But, anyway, that's in the past, I won't give much importance to these things. Now I'm here, at Betis, I'm living here, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Antony followed Erik ten Hag to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 for a transfer fee that would have surpassed £86million if all the add-ons and bonuses were met. But he failed to replicate the dazzling form he showed in the Eredivisie with Ajax and was sold for a huge loss by United to Betis after weeks of negotiations, eventually moving for just £21.65m.",
      "But while Antony believes there were mitigating factors behind his failure to make it in the Premier League, he takes responsibility for things not working out.",
      "Asked why he believed things did not go well at United, Antony replied: \"I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance. I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing.",
      "\"I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things, going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",

      "Former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson has placed the blame squarely on the Manchester United players rather than Ruben Amorim ahead of Saturday's crucial Premier League encounter with Sunderland. United have managed just two victories this entire campaign and find themselves languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League standings.",
      "Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether this position would shift should they suffer defeat against Sunderland this weekend. When questioned about the turmoil at Old Trafford, Johnson maintained that the problems stem from elsewhere rather than the head coach and suggested he could envisage Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos maintaining their support for the Portuguese manager.",
      "\"I can see Amorim sticking it out at United purely because the club might think they have to stand by a manager at some point,\" he told 10bet. \"They've been through so many different names already, maybe they will decide that always chopping and changing isn't the answer.",
      "\"With the squad they've got, the players just aren't good enough to be challenging the top sides. That's why Manchester United are where they are, not because of the manager.",
      "\"They're getting beaten because the squad isn't good enough. The United of old is long gone.",
      "\"Everyone's expecting them to fight back into the top four, and they're just nowhere near that anymore. They've shown for years now that they aren't good enough, so I don't think you can just pin it on the manager.",
      "\"There's a lot that needs fixing. If they sack Amorim, they have a new manager who inherits the same squad. Then what?\"",
      "When pressed on who he could see taking over from Amorim should he depart, Johnson declined to suggest a replacement. Instead, he maintained that any incoming boss would face an uphill battle at United in their current state.",
      "\"You can't build consistency if you have no foundation,\" he explained. \"It's a top club, they're a huge name.",
      "\"For years they were the best, and now they can't defend a straight, 50-yard pass. It's crazy to see. They need to get back to the basics. Not of the Premier League, but of schoolboy football.",
      "\"I don't think I could recommend any manager who would be the right one to fix this, because it's the same for years with these players. The same mistakes.",
      "\"I feel sorry for this manager and I'd feel sorry for the next one, because they will always be the ones getting the blame and getting sacked. In this state, there's no manager who could get them back to the top any time soon.\"",

      "Manchester United and Sunderland look set to be missing six key players between them when they lock horns at Old Trafford. Beleaguered United manager Ruben Amorim is in desperate need for a victory against the newly promoted Black Cats.",
      "Meanwhile, Regis Le Bris' side are enjoying an impressive return to the Premier League. Many tipped them for relegation, but they are currently in a battle for Champions League football, albeit it's still early days.",
      "United suffered a crushing 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium last weekend, whilst Sunderland secured a vital 1-0 triumph over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Currently, United sit just three points above the drop zone, despite spending more than £200million on players in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sunderland may sense an opportunity, though they haven't triumphed at Old Trafford since May 2014, when Sebastian Larsson netted the decisive strike in a 1-0 victory on the season's penultimate day. However, Sunderland have received encouraging news ahead of the fixture.",
      "Addressing the media on Thursday, Le Bris revealed Nordi Mukiele is fully fit and ready to feature against United. The French boss said: \"Nordi is fine, he's OK. We have no new injuries.\"",
      "Le Bris added: \"With Romaine [Mundle] and Dennis [Cirkin], there is no definite date for their return to play. We think it will probably be a month, maybe a month and a half.",
      "\"With Leo [Hjelde] and Aji [Alese] it is similar. Leo is back running, with Aji there was a very small injury so he took a little step back. Probably one month for each.\"",
      "Looking ahead to stepping out at Old Trafford, Le Bris added: \"Being at Old Trafford demands strong personality and strong character. I still believe that we'll need to upgrade our performance to be competitive in Manchester.",
      "\"They are strong, create many chances from everywhere, direct play in behind, set pieces, with talented players. Now it's just a question of click, confidence, circumstances, scenario.",
      "\"So for us the only thing we can control is our way of playing, the way we want to play this game, to face this challenge, being aware that it will be tough.\"",

      "The latter continues to recover from an anterior cruciate ligament problem he picked up back in February. Martinez has recently begun partial training sessions at Carrington as he works towards his comeback at the end of the year.",
      "Amorim will, though, have Casemiro available again after the midfielder sat out the west London reverse last week through suspension, plus Amad, who was granted compassionate leave following a family bereavement. Daniel Armer might also earn a squad place, having joined first-team training on Wednesday.",

The Red Devils spent big during the summer transfer window to strengthen their attack after managing a measly 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "United snapped up forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo before landing striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. However, their summer spending spree has seen Fernandes pushed into a deeper role on the field this campaign.",
      "The Portuguese star is widely considered United's finest acquisition during a barren spell since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. Yet he has struggled to make his mark in 2024/25 whilst operating in a more withdrawn midfield role under Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have experimented with various combinations of Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo alongside Fernandes, but the setup hasn't clicked. Hargreaves has voiced worries about how United's captain is being utilised during what has been a testing season at Old Trafford, with the club languishing in 14th place in the Premier League standings.",
      "\"But now Bruno has to play deeper to get on the ball and create. He's not playing his natural position, he's playing deeper.",
      "\"He's playing as a box-to-box midfielder. Bruno's one of the best creators in the division. So you've got to play him in his natural position.",
      "\"But because they play two 10s, you could argue Man Utd's two best players last season were Amad and Bruno. They were the two 10s, and then they went and signed two more 10s in Cunha and Mbeumo when you didn't have a keeper or a striker.\"",
      "Hargreaves has also called on Amorim to think about dropping Sesko and making a minor adjustment to get Fernandes into more attacking positions.",
      "\"I'd love to see Bruno play as a 10, maybe with Mbeumo as a No. 9,\" he continued. 'If you have Cunha and Bruno playing as two 10s plus Mbeumo, that's good.",
      "\"Maybe play Amad as a wing-back on the left if you want to stay with the formation. I just think it's harsh on Bruno, him being criticised. I can't imagine where they'd be without him. I said that to him last year, towards the end of the season before the Europa League final.",

      "Gareth Southgate would demand time and patience from Manchester United if he was to succeed Ruben Amorim. The former England manager is reportedly debating whether to throw his hat in the ring for the managerial position with the Red Devils should Amorim be sacked.",
      "However, it is suggested that Southgate would hold reservations about taking up tenure with the club and would demand four years to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which the board may not be willing to give him. As per the Sun, sources suggest that the boyhood United fan would need assurance that the top brass would stick to any long-term goals planned.",
      "The publication also claims that Southgate harbours concerns that the board would demand instant success from him, while he takes an approach centred around gradual success over a prolonged period. The 55-year-old has been out of work since stepping down as England manager last summer, after guiding the Three Lions to a runners-up place at Euro 2024 - losing 2-1 to Spain in the final.",
      "Southgate isn't the only manager who has been linked with succeeding Amorim. Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler have been rumoured as favourites to make the move to Old Trafford in the event of Amorim's departure, while the Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane and Barcelona icon Xavi Hernandez have also seen their names tossed into the mix.",
      "That's despite United ultimately showing no signs of parting ways with Amorim just yet, as he approaches his first full year at the helm. The Portuguese tactician took over the club after the sacking of Erik ten Hag last October, but could only manage a lacklustre 15th-place finish in the Premier League for the season.",
      "While Amorim was ultimately forgiven for a dismal showing, given he worked largely with the squad he inherited from the Dutchman, the 40-year-old will not be afforded the same excuses this time out. That's because the Red Devils board provided him with substantial backing this summer to make improvements to suit his patented 3-5-3 style of play, as well as a full pre-season tour to fine-tune his squad.",

      "It appears as though nothing has worked yet thus far, however, with United currently languishing at 14th in the Premier League standings after six matches, with just two wins and one draw to show for their efforts. And with an in-form Sunderland to play on Saturday, October 4, as well as games with the likes of Liverpool, Brighton and Tottenham on the horizon, the outlook could be far worse for the head coach in the coming weeks.",
      "Southgate hasn't managed in the Premier League since Middlesbrough were relegated from the English top flight in 2009. Instead, he turned his attention to international management with England in 2013, first taking the reins of the U21 side before promotion to the first-team three years later.",
      "While he failed to win a major trophy with the Three Lions, he successfully guided them to runner-up places at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, as well as a third-place finish in the UEFA Nations League in 2018/19.",

      "Manchester United have endured a difficult start to the season. The club’s 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend was the latest sign that the Red Devils are yet to click under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The team’s loss to Brentford was a stinging result ahead of another crucial test against Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend. Without European football to contend with, Amorim’s side have plenty of time to rest up, but watching the action from afar only serves as another reminder of the club’s failures.",
      "United’s consistently faltering league form, combined with their shock cup exit to Grimsby, has piled pressure on Amorim. The former Sporting Lisbon manager has been at Old Trafford for less than a year, but United are being linked with possible replacements.",
      "Meanwhile, the Champions League provided United with a fresh regret, as Rasmus Hojlund starred for Napoli. The United loanee had a tough couple of seasons at Old Trafford but has been likened to one of the Premier League ’s best strikers, just months after leaving the club.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has been linked with replacing Amorim at Old Trafford and the Red Devils could benefit from the Austrian coach’s contract situation. Glasner led Palace to FA Cup glory, the club’s first-ever major trophy, and his side are currently third in the table, but his contract is due to expire at the end of the season.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Glasner was offered an extension in the summer but preferred to see how the transfer window unfolded before putting pen to paper. Palace endured a frustrating summer, selling Eberechi Eze and almost losing Marc Guehi.",
      "The chances of Glasner staying with Palace beyond this season are described as “remote”. This could open the door for United to eventually make a move, given that he also favours a similar formation to Amorim.",
      "Players thriving once they leave United has become an ongoing theme, but few people would have predicted that Hojlund would earn comparisons to Manchester City ’s Erling Haaland. The 22-year-old United loanee scored twice in Napoli’s 2-1 win over Sporting on Wednesday, with both goals being assisted by Kevin De Bruyne, who compared the Dane to his former teammate.",
      "\"I think Rasmus has a lot of quality, I think he's quite similar to Haaland in terms of player type, both are left-footed and like to attack space,” De Bruyne said in a post-match interview. “It was a great night for him and I think he'll help us score a lot of goals from now on.”",
      "Hojlund’s calm finish for his first goal and winning header was a stark contrast to his performances for United and served as a reality check that players are struggling to fulfil their potential at the club. It is telling that Hojlund is thriving in the same team as last season’s Serie A MVP and former United midfielder Scott McTominay.",
      "Before completing his loan move to Napoli, Hojlund wanted to fight for his place at United this season. However, the arrival of Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford subsequently led Hojlund to join Antonio Conte ’s side.",
      "While it may have been unexpected, the move has already proven to be the right decision for Hojlund. He has three goals in seven games and looks set to easily eclipse the 10 he scored in 52 appearances for United last season.",
      "Given his initial determination to stick with United, Hojlund did not expect to score a Champions League brace this season, highlighting his twist of fate in a social media post. “‘Højlund scores twice in the Champions League after two assists from Kevin de Bruyne’ was not on my 2025 bingo card,” he wrote on Instagram.",

      "Manchester United icon Michael Carrick has secured an unexpected new position with UEFA, whilst speculation continues to swirl around Ruben Amorim's future at Old Trafford. The 44-year-old former Middlesbrough chief has been touted for a shock comeback to the Theatre of Dreams as caretaker boss, should United's top brass decide to axe the Portuguese tactician.",
      "It's a position he's familiar with, having previously stepped up as interim manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's exit from the club. Carrick's debut match in the hot seat was a triumph against Villarreal in the Champions League, and he also secured a thrilling 3-2 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "He resigned from his role as first-team coach when Ralf Rangnick arrived at Old Trafford, having chalked up two victories and one stalemate during his temporary stint at the helm.",
      "Carrick took charge at Boro in October 2022 and steered them to the Championship play-off semi-final at the conclusion of that campaign, where they fell to Coventry City.",
      "Despite that outstanding inaugural season, the United hero couldn't replicate the success and departed the Riverside in June this year following a 10th-place finish.",
      "Now, a few short months later, Carrick has been named as a UEFA Technical Observer and recently offered his analysis on PSG's latest 2-1 triumph over Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on the UEFA website about the game, Carrick said: \"It sounds very basic but the key to the game is one-twos, third-man runs and forward runs behind.",
      "\"There was so much focus on pressing forward and relying on regaining it in that direction. But as we saw, the downside of this is there is a lot of space behind and across the back line.",
      "\"It's great if you win the ball back or if the other team keep passing to feet and trying to keep possession but it leaves you exposed against a team that is happy to run and pass less. It's runs in behind that were rewarded.\"",
      "Man United have reportedly drawn up a three-man shortlist to replace Amorim, if they do part ways with the Portuguese head coach, with Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner and Gareth Southgate said to be on that list.",
      "Speaking to the The Athletic in 2023, Solskjaer backed his former coach to be the manager at Old Trafford one day.",
      "\"I am 100% sure that Michael will be the manager of Manchester United if he wants to be,\" he said.",
      "\"I cannot see him not being the Manchester United manager. He's a winner, a massive winner, yet he stays in control of his emotions.",
      "\"He knows what he wants and doesn't lose his rag. He'll never be emotional and fight with the players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is facing one of the most crucial matches of his managerial career as Manchester United prepare to take on Sunderland this weekend. The week has been a tough one for Amorim, who has faced significant criticism following United's 3-1 loss to struggling Brentford.",
      "However, the club's stance could quickly shift if newly-promoted Sunderland manage to beat United this weekend. Luckily for Amorim, he will have three players available for Sunderland's visit who were absent for the previous match.",
      "Firstly, there's Amad. The Ivorian unfortunately missed the Brentford match due to a bereavement.",
      "Amad has since returned to Carrington and resumed training with the first-team squad. It's anticipated that the 23-year-old, who has played as a right wing-back and No.10 this season, will be back in the starting line-up against the Black Cats.",
      "The match holds particular significance for Amad due to his successful loan spell at the Stadium of Light, which led to his promotion to United's first team. He can expect a warm welcome from the away fans on Saturday.",
      "Casemiro is also back in contention for selection this weekend after serving his one-match ban following a red card in the victory over Chelsea. The Brazilian was dismissed for a second bookable offence.",
      "Having served his suspension, Amorim might be tempted to field him in the centre against Sunderland, possibly replacing either Bruno Fernandes or Manuel Ugarte. Another fresh option for Amorim is Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Eyebrows were raised earlier this week when the Dutchman was brought back into the first-team squad by Amorim, despite being the only player deemed surplus to requirements who didn't leave Old Trafford this summer. His lack of pre-season training will almost certainly mean he won't start against Sunderland, but there's a good chance he could make the bench for the Reds this weekend.",
      "Amorim will be hoping that the increased options in his squad will fuel competition and, consequently, yield a positive result on Saturday.",

      "That being said, things can shift rapidly in football and a defeat to newly-promoted Sunderland could entirely alter the situation. If United were to conclude that Xavi was the right person to lead the club forward, they could be in luck.",

Despite his insistence to stay out of management for now, Marca explained that it seemed to be only a matter of time before Xavi returned to the dugout.",
      "The Spanish press suggests that the manager is only likely to return to the dugout for a top-tier club. However, there's a worry for United as Xavi's coaching experience seems to be solely based in Spain and the Middle East, thus, bringing on board the World Cup winner could be seen as a gamble.",

It's believed that Orozco's performances at the recent Under-17 South American Championship were excellent.",

Saturday's crushing defeat at Brentford has cranked up the heat on the United chief, with numerous reports suggesting Amorim could be heading for the exit door if things don't improve.",
      "Whilst the manager remains in his post for now, question marks hang over his future should United stumble against Sunderland this weekend. Several candidates have been touted for the United hot seat if Amorim gets his marching orders, with Glasner amongst the frontrunners after his remarkable work at Palace.",
      "\"He's a brilliant manager,\" the pundit acknowledged. \"He doesn't get too up and doesn't get too down.",
      "\"It's very impressive. He's put a team together and they are all very comfortable in their positions.",
      "\"Everyone knows their job in the team. Let's say Ruben Amorim was manager at Palace now, he'd have half a chance of being a success.",
      "\"Palace have the players to play three at the back. They have the attributes in their squad to play in that system.",
      "\"For me, that's why I'd be concerned about Glasner going to Man United. He's a three-at-the-back man and it is being proven that it is a system that just doesn't fit the players at Man United.",
      "\"Glasner is not a good fit for Man United. Of course, I'm sure he'd be adaptable, and he's proven with how he handles the players, but the system he uses is just all wrong for United - Amorim can tell you that.\"",
      "Merson's comments came as it emerged that Glasner declined a new contract at Palace back in the summer, as per BBC Sport. Glasner was unhappy with Palace's approach in the transfer market, and the club's chances of keeping hold of him beyond the end of the season are now reportedly deemed 'remote' following internal talks.",
      "Should Glasner not be in the running for the hotseat at Old Trafford, other potential candidates for the United position include former England boss Gareth Southgate, ex-Barcelona chief Xavi and AFC Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola.

With no European football this season, there was added emphasis on domestic success, but defeat by League Two Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and a stuttering start in the Premier League has seen his position questioned again.",

Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team were behind the appointment of Amorim, who they believed was a coup, having been so successful with Sporting.",

      "Solskjaer is also a proud United alumni, having scored 126 goals in 366 games as a player and won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League. Even under the dire circumstances in which he was sacked as manager, the statement United released showed the depth of feeling between the two parties.",
      "“Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,” the statement said. “Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future.",
      "“His place in the club’s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.”",
      "Solskjaer is once again available, having been sacked by Besiktas in August after seven months with the Turkish club and was reportedly back in the Manchester area this week. While United insist they haven’t lined up replacements for Amorim, who faces a crucial game against Sunderland on Saturday, they know the Norwegian would be interested in the job.",
      "Speaking at Oslo Business Forum last year, Solskjaer underlined his feelings on the job. \"If the family (United) asks, I would say yes every day of the week,\" he said. \"It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",

      "Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez could be lured to Manchester United if Ruben Amorim is given the boot, according to former Premier League ace Gaizka Mendieta.",
      "Amorim's reign at Old Trafford has been far from smooth sailing since he took over the reins in November, following Erik ten Hag's departure. The 40-year-old manager led the Red Devils to a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season and this term hasn't started much better.",
      "With just two wins from their first six league matches and a humiliating Carabao Cup second-round exit against Grimsby Town, the pressure is mounting on Amorim. This has sparked rumours about his future, with several high-profile names being touted as potential replacements - including Xavi.",
      "Xavi, who boasts an impressive eight La Liga titles with Barcelona both as a player and a manager, has been out of work since Hansi Flick replaced him at Camp Nou last May. Despite only having five years of managerial experience, Mendieta, a former team-mate at club and international level, believes Xavi would relish the opportunity to bring success back to United.",
      "In a chat with OLGB, the ex-Valencia and Middlesbrough star said of Xavi: \"I think if it's the right project, he will be tempted. Who doesn't want to coach in the Premier League?",
      "\"Who would not want to coach Manchester United, even if it's in a difficult time? He won trophies at Barca during a very peculiar period of history of the club and he changed that.",
      "\"Of course, he doesn't know Manchester United as he knows Barca, but he's been there, he knows that, he's capable of doing those things. So if the project seems right to him, I'm sure he will take it.",
      "\"He's been preparing himself already, waiting for the chance to come. I know he's had a few options to go and coach, but it wasn't the right project.",
      "\"I think for a coach like him, it's the project that matters, not only the history and the club. A lot of people were hesitant in his move to Barca because he had only been in Qatar.",
      "\"People thought he wasn't ready, then he won the league and the Super Cup in his first season. I think football has changed a lot. The coaches and players tend to adapt.",
      "\"It's at an incredibly high level and it's a lot faster because people are more prepared. There's more tools out there for coaches to gain an understanding, knowing what's happening at other clubs and with other players.",
      "\"He has his own platforms to understand and analyse situations. So wherever he goes, which could be Man Utd, he'll be prepared for the job he takes for sure.\"",
      "Whilst there has been no indication that Amorim is presently in danger of losing his position, the hierarchy will undoubtedly expect swift improvements in form, with ambitions of bringing an end to a decade of disappointment at Old Trafford.",
      "With a challenging line-up of matches against newly promoted Sunderland, reigning champions Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest, and Tottenham on the horizon, Amorim's United squad will have their work cut out as they strive to regain momentum.",

      "Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after a disappointing start to the season for Manchester United. The Portuguese has only managed to secure 19 victories from 49 games during his first 11 months at the helm.",
      "Despite guiding the team to the Europa League final, he has struggled to make an impact on the domestic front. After a dismal 15th-place finish in the 2024/25 season, United are currently languishing in 14th position this term, with a mere two wins from six matches.",
      "If Amorim gets the boot, Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down any offer from United. The former England manager was previously one of the top candidates to take over at United in March 2024.",
      "Although Southgate's commitment to England ahead of the European Championship put a stop to United's plans to enter discussions at that time, he is currently without a club. However, the Daily Star reports that Southgate is in no hurry to return to football and is keeping his options open.",
      "Interestingly, Southgate is good mates with Dan Ashworth. The former United sporting director had a long-term plan to bring Southgate to Old Trafford during his tenure, but left after just five months.",
      "\"He's been in the hot seat for coming up to a year, and he's had a transfer window, but you can't see any signs of improvement. There have been one or two matches where we've seen flashes of potential; they [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager conduct their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",
      "\"But you're not telling me he shouldn't be doing better, even with that system. You look at the players at the back - Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire - Bruno Fernandes going forward, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got good players.",
      "\"It doesn't look like the right fit, and that's putting it mildly. There's a lot of talk that they're not going to sack him until a certain date towards the end of this year to save a pay-off. It's difficult to read the minds of the hierarchy at United as to what they're thinking, but I think they know, and everyone will be telling them that it is time for a change.\"",
      "Few seem convinced that Amorim's position remains secure, with journalist Fabrizio Romano indicating that, whilst the manager won't face immediate dismissal, forthcoming fixtures could prove decisive. \"I'm not here saying that Amorim is absolutely safe,\" he said.",
      "\"Amorim's job is not absolutely safe at the moment because they need to perform in a different way because Man United want to see results. But it doesn't mean that Manchester United have met with Southgate or already started the process to appoint Gareth Southgate as new boss.",
      "\"So let's wait, let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim might have just one additional month to persuade United bosses he deserves backing. Reports previously suggested that United could postpone any dismissal of Amorim until he completes a year in charge, owing to the significant compensation package he would be entitled to.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United would face a substantial £12m bill should they axe the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in charge. Conversely, there are worries that Amorim might be the one to trigger his departure.",
      "United's co-owners, Ineos, are reportedly concerned that their manager could opt to quit before facing the sack in an attempt to protect his managerial standing. He is reputed to grow increasingly exasperated by the relentless criticism following defeats.",
      "As per The i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are ready to back their manager, but Amorim may soon need to consider resigning to 'preserve his managerial career'. The United boss believes that evaluations of United's losses can be 'knee-jerk' reactions and is allegedly surprised by the intense scrutiny over his managerial tenure.",

      "Oliver Glasner’s future at Crystal Palace is uncertain after the Austrian declined the chance to sign a new contract with the club. Glasner is hot property right now, having masterminded Palace’s FA Cup final win and made an unbeaten start to the season, with Manchester United among the interested onlookers.",
      "The 51-year-old has been in charge of Palace since February 2024, when he replaced Roy Hodgson, and has completely changed the club’s trajectory. He has lost just 15 of his 71 matches in charge of the Eagles, bringing a first major trophy in their history by beating Manchester City at Wembley in May.",
      "The fact that captain Marc Guehi’s contract expires on June 30 has been well documented after the defender saw a £35million move to Liverpool collapse on deadline day. But Glasner is in the same boat, with his contract also only having nine months left on it.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Glasner was offered a contract extension over the summer, yet he declined to sign it, preferring to wait until the end of the transfer window. Glasner was openly critical of Palace’s approach in the transfer market and threatened to resign if the club sold Guehi without finding a replacement.",
      "Palace’s low-key window could ultimately lead to Glasner’s departure because it didn’t match his personal ambitions. The club brought in just five players, two of whom came on free transfers, and only Yeremy Pino has made an impact so far this season.",
      "The chances of Palace keeping Glasner beyond the end of the season are reportedly deemed ‘remote’ following internal discussions. The club will try to persuade him otherwise, but it seems that he could jump ship to a different club who are able to match the success he had at Eintracht Frankfurt, where he won the Europa League in 2022.",
      "Manchester United are keeping an eye on Glasner, who would be a good fit were they to replace Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss has won just 18 of his 49 games in charge and is under huge pressure following the 3-1 defeat by Brentford last weekend which left United 14th in the Premier League with two wins from their opening six games.",
      "While Glasner is being considered as a potential replacement, United stress that they remain committed to Amorim ahead of a crunch match against Sunderland on Saturday afternoon. The fact that the Austrian is coming to the end of his deal and plays a similar three-man defence makes him an obvious target for Ineos should they sack Amorim.",

      "Rashford, 27, joined Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United in the summer, after Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't part of his plans. The Catalan giants have the option to make Rashford's move permanent for a cool £30million in 2026.",
      "After a shaky start at Barcelona, Rashford has found his stride since the September international break. In fact, he's either scored or assisted in each of his last six matches for Barca.",
      "The England striker netted his first and second goals for Barca against Newcastle United in the Champions League last month, while he's set up one goal in five of his last six appearances across all competitions.",
      "On Wednesday, Rashford set up Ferran Torres to score the first goal against Paris Saint-Germain in Europe's top club competition. However, despite Rashford's latest contribution to the scoreboard, Sherwood compared him to teammate and Spanish sensation Lamine Yamal.",
      "\"When it goes out to the left to Marcus, he is one dimensional, we know what Marcus is and he's very effective when he does it. He knocks it, he runs past people and when he doesn't the crowd think, 'why don't you give us the same as the genius on the other side?'\"",
      "\"It's harsh on him (Rashford) I know, but it's a very difficult environment for him to play in. Marcus Rashford will develop if he wants to and get better playing in this Barcelona side. He has to get better.\"",
      "Sherwood joked: \"At the moment, he looks bang average because the kid on the other side is so good.\"",
      "Hansi Flick has been delighted with Rashford's adjustment to Barcelona, telling Marca: \"Everyone could see it in the last games. In Newcastle [scoring two goals] he gained a lot of confidence.",

And if you can do that, you are first disappointed with yourself, and then also with the team and the whole result, so really disappointed.\"",

      "Speaking about the players taking responsibility, De Ligt said: \"I mean it's always easy to look to the manager, but in the end, the players on the pitch have to do it. We can't say the goals we conceded, or the chances we conceded, are because of what... I don't know, you guys always talk about the system.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund scored twice for Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday night.",
      "Hojlund showcased his pace to get in behind Sporting Lisbon's backline for the first goal, and finished brilliantly with a header to win the game for Napoli after a Sporting equaliser.",
      "Speaking after the game, Kevin De Bruyne compared Hojlund to Erling Haaland, which begs the question: why do players improve significantly when they leave Manchester United?",
      "Scott McTominay has been a revelation at Napoli. McTominay opened up on life in Naples during an interview this year, and he's clearly a fan of the food on offer. \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. Bellissimo,\" he said. \"I never ate them at home, they are just red water. Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. It is all so fresh. It’s incredible.\"",
      "Could Hojlund's improvement be down to a diet of freshly picked tomatoes from the hills of southern Italy? Is there a curse at Old Trafford that makes it impossible to perform?",
      "McTominay was named Serie A's player of the year as Napoli won the Scudetto last season. He smoked a cigarette as the team bus paraded and was subsequently nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Marcus Rashford recently scored twice for Barcelona in their win against Newcastle in the Champions League. His first goal was stunning and he picked up the man of the match award.",
      "Anthony Elanga left United a few years ago, and he's just picked up a Champions League man of the match award for his excellent performance for Newcastle against Union Saint-Gilloise.",
      "Antony has been given his own clothing line by Real Betis and their sporting director has described him as the \"most important signing\" in the Spanish club's history.",
      "The Brazilian re-signed for Betis on transfer deadline day and was mobbed by hundreds of fans at the airport upon his arrival in Seville. Antony was pictured hanging out of a chauffeur-driven car and waving to supporters.",
      "United fans have been left scratching their heads, flummoxed at the success of former players. It has become almost inevitable that an ex-United player will improve when they depart the club.",
      "In April, Amorim was asked about it after Elanga haunted his former club. \"They had the chance here,\" Amorim insisted. \"At Manchester United, you don’t have the time. I will not have the time.",
      "\"We have to get it right fast. You are not talking about players that didn’t play for Manchester United, they were here playing for Manchester United. In here, the pressure is too big sometimes and sometimes you don’t get time and you should have time for these kids to develop.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag frequently discussed the \"pressure\" of representing United. The Dutchman wanted to add personalities who could deal with that pressure when he was appointed from Ajax.",
      "There are perhaps four reasons to explain why United players go on to thrive after leaving the club. And none of them are linked to Italian tomatoes or a curse.",
      "The first point is that United overpay for practically every signing. That is often their fault - the price for Antony rocketed during talks with Ajax and United agreed to their demands - but sometimes it's because the sellers know they are dealing with England's biggest club, a commercial juggernaut.",
      "Selling clubs know United splash the cash each summer and try to get every penny they can. Invariably, this leads to players arriving for huge transfer fees, bringing added scrutiny.",
      "Antony was signed in an £86m deal and Hojlund was signed in a package worth £72m. They were worth half of those fees, and the price tags increased expectation levels.",
      "That does not help new signings perform. The second reason is that the scrutiny at United is unrivalled in Britain. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona are scrutinised more in Europe. United make international headlines after every game and the headlines have mostly not been positive in the last 12 years.",
      "Some players have the skillset to deal with the intense scrutiny, but others crumble under the spotlight, so it's liberating for them to leave Manchester and escape for a fresh start.",
      "A third possible reason - but one that does not apply to players who leave for fellow Premier League clubs - is that players sometimes leave United to play in weaker leagues. Napoli and Barcelona compete in the Champions League, of course, but they face weaker sides in their respective divisions, which makes it easier for former United players to rack up better numbers.",
      "The final point is that, despite a few domestic trophy wins, United have been a mess across the last decade. The club has often been in crisis, so the players who leave walk into more organised teams.",
      "The combination of not having to deal with such a huge price tag, dealing with less pressure, playing in a weaker league and operating in a more organised team is the perfect recipe for improvement.",
      "It's probably more fun to suggest there is a curse at Old Trafford, though.",

As per the Sun, sources suggest that the boyhood United fan would need assurance that the top brass would stick to any long-term goals planned.",
      "Newcastle United legend Shearer has offered a damning assessment of Amorim's tenure so far with United currently 14th in the top-flight table.",

      "But their summer business has forced Fernandes to be deployed in a deeper position on the pitch so far this season. The Portuguese is widely regarded as United's best signing in a fallow period since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",

      "Man United legend Michael Carrick has landed a surprise new role with UEFA amid ongoing pressure on Ruben Amorim to deliver results.",
      "The 44-year-old former Middlesbrough boss has been linked with a surprise return to Old Trafford as interim boss, should the Man United hierarchy choose to part ways with the Portuguese head coach. It's a role he's worked in before having acted as caretaker manager following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's departure from the club. Carrick's first game in charge was a win over Villarreal in the Champions League and he also picked up a 3-2 win over Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick was appointed as Boro boss in October 2022 and guided them to the Championship play-off semi-final at the end of that season, where they were beaten by Coventry City. Now, just a few months on, Carrick has been appointed as a UEFA Technical Observer and recently gave his expertise on PSG's recent 2-1 win over Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on the UEFA website, Carrick said: \"It sounds very basic but the key to the game is one-twos, third-man runs and forward runs behind. There was so much focus on pressing forward and relying on regaining it in that direction.",
      "\"But as we saw, the downside of this is there is a lot of space behind and across the back line. It's great if you win the ball back or if the other team keep passing to feet and trying to keep possession but it leaves you exposed against a team that is happy to run and pass less. It's runs in behind that were rewarded.\"",
      "Manchester United could be convinced to hire Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner to replace Ruben Amorim thanks to a forgotten factor surrounding his Selhurst Park contract.",
      "Amorim's future is shrouded in uncertainty after a poor start to the campaign. Last weekend's defeat at Brentford increased the pressure exponentially on the Portuguese head coach.",
      "However, a defeat at home to Sunderland on Saturday could change this picture drastically. One of the names to be linked with a move to Old Trafford should Amorim leave is Glasner.",
      "The Palace head coach has worked wonders having led them to the FA Cup last season and an unbeaten Premier League start this campaign. While his CV is impressive, the cost implications on hiring the Austrian will also appeal to the Reds.",
      "Read more here.",
      "FourFourTwo claim that Como boss and Arsenal legend Cesc Fabregas, who also played in the Premier League for Chelsea, is under consideration by United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The Spaniard has previously claimed that the club tried to sign him twice as a player before – as a 15-year-old prior to his Gunners move, and over a decade later, when he was leaving Barcelona.",
      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faces a must-win game at home to Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "After Saturday's abject 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which left United in 14th place with just seven points from 18, Amorim's position as head coach is under serious threat.",
      "United insist Amorim retains the full backing of those in charge and have rejected suggestions they are already looking at potential candidates to replace him.",
      "Read more here",
      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno Fernandes? If you're Ruben Amorim, you continue to play him in midfield and bury your head in the sand.",
      "The notion of Fernandes - captain and unquestionably Manchester United's most accomplished and inspirational player - being a problem is, on the face of it, an absurd notion.",
      "Last season Fernandes saved United from the ignominy of a relegation battle, eight goals and 11 assists in the Premier League making him the stand-out player in Amorim's woeful squad.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Alan Shearer has agreed with Gary Neville over concerns around Ruben Amorim's management at Manchester United.",
      "\"It was alarming what he was doing, [against Brentford] the players he was moving around,\" he told the Rest is Football.",
      "\"Moving the right centre-back into [central] centre-back, Mbeumo was right wing-back then Mason Mount was in the 10 for four minutes then Zirkzee come on and moved Mount to left wing-back.\"",
      "Read more here",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would turn down an offer from Manchester United if Ruben Amorim were to be dismissed. Back in March 2024, when Erik ten Hag's position was under scrutiny, Southgate was a top candidate for the role at United.",
      "However, Southgate remained committed to his duties with England, leading the team to the final of that summer's European Championships. Despite United's interest, Southgate declined all overtures.",
      "Ten Hag managed to secure the FA Cup and was given a stay of execution before lasting until October, where he was then replaced by Amorim following Ruud van Nistelrooy's short-term interim stint. Following England's impressive performance at the Euros in Germany, Southgate chose to step down and has since taken a hiatus from football.",
      "Read more here",
      "Ahead of this weekend's encounter at Old Trafford, Sunderland's manager Regis Le Bris has given his verdict on the upcoming fixture.",
      "In his pre-match press conference, Le Bris explained:",
      "Being at Old Trafford demands strong personality and strong character. I still believe that we’ll need to upgrade our performance to be competitive in Manchester. They are strong, create many chances from everywhere, direct play in behind, set pieces, with talented players. Now it’s just a question of click, confidence, circumstances, scenario. So for us the only thing we can control is our way of playing, the way we want to play this game, to face this challenge, being aware that it will be tough.",
      "Glasner is one of the favourites to succeed Amorim if the Portuguese were to leave Old Trafford.",
      "And an approach for the Austrian could be of interest to the Reds.",
      "For one, he has started the season exceptionally at Palace. He is also thought to be unsure at staying at Selhurst Park where his contract expires at the end of this campaign.",
      "This ultimately means agreeing terms with Glasner would not cost much as compensation owed would be minimal to hire him immediately.",
      "While rumours swirl around his future, it is business as usual for Amorim on the training ground.",
      "In fact, Amorim drafted up teenager Daniel Armer into the Carrington session this week to give him valuable experience of first-team football.",
      "The 17-year-old centre-back was drafted in just a week after Jayden Ngwashi was called into the training group.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Back in July, Marca insisted that it would be only a matter of time before Xavi returned to management.",
      "A move to another Spanish club, other than Barcelona, is off the table.",
      "And while his agent has rejected offers from English and German clubs to date, it is believed he will dip his toe back into management soon.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are still backing Amorim despite the defeat to Brentford.",
      "It is understood that no alternatives are being weighed up for the United job at present.",
      "However, that was the second time that the Reds' hierarchy have needed to clarify their commitment to keeping the Portuguese.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Despite Merson suggesting that Glasner would not be the right fit for United, it is understood by BBC Sport that the chances of the Austrian staying at Palace are 'remote'.",
      "It is understood that he has been offered a new contract by his current club but has chosen not to sign it yet after what was deemed to be a difficult summer transfer window.",
      "Glasner's current contract ends at the end of this season.",

      "Well that is the opinion of former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson anyway.",
      "Let's say Ruben Amorim was manager at Palace now, he'd have half a chance of being a success. Palace have the players to play three at the back. They have the attributes in their squad to play in that system. For me, that's why I'd be concerned about Glasner going to Man United. He's a three-at-the-back man and it is being proven that it is a system that just doesn't fit the players at Man United.",
      "Hello all and welcome back to the United blog as we continue to move ever closer to this weekend's final match before the international.",
      "I'm Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through the next few hours with all the latest Amorim news and other bits surrounding the Reds.",
      "To bring you up to speed, if you are just joining us, here is what you have missed surrounding the club so far today:",
      "Man United are targeting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba regardless of Amorim's future, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "The Reds tried to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to reach a deal due to Brighton's high asking price. While Amorim is believed to be a big admirer, the report claims United are still set to pursue a move for the 21-year-old, regardless of whether the manager remains in charge.",
      "It is also claimed they could make a formal approach for his services next year. Liverpool are reportedly tracking the youngster as well.",
      "Another step away from the manager talk and this one is different.",
      "The Athletic have reported that Man United are in talks over a possible mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia. The report claims the club are considering using their spare period to travel abroad with opponents being explore.",
      "A game cannot be arranged until the Premier League match dates have been decided."

      "“I think at times we drop a bit our consistency. In some games, offensively or defensively, we have had some really good spells, so just keep working and try to get some details.\"",

      "Gus Poyet has defended Ruben Amorim amidst Manchester United's recent struggles, urging supporters to stop drawing comparisons between the club's current state and its glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Amorim has found it challenging to steer United back on course following Erik ten Hag's departure last November, culminating in a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season - albeit, with a largely inherited team.",
      "The 40-year-old's difficulties seem to have carried over into the new campaign, with United languishing in 14th place in the league standings despite significant summer investments, including the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"You know, it's bad, the situation. But I'm not going to try to be the defending...the judge of the coaches, or the lawyer of the coaches. But Manchester United is confirmed - after Ruben Amorim, it is confirmed that the problem is not the coaches.",
      "\"I'm sorry. Okay, I know it sounds too defensive from the coaches. But when you have six, seven, eight, forget it. Because you have all the characteristics of coaches.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Poyet also called on United supporters to stop drawing comparisons between the current Red Devils setup and Ferguson's era, during which, the Scot secured 13 Premier League titles, 19 domestic trophies and two Champions League crowns throughout his remarkable 27-year tenure.",
      "He added: \"And one of the biggest things I would say to people in England is stop comparing Man Utd with Alex Ferguson's Man Utd. It's gone, it's finished, it's over.",
      "\"That was a great time for them. They enjoyed[it], they had an unbelievable club, an unbelievable coach. Finished, see you later. You cannot be the same forever. You cannot, it's impossible. Because things change. And they try with the coaches and it's not working with the coaches.",
      "\"So they need to go a little bit deeper maybe. Because I have to be realistic and say that it doesn't matter who you take now. It doesn't matter. That is not the solution, okay.",
      "\"They can do a little bit better, yeah, but the situation here is not to do a little bit better. It's unfortunately changing systems, changing players, mentality, you know, it doesn't work.\"",
      "A host of names have been touted as potential successors at Manchester United, should Amorim face the sack. Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler are among those mentioned, along with former England manager Gareth Southgate, and La Liga icons Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez.",

      "United have taken just seven points from their first six league games. A dire 2024/25 campaign meant a fast start was needed this season but United have struggled to pick up points.",
      "A 2-1 victory over Chelsea lifted the mood at Old Trafford and it was hoped the result could kickstart United's season. However, any momentum they were looking to build was soon squashed by the 3-1 defeat at Brentford last weekend.",
      "Should United part ways with Amorim, Howe has been mentioned as a possible replacement. Gareth Southgate is also said to be in the running, with Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner the favourite.",
      "Howe was asked at his pre-match press conference on Friday about the speculation linking him with United if Amorim is sacked. \"I'm all in (at Newcastle). My commitment here is 100% here and always has been. My family is still here, and we are fighting every day to make a success of what we are doing,\" he said.",
      "\"The season ahead could be a wonderful thing, and that is what we are trying to focus on, trying to make a success of the games we have coming up.\"",
      "United face Sunderland on Saturday knowing they need a win to lift the mood at Old Trafford ahead of the international break.",
      "Amorim will speak to the media this afternoon and will no doubt be asked about his future at the club. You can get all the updates from Amorim in our live press conference blog.",

      "Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given believes Ruben Amorim has reason to panic about his Manchester United future during the international break.",
      "United host Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon, with the fixture being a must-win game for the under-pressure Red Devils head coach. Despite spending heavily on new additions in the summer, Amorim’s side have started the campaign as poorly as they ended last season.",
      "They are currently down in 14th place following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford last weekend, which marked their third league loss of the season already. With the defeat coming straight off the back of a narrow win against Chelsea, the Portuguese is still yet to secure back-to-back league victories with United, summing up the rollercoaster and emotionally taxing nature of his almost year-long tenure for everyone involved with the club.",
      "United’s minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team will have plenty to ponder regardless of the Sunderland result this weekend, after which there's the international break. Whether they decide to persist with Amorim or cut their losses and start again with a new appointment remains to be seen.",
      "However, former Premier League goalkeeper Given has issued Amorim a warning by highlighting how football club owners often make decisions to sack managers during international breaks, claiming that's the time when they get “twitchy.”",
      "The pundit told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction: “In terms of Amorim’s future… look, it’s Sunderland next, and you’d have to say that’s a huge game for him and the team, at home. If he doesn’t win that, then I’d imagine he’ll be under severe pressure. Especially because after that game, it’s Liverpool away, after the international break, and you can’t see much coming from that.",
      "“And most managers will tell you, if they’re under pressure and there’s an international break coming up, you’re panicking a little bit about your future. A lot of owners get a bit twitchy, especially when there’s a break in the calendar and things aren’t going well… you can’t stress how important that Sunderland game is for Amorim’s future, really.",
      "“If I’m being honest, I really hope he pulls through, because he comes across as a really charismatic guy with a lot of good traits. He’s got personality, he’s got a glint in his eye which I feel like a lot of previous managers haven’t had.",
      "“But he’ll know this is a results business; it’s about getting points on the board and climbing up the table. He’s had a full pre-season with the team now and he’s been able to bring in a lot of players this summer, but we haven’t seen an improvement in results…”",
      "Amorim’s future has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. The sight of the dejected manager hunched on the sidelines and clutching his head in his hands has become synonymous with his tenure.",
      "Various reports have suggested the likes of Xavi, Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner have been lined up as replacements, which, if true, would signal the end of his Old Trafford nightmare.",
      "But Amorim for now insists he is unconcerned about his future, saying after the Brentford loss: “I am never concerned about my job. I am not that kind of guy. It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.”",

      "\"I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but I guess Zidane is sitting, waiting for a huge job where he's got the potential to go and win things. I don't think that potential is at Man United for a few years yet, so I'd be really surprised if Zidane was to go to Man United.",

      "Gareth Southgate would reportedly demand time and patience from the Manchester United board if he succeeds Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former England manager is said to be debating whether United would be a good fit, in the event that the current head coach is let go. However, it's suggested that Southgate would have concerns about joining the club and would require a four-year commitment to turn things around - a timeframe the board may not be prepared to offer.",
      "According to The Sun, sources indicate that the lifelong United supporter would need assurances that the senior management would adhere to any long-term objectives set. The report also suggests that Southgate is worried that the board would expect immediate success from him, whereas his approach focuses on steady progress over an extended period.",
      "The 55-year-old has been unemployed since resigning as England manager last summer, after leading the Three Lions to second place at Euro 2024 - losing 2-1 to Spain in the final. However, the ex-Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough star-turned-head coach has been linked with a managerial position at United since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in the club last February.",
      "The MEN understands he has serious reservations about accepting the job. Southgate isn't the only name linked with taking over from Amorim either.",
      "Palace's Oliver Glasner and Brighton's Fabian Hurzeler are rumoured to be in the running for the Old Trafford hot seat should Amorim leave, while football legends Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez have also been mentioned, reports the Mirror.",
      "Despite this, there's no indication that United are planning to part ways with Amorim as he nears his first anniversary at the helm. The Portuguese manager took charge after Erik ten Hag was sacked last October, but could only steer the club to a disappointing 15th place in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim was given some leeway due to the fact he largely worked with the squad he inherited from Ten Hag, but he won't be given the same allowances this season. That's because the Red Devils' board backed him significantly in the summer transfer window to make changes to fit his preferred 3-5-3 formation, as well as providing a full pre-season tour to get his team in shape.",
      "Despite a poor performance, Amorim was given some leeway as he largely worked with the squad he inherited from his Dutch predecessor. However, this time around, the 40-year-old won't have the same excuses.",
      "Southgate hasn't managed in the Premier League since Middlesbrough's relegation from the top tier of English football in 2009. Instead, he shifted his focus to international management with England in 2013, initially taking charge of the U21 side before being promoted to the first team three years later.",
      "Although he didn't secure a major trophy with the Three Lions, he successfully led them to runner-up finishes at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024, as well as a third-place finish in the UEFA Nations League in 2018/19.",

That was United's fourth defeat of the season already with the upcoming fixture against Sunderland now very important to relieve pressure on his job.",
      "Despite being beaten 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium, MEN Sport reported earlier this week that Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy with no replacement being lined-up.",
      "There was at the very least one positive from Saturday with Benjamin Sesko on target. He has joined fellow summer signing Bryan Mbeumo in scoring his first goal for the club, but Matheus Cunha is still yet to find the back of the net.",
      "That attacking trio replaced the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United squad. Those five players were all deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim but some already look to be proving that decision wrong.",
      "Since re-joining Real Betis, Antony has picked up a goal and assist while Sancho has looked bright in cameos for Aston Villa. However, it is the impact of the remaining three in Champions League action that has spoken volumes all while United are preparing for their next game.",
      "Garnacho was pivotal to Chelsea's winning goal against Benfica on Tuesday with his cross turned into his own net by Richard Rios. The Argentine has since posted an Instagram story captioned: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "24 hours later, Rashford assisted Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a perfectly-weighted pass. The European champions ultimately won the game, but Rashford was a livewire throughout with another clear message sent to Amorim as that is the 27-year-old's sixth goal contribution since moving",

He was told it was now or never, and United had their man.",

      "It may well be that Amorim turns the ship around, but the United boss needs to starting picking up points and he needs to do it fast.",
      "Ratcliffe may want to forget about last season, but it's not that simple.",

      "Following an interception high up the pitch from Lamine Yamal and a quick counter, Rashford delivered a precise pass across the box, allowing Fermin Lopez to slot the ball into the bottom left corner. It was his fifth assist in nine games for the Spanish giants, having also scored twice along the way.",

The morale-boosting victory over Enzo Maresca's team was undone by Brentford, as they fell to a 3-1 defeat.",
      "\"Tough decisions and rumours are always part of this job so you have to accept it, you have to deal with it,\" Hurzeler said this week. \"But I really want to say that I have a lot of respect for Ruben Amorim so I won't talk about his job or any rumours that might come regarding him.",
      "\"I'm really privileged to be a coach for Brighton and Hove Albion, I'm very happy here and we still have a lot of work to do.\"",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the latest headlines as Amorim’s future continues to spark debate.",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down the opportunity to coach United, if Amorim was to be dismissed. Southgate is believed to not be in rush to return to football, but he is keeping his options open, reportedly within and beyond the sport.",
      "In March 2024, he emerged as a top candidate for the United job when Erik ten Hag's position was under threat, but he declined all approaches. Since leaving his role with England, Southgate has not returned to football, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work. He has also taken on a role hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "Additionally, talkSPORT reported that Southgate had emerged as one of three names on United's shortlist to potentially replace Amorim. But Fabrizio Romano has since dismissed those claims.",

      "However, going behind the Portuguese manager's back to contact other candidates could seriously undermine Amorim at a particularly tough time for the United boss.",
      "United are targeting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba regardless of Amorim's future, according to TEAMtalk. United tried to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to reach a deal due to Brighton's high asking price.",
      "The Seagulls reportedly sought a fee similar to the £115million they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023. While Amorim is believed to be a big admirer, the report claims United are still set to pursue a move for the 21-year-old, regardless of whether the manager remains in charge.",
      "It is also claimed they could make a formal approach for his services next year. Liverpool are reportedly tracking the youngster as well.",
      "MEN Sport says: Regardless of whether Amorim remains in charge of the club next season, United should still pursue Baleba, as he represents a long-term investment for the squad. His talent, versatility, and potential for growth make him a player who could influence the team for years to come - and United need more of that.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "“Most of the players want to turn things around; they believe that they can within this system, but there are exceptions within that dressing room, and that was the case also over the summer too.”",
      "Jacobs insists that is actually some of Amorim’s new summer signings who are the “most disillusioned” at Old Trafford so far this season.",
      "The journalist added: “I think, ironically, I’m told, but some of the new players in particular are the most disillusioned because the pitch that they were given tactically, in football terms, hasn’t yet matched up to the reality, so that’s quite intriguing.",
      "“As I’ve said many times, some of the new signings looked at the Manchester United squad, including some of the players that had gone, and thought one or two of those that have departed might also be quite conducive to their game.",
      "“Then you have Bruno Fernandes, who I wouldn’t call unhappy with his manager; if anything, they have got a positive relationship. He’s captain of the football club, but he’s unhappy with playing in that deeper role.”",
      "There have been claims that Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to give Amorim the full season but Jacobs reckons he may be given 38 Premier League matches from when he first joined.",
      "Jacobs continued: “Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around.",
      "“I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season.",
      "“I think more likely, from speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Gareth Southgate has been linked with taking over from Amorim, if Man Utd decide to sack him, but ex-Red Devils goalkeeper Ben Foster is unsure why the former England boss would want the role.",
      "Foster said on talkSPORT: “He’s got to be enjoying his life. Surely, for England, I don’t know why he would want to jump back into that frying pan, to be perfectly honest. Yeah, the answer for United, though, I honestly don’t know. I really don’t know.",
      "“I came on the show actually, I think it was probably about a month ago. I actually said maybe they do something like a Gareth Southgate. The only reason why I say that is because everything else just doesn’t seem to work.",
      "“So maybe you’ve got to adopt a different approach. But I think the person that has the answer for what Manchester United need is going to be the person that earns the big bucks because it’s it’s a very difficult question to answer.”",

      "Jude Bellingham has been both AXED and DROPPED by England after Thomas Tuchel REFUSED an obvious request. Gareth Southgate has some shock Man Utd demands.",
      "As one of precious few individuals to manage the seemingly impossible feat of winning back-to-back games as a Premier League coach, Gareth Southgate is inevitably front and centre of any conversation surrounding Manchester United and Ruben Amorim.",
      "He really could be the next Manchester United manager. Probably not. But he could. And that is enough.",
      "The claim, however, is that he is hardly jumping at the chance. Southgate has his reservations, perhaps because it would be difficult to persuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe to spend £50m on Kieran Trippier.",
      "But someone in the Southgate camp has clearly been speaking to certain voices in the media, because…",
      "‘Southgate ‘lays out two demands’ to even consider Man Utd talks as pressure builds on Red Devils boss Amorim’ – Daily Mirror website.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate ‘insists on two Man Utd promises’ to replace Ruben Amorim if he’s sacked’ – Daily Star website.",
      "So what precisely is Southgate asking for? Only green M&Ms in his office? His initials emblazoned on a waistcoat? The suspense is killing us.",
      "‘Gareth Southgate would demand time and patience from Manchester United if he was to succeed Ruben Amorim.’",
      "Oh for fu…",
      "Come back to us when Gareth Southgate demands impatience and to be judged after a couple of games. Then you’ve got an actual story.",
      "",
      "‘More relevantly, the status quo from the United hierarchy has not changed. Amorim retains the backing of the United board and will do so until he is sacked.’",
      "Next week: Bruno Fernandes will remain captain until he is not.",
      "",
      "England squad announcement day offers brief respite from what has become an intensely competitive Premier League manager sack race.",
      "And it is absolutely, undeniably noteworthy that Jude Bellingham is not part of Thomas Tuchel’s selection.",
      "But a) he has not been ‘DROPPED’, and b) it is only really ‘a major shock’ if you have been paying no attention or are a tabloid journalist. In which case, Mediawatch offers its sincere condolences.",
      "John Cross writes that Bellingham ‘has been sensationally left out’ of the squad and Thomas Tuchel ‘has effectively admitted’ he was ‘DROPPED’.",
      "Well he wasn’t part of the last England squad due to injury, only made his return for Real Madrid after more than two months out following surgery on September 20, and has played precisely 100 minutes of football in his four appearances since.",
      "As Tuchel pointed out in a press conference, while Bellingham “wanted to be called up” he ultimately “lacked rhythm”.",
      "But does it really need to be explained why a player who has started one game for club and country in the last 86 days not being picked to potentially face Wales in a friendly or Latvia in a World Cup qualifier isn’t a particularly ‘massive surprise’?",
      "The ‘effective admittance’ from Tuchel was his quote asking the proverbial question: “Why not bring the same group in because they set the standards?” And, of course, not mentioning Bellingham or indeed any player specifically by name in his helpful clarification as to why Bellingham has been ‘DROPPED’.",
      "‘It also comes just two days after Bellingham was named as the England fans’ Player of the Year so this must be seen as a major shock,’ Cross adds, as if an award for performances last season bears any relevance whatsoever to a decision made based entirely on circumstances in October 2025.",
      "Bellingham not being picked is notable and interesting. But it is also completely explicable and understandable if given more than a moment’s thought.",
      "",
      "Bellingham had been both ‘AXED’ and ‘DROPPED’ according to the MailOnline, who say ‘Tuchel’s cryptic comments hint it’s INTENTIONAL’, as if he might have accidentally left him off the list initially.",
      "Tuchel also ‘REFUSED Jude Bellingham’s request,’ which is one way of interpreting a elite-level professional footballer predictably wanting to play football all the time and a manager making decisions based on more things than that one-eyed desire.",
      "The Mail are no doubt thrilled by Bellingham’s omission after laying into him throughout the last international break.",
      "And Craig Hope picks up where he left off with a lengthy opinion piece again calling out Bellingham’s ‘leading man syndrome’, ‘intimidatory manner’ and ‘ego’.",
      "‘Tuchel clearly feels a change of mindset is needed if they are to prosper together,’ he writes. Either that or Bellingham’s four appearances since returning from a quite significant surgery in the summer have totalled one minute, 19 minutes, 70 minutes and ten minutes respectively, and England have more than enough good players to not feel the need to take unnecessary risks over fitness and, as Tuchel said, “rhythm”.",
      "",
      "This line from Hope brings up a point worth reiterating far and wide considering some of the coverage Mediawatch has seen of the England squad announcement:",
      "‘[Tuchel] needs to know if [Bellingham] has listened. He needs to know the reaction after he branded the 22-year-old’s on-field demeanour ‘repulsive’ in June.’",
      "A couple of points.",
      "Tuchel didn’t ‘brand’ Bellingham’s ‘on-field demeanour ‘repulsive”. He said sometimes people on the outside “cannot see the nice and well-educated and well-behaved guy that I see and the smile. If he smiles, he wins everyone but sometimes you see the rage, the hunger and the fire and it comes out in a way that can be a bit repulsive. For example, for my mother when she sits in front of the TV.”",
      "And more importantly, Tuchel also apologised unreservedly for using that word “unintentionally”, adding: “I am experienced enough and should’ve known better, I should’ve done better. I thought I had a little more credit with you guys (the media) that I do all this in my second language.”",
      "Obviously not. We would apologise but it seems like they are completely ignored by the following month.",
      "",
      "And of course Henry Winter reckons Bellingham being left out is ‘baffling’. To be fair, everything must be confusing when you view life through the prism of the first half of Peter Beardsley’s debut season for Liverpool, 1987/88.",
      "One Liverpool supporter is particularly riled at the idea Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk have ‘downed tools’. Maybe Arne Slot’s transition will just take time.",
      "After consecutive Premier League defeats put an early end to Chelsea’s slim title hopes, Maresca is now of course on the verge of the sack at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Will Liverpool’s ‘mini-crisis’ become an actual crisis at Chelsea? One thing’s for sure: there’s absolutely nothing mini about the latest Big Weekend.",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Mo Salah’s failure to hit the ground running has been reflective of a Liverpool side yet to fully click this season."

      "Liverpool could reportedly make a move to sign long-term Man Utd target Jarrad Branthwaite with Ibrahima Konate looking likely to join Real Madrid.",
      "But two defeats in four days to Crystal Palace in the Premier League and Galatasaray in the Champions League have turned the mood slightly with previous poor displays now becoming an issue for some.",
      "Their midfield and defence have come under scrutiny with the performances of Konate one concern amongst a lot of supporters and pundits.",
      "Liverpool are one injury away from disaster with Giovanni Leoni potentially out for the full season and the Reds failing to get a deal for Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi over the line on deadline day.",
      "With Guehi’s contract up at the end of the season, Liverpool could face increased competition for his signature in the January transfer window and Everton’s Branthwaite – who has been the subject of bids from Man Utd in the past – is now an option.",
      "READ: Liverpool rue Salah contract as ‘ageing’ Van Dijk fails to handle ‘complete sh*t’",
      "Former Man Utd and Tottenham scout Mick Brown told Football Insider: “Branthwaite will certainly be on the radar at Liverpool.",
      "“I’d be very surprised if he was to move in January, Everton won’t want to let him go and he’s had this injury which he needs to recover from.",
      "“Clubs like Liverpool will be keeping an eye on that I’m sure, seeing how well he recovers and if he gets back to his best quickly because it’s another long layoff for him.",
      "“Plus, he’s a left-sided centre-back, and that’s the position Van Dijk plays in at the moment so bringing him in would do little to solve their problems.",
      "“But like I say, that interest will be there as a long-term option, and maybe he could come in and develop his game a bit more by learning from Van Dijk.",
      "“I just don’t see him as a replacement for Konate, and it would be a shock to see him leave Everton now.",
      "“I expect they’ll keep an eye on how he progresses over the rest of the season and then if they think there’s a position for him, that might be when they make a move.”",
      "MORE LIVERPOOL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Liverpool signing ‘offers nothing’ and ‘needs to be dropped’ long before ‘confused’ Wirtz\n👉 Forget goals, these numbers show it is time for Liverpool to be worried about Mo Salah\n👉 Champions League prize money table calculated with over £100m on offer to Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool",
      "Spanish website Defensa Central insists that ‘the media and agent world is practically 99% sure that Konaté will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons’.",
      "Despite not playing well this season, Real Madrid ‘has a lot of faith in his potential’ with Konate able to solve their ‘weakness’ at set-pieces and crosses.",
      "Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol slammed Konate’s performance in their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last weekend with the France international “unbelievably horrendous” in the first half.",
      "Nicol said on ESPN: “It would be really harsh to pull one person out, but I think the man that was at the start of it was Konate. He had an absolutely, unbelievably horrendous first half.",
      "“He couldn’t pass the ball properly, he kept giving fouls away, he got booked, he’s trying to fight Mateta. I know Konate’s a big lad but Mateta’s bigger than him and you’ve got to use your brains.",
      "“Unfortunately today Konate didn’t use any brains whatsoever. So, he kicked it off and it almost kind of spread like a disease after that. Everybody giving the ball away.",
      "“And when you give a ball away against Crystal Palace, it is really the thing they do best. They exploit mistakes from the opposition and then they get at you quickly going forward.",
      "“Only some poor finishing, particularly from Mateta, is the reason that Liverpool were still in this game at all.. The truth of the matter is that all of the things Liverpool didn’t do well today are the same things they haven’t done well all season… Liverpool’s backline just doesn’t look composed at all.",
      "“Yes, you would hope the midfield can stop the opposition getting at the backline as often as it does. But at the end of the day the backline is there to do the job and right now it doesn’t look comfortable anytime it is asked to defend – whether it is today or the previous games.",
      "“Liverpool might be sitting top of the league still but Arne Slot still has a lot of questions that need answering that he hasn’t quite found the answer to yet.”",

      "Liverpool attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz is currently in “puppy protection” at Anfield but the “stroking will diminish” soon enough.",
      "Liverpool look exposed in defence, muddled in attack and just generally not quite like a team of champions injected with a record investment of over £400m.",
      "It has been claimed that Liverpool would be “prepared to let” one key player “leave” the Premier League giants at some point in 2026.",
      "Liverpool could reportedly be on the brink of losing two players as Real Madrid have ‘secured two signings’ as Xabi Alonso has given his ‘approval’.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool are already ‘on the verge’ of ‘completing’ a ‘controversial’ transfer as they battle Manchester United for a signing."

      "Regular readers of these hallowed pages will know that our push for Premier League managerial sackings is generally limited to five, maybe six, reasons why they should be shown the door.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And still – at time of writing – Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. So we’ve come up with 20.",
      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it by now if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintains, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it’s not the system that’s the problem, and he’s not for moving.",
      "We don’t quite know why we’ve reached a point in professional football where a manager who can’t, or at least won’t, adapt is held up as some sort of misunderstood genius, but Amorim has been given a helluva lot of rope because of his stubbornness.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably sees a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats are far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That’s not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles are? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",
      "",
      "Only 11 Premier League managers have had a worse record after 33 games. Frank Lampard had the same tally at Everton.",
      "",
      "Like a p*ssed up bloke down the pub going nose to nose with you looking for any excuse for a rumble, he’s f***ing asking for it.",
      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continue to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed. And while that sounds very much like a £12m compensation saving, we can see Gary Neville now with his headset on explaining why someone quitting Manchester United before they quit on him is “the lowest of the low for the football club”.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirely of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "",
      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably already be out of the job if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we can’t fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "He’s made ten unenforced centre-back substitutions this season. Win, lose or draw, it doesn’t matter. Leny Yoro came on for Maguire on Saturday, started on the left side, forcing Matthijs de Ligt into the middle, then moved to the right when Mount came on for Luke Shaw, with Diogo Dalot moving into the back three.",
      "There’s a fair chance they didn’t know where they were supposed to be playing come the end of the game, and there’s no way the players walked off that pitch believing they’re in the hands of a measured tactician.",
      "",
      "Reports suggest sacking Amorim will cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund scored two goals in the Serie A side’s 2-1 win over Sporting in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "The first saw him burst through two defenders and latch on to a through ball from Kevin De Bruyne before sliding the ball between the goalkeeper’s legs; the second saw him put his head where it hurts to beat the ‘keeper to a De Bruyne cross.",
      "If you wanted a brace to showcase a Proper Striker it was just about perfect and the first goal in particular is the sort of run and finish many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from Hojlund when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim is making life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he comes up against as they know exactly how United are going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is second favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim has United playing is now so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club is no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at his possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat. It looked like the point of no return, and still does.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there have been plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day.",
      "",
      "Amorim is an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if Amorim wasn’t the manager, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, assisting a goal in each of his last four La Liga games and against PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim they’re currently making another in not sacking him.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported last month that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea will have outweighed a Brentford defeat in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they are. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim isn’t solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really is currently no-one more to blame for this mess. He has been, and will continue to be, a “disaster”.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed a “yardstick” that Man Utd are going to judge Ruben Amorim by as he divulges the “most disillusioned” players.",
      "Former Premier League manager Neil Warnock has said he will replace Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim for free after a latest sack update.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson insists Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner would not be “a good fit” for Man Utd with his system “all wrong” for the Red Devils.",
      "Manchester United are ‘more likely’ to get relegated than qualify for Europe, so there should be zero debate over Ruben Amorim’s future…",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford."

      "United are still failing to break their bleak Groundhog Day cycle, with the fallen Premier League giant back to square one following a dreadful year under Amorim.",
      "The 40-year-old was given a lot of grace in his first few months at Man Utd as he did not receive nearly enough criticism for last season’s dire decline en route to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "There were excuses aplenty and pleas for more time in and out of the club so Amorim could build a squad equipped to thrive in his 3-4-3 formation over a couple of transfer windows, with optimistic (or naive) supporters getting giddy in the summer as the club spent over £200m on new attackers and signed a new goalkeeper.",
      "But folks, it has been Groundhog Day once again as the Red Devils have capitulated at the earliest sign of adversity, with three Premier League losses in six games and the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town exposing their lack of progress.",
      "READ: The five people most to blame for the Manchester United mess",
      "So far, there has been zero improvement in attacking areas following their £200m overhaul, while United remain just as ineffective in the other positions after overlooking the midfield department and signing another No.2 instead of an upgrade on Andre Onana in the summer.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd are getting no better, as his blank refusal to adapt to save face means he is dying on his sword, and the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked needs to be axed soon if the club are to salvage anything from this season, with this squad of players capable of much more provided there are a few tweaks.",
      "Really, Amorim should have already been and gone, but INEOS will surely have no choice but to get rid if they lose against newly-promoted Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Ahead of this game, ‘football statisticians at 247Bet’ have used a supercomputer to make predictions for the remainder of this season and for Man Utd, it makes for grim reading.",
      "According to the data, Man Utd ‘will finish the season on just 45 points’ to ‘progress to 14th place’, with this a three-point improvement on last campaign’s record low.",
      "The system also gave United ‘15% chance of relegation, a 0% chance of securing Champions League or Europa League football’, while they are ‘almost as likely to go down as 16% Sunderland’.",
      "It also says that the Red Devils should finish eight points clear of the bottom three, with Brentford, Wolves and Burnley backed to get relegated. So, there’s that at least…",
      "AI will eventually get to us all, but we at F365 have taken a hard line that supercomputers are bullsh*t and this one is the same.",
      "Still, it’s unforgivable for Man Utd, who lead our five-year net spend table, to even loosely be considered for relegation and be on a par with newly-promoted Sunderland, regardless of how well they have settled back into the Premier League, and it should leave INEOS with no option but to sack Amorim.",

      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",

Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon. And now it’s standing room only.",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening six games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",

      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",

It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",

      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Really not that hard to imagine this all coming to a sorry end awful fast.",
      "The home defeat to Sunderland leaves Postecoglou winless in September, but he always wins something in his second month. Mate.",

      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City.

      "READ: Five reasons why Ratcliffe is right to pick Southgate as next Man Utd manager",
      "Man Utd reportedly targeted Southgate before appointing Amorim as he is understood to have a strong relationship with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, though he was keen to take a break from management after his long spell as England boss.",
      "Now, Southgate has had a break and is reportedly back on Man Utd’s radar, though a report from The Mirror claims his current ‘stance’ is that ‘he would reject an approach from Manchester United if Amorim is sacked’.",
      "‘It’s understood that Southgate is NOT in any rush to return to football. However, he is keeping his options open – both within the game and outside.",
      "‘He’s been seen at numerous matches, as well as other sporting events, in recent months, and remains close with a number of his former FA colleagues. However, Southgate is also close friends with Dan Ashworth, who had a long term plan to appoint Southgate when he worked at United.’",
      "Former Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster, meanwhile, has explained why he thinks Iraola “is the one” to replace Amorim amid one concern with Southgate.",
      "“Iraola is the one for me,” Foster said on his Cycling GK podcast.",
      "“To lose half your squad, half your starting line-up, and then still be just as impressive, for me, that means you’re a proper coach.",
      "But if they’re trying to get Iraola or Glasner then it’s going to cost an awful lot of money.”",
      "On Southgate, he added: “I just think with Gareth Southgate, it’s so different to what they’ve ever done and what they’re doing isn’t working.”",

      "For people of a certain generation, Manchester United represents the all-conquering final boss of football.",
      "The ’90s and 2000s were dominated by Sir Alex Ferguson’s team and the idea of them falling away even after the Scot left felt impossible.",
      "And yet, the club’s latest embarrassment at the hands of Brentford, a team that finished third in League One in Ferguson’s final year, was not met with shock but apathy.",
      "More than a decade on since the manager left, Manchester United have transformed from title winners to laughing stock to simply another mediocre team.",
      "But how does one of the world’s biggest football clubs fall off so severely? Here are the five people most to blame for the mess of modern-day Manchester United.",
      "£1.25billion can get you a lot of things in the world. You could buy the most expensive apartment in New York four times over. You could have 17 of the most expensive Ferraris ever made sitting on your drive. You could even own 5 million pairs of Nike running shoes.",
      "Or you could become the very public face of one of the biggest sporting embarrassments on the planet.",
      "While the Glazers keep their distance, the self-confessed United fan (even though he tried to buy Chelsea) Ratcliffe has been a permanent presence at Old Trafford since his partial takeover, meaning after every embarrassing defeat, the camera cuts to him bearing an expression of a man confused as to why this is not as simple as running a pharmaceutical company.",
      "Ratcliffe beat somewhat mysterious opposition from Qatar to become a minority owner of United but in the near 600 days that he has been in charge of football operations, it has been one negative story after another.",
      "If on-field problems are to be expected, it is off-field that Ratcliffe has come in for most criticism. Almost as soon as his feet were under the desk, Ratcliffe and chief executive Omar Berrada set about cutting down the staff size. 250 employees were made redundant in the first round, a further 200 to come, with the club suggesting it will save between £8 and £10m – or around one seventh of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "With a staff size of around 1,100, maybe United did need to trim the fat a little bit but it is the manner in which Ratcliffe has gone about it that has most rubbed people up the wrong way. Since 1985, the club had given £40,000 to a charity set up to help former players who played in an era before the millions. Ratcliffe axed it.",
      "Ruthless yes, but when he sat down with an interview with Gary Neville, the former right-back asked why the club did not arrange a one-off dinner with current players to fund the expense and Ratcliffe, while looking like Neville had just discovered the cure for cancer, said they had not considered that as an idea.",
      "Then there are the on-pitch matters. Erik ten Hag was appointed pre-Ratcliffe but it was the INEOS boss who opted to keep him after an extensive review in the summer only to sack him a few months later.",
      "United paid a not insignificant fee to bring Dan Ashworth to the club, a man who had proven success as sporting director at Newcastle, but Ratcliffe sacked him five months into the job.",
      "Ratcliffe also led the way on the hiring of Ruben Amorim, a coach who looks so out of his depth and one who appears to be pining for the sack and a nice pay-out.",
      "The club have at least repaired their training ground and plans are in place for a revamped Old Trafford but somehow the atmosphere around the club feels worse than it did when the British billionaire first stepped in.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Man Utd flop ‘felt disrespected’ after ’40 days’ in exile after Amorim bomb squad decision\n👉 Man Utd technical team ‘bemused’ by Ratcliffe pick to replace Amorim at Old Trafford\n👉 Roy Keane, Manchester United manager? ‘Ferocious’ Red Devils legend ‘knows the standards’!",
      "In 100 years’ time and if we have not all been replaced by AI-powered cyborgs, Amorim will not even be mentioned in the history of Manchester United.",
      "His tenure, while being the main focus now, seems so fleeting, so inconsequential and so symptomatic of wider problems that it is hard to put too much blame on his shoulders.",
      "In many ways, it feels like Amorim is being blamed for the dining conditions on the Titanic. Yes, he has put the wrong cutlery out for the starters but that all seems rather inconsequential when there is a 12-foot hole in the front of the ship.",
      "Amorim has to be blamed for sticking so rigidly to a way of playing that, without some adaptations, simply cannot work in the highly physical Premier League and against some of the best tactical brains in the world. But Ratcliffe and co. should have known this before they hired him.",
      "Liverpool were the ones first on the lookout for a new manager when Jurgen Klopp retired but after looking at Amorim, their board decided he was too inflexible. Ratcliffe and co. deemed that perfect for a United squad with far worse players.",
      "Ed Woodward is not what some would call a ‘proper football man.’ Before he stepped through the doors at Old Trafford he worked as an investment banker and was working for JP Morgan before making the switch.",
      "Woodward was brought into the United fold during the Glazer takeover, acting as their advisor for the process. He was then added to a “financial planning” role but it was not until 2007 that his influence began to be felt.",
      "To give credit where credit’s due, Woodward was very good in his role of the leader of commercial operations at United. The lucrative deals he brought to the club (why wouldn’t United need an official agricultural vehicle partner?) created the platform that allows the club to spend hundreds of millions today despite being nowhere near the top of the table.",
      "But after the retirement of long-time CEO David Gill in 2013, Woodward began to play a bigger role in on-pitch matters. His first summer at the helm was characterised by an inability to bring in targets. Cesc Fabregas and Thiago Alcantara failed to join; the club even had to wait another year to sign Ander Herrera following reports that United officials met with Athletic Bilbao lawyers who were not actually anything to do with the Basque club.",
      "But more than the players the club didn’t sign, Woodward’s biggest mistakes were the ones they did. The club spent £89 million to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford, giving him a £200,000 a week contract for five years.",
      "As their league placement dropped, United attempted to stay in the market for the best players by offering them inflated wage packets. They gave the 19-year-old Anthony Martial £110,000. Bastian Schweinsteiger, deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern (which should have been a hint) was on £240,000. Luke Shaw, a full-back, was on £110,000.",
      "Worst of all, it gave United a reputation for being a club that will spend over the odds. In the first season that Woodward took over, United’s annual salary bill was around £100m. By the time he left in 2022, it was £230m.",
      "The summer after Woodward left, United signed Casemiro giving him £350,000 a week. To put that in context, Virgil van Dijk earns that for being the captain of a Premier League-winning squad. Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland are the only players in the league who earn more and all three of them signed their contracts this year, not back in 2022.",
      "United’s wage structure was blown out of the water by Woodward and trying to reel it back in while remaining competitive is proving to be an impossible task.",
      "Apportioning blame to a man who delivered 38 major trophies to a club may seem harsh but Ferguson was much more than a football manager.",
      "For more than two decades, Ferguson was Manchester United, for all the good and all the bad but his most egregious error came away from the pitch and was one born out of ego and selfishness.",
      "If football was the day job, Ferguson’s love was the racecourse. A huge horse racing fan, Ferguson became pals with John Magnier and JP McManus, the two richest men in Ireland and horse race owners. Ferguson convinced them to purchase shares in United, making them the second largest owners behind BSkyB.",
      "All was well until Ferguson was named as one of the owners of Rock of Gibraltar, a horse from the Coolmore stables owned by the Irish pair. The reasoning was good-natured enough: they wanted Ferguson to be the speaker at an event where rules dictated only owners could do so and they had a long-standing friendship with the Scot.",
      "But then, as it usually does, money turned things sour. The horse unexpectedly became rather good and was named European Horse of the Year in 2002. The friendship changed when Ferguson, as an owner, suggested he would be owed some of the stud rights (the right to breed with the horse in the hope of producing another champion) which are far more valuable than any race winnings.",
      "The Irish duo claimed Ferguson’s ownership was an honorary title and no such rights were due but the United boss did not back down and an enormous fallout occurred, eventually ending in a £2.5m out-of-court settlement for Ferguson after a long legal battle.",
      "But that money was only the second biggest effect of the affair which compelled both the Irish pair to sell their United shares to sever ties with Ferguson. And who was waiting in the wings? The Glazers.",
      "Could the Glazers have agreed a deal anyway? Maybe, but without the fallout with Ferguson, the Irish duo may not have parted with their shares and opened the door for the club to become a vehicle to line the Glazers’ pockets.",
      "Ferguson was already a rich man and had he not been greedy, the club he helped build may not have been in the mess it is now.",
      "For all the contributions of the mess of the modern-day United, the real genesis of the problem came 3,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "Malcolm Glazer was a wealthy man but his finances were nowhere near the level needed to take over the most successful club in England. Instead, he financed the takeover by putting the club itself as collateral and when he took over, the near debt-free United found itself with £604m on the books.",
      "But buying United was not a passion project for the American family, who also own the NFL team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was an investment. Football was well into the Premier League era and the finances were only going one way; taking control of the biggest club gave the Glazer family access to incredible wealth.",
      "They ‘earned’ this by taking dividends every year which the BBC calculated was around £1.2 billion in total. Instead of using that money to pay off the debt that they themselves put on the club, the Glazers pocketed it. The result is United have a debt now worth over £1 billion.",
      "The Glazers have also been very hands-off when it came to running the club. Ferguson and Gill papered over the cracks in the early years but when those two figureheads left, the Glazers kept a distance, using Woodward as their man to run things.",
      "They have also been incredibly stagnant when it comes to facilities. Old Trafford, once the envy of clubs across the country, is run down and susceptible to a leaking roof every time there is more than a slight downpour in Manchester. When favourite son Cristiano Ronaldo returned in 2022, he was dismayed to find the facilities were the same as when he had left.",
      "Two decades of Glazer rule has left the club a shell of what it once was. The badge on the door may still say Manchester United but underneath it, the club is entirely different from the early 2000s.",
      "The Glazers’ apathy has been the biggest killer of Manchester United, far more than any manager or executive has been. and yet, they still won’t sell because frankly why would you? Malcolm Glazer died in 2014 with his sons Avram, Joel and Bryan happy to pick up the ticket for the gravy train.",
      "In 2024, they sold 30% of their shares for a fee of £732m but their pockets have long been filled.",
      "Before the takeover was completed in 2005, the then-United board warned that taking on that level of debt would cause “a downward spiral in both team and financial performance.” In the 20 years that has followed, they have been proven right.",

      "A forgotten Manchester United exile with an ‘outstanding’ trait Ruben Amorim sorely needs has returned to first-team training after a shock U21 ‘request’.",
      "While Manchester United eventually found homes for most members of their summer bomb squad, a buyer or even loan suitor for Tyrell Malacia could not be sourced.",

      "Malacia had been training with the U21s since being frozen out but as Amorim pledged in July, he has been brought back into the first-team fold with the transfer window shut.",
      "Even during his exile Malacia earned rave reviews for his commitment.",
      "His ‘intensity’ was described as ‘off the charts’ and his ‘attitude’ regarded as ‘an example for everybody else’, according to Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail.",
      "It is also said that Malacia ‘requested to be allowed to play for the U21s’ during his time with them but that opportunity never transpired.",
      "Dutch outlet Voetbal International adds that while Malacia’s return to the fold was ‘against all odds’, Amorim ‘will give the left-back a serious chance to fight his way back into the team’.",
      "“We got to see him for the first time reintegrated back into the first team this morning. We got a glimpse of open training with Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "“Remember, this was a player who was training away from the group alongside the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. But Ruben Amorim was always very adamant that any player who didn’t get a move away from the club would be reintegrated into the first team and that is exactly what has happened with Tyrell Malacia.",
      "“He had a meeting with Amorim, as I understand it, this week. He has been training with the U21s for the last few weeks to get some fitness back amongst the group.",
      "“It’s been described to me as he’s had an outstanding attitude in training with the U21s, he’s been a great influence on that squad, and he has now back with the first team.",
      "“This is a player who’s had a really challenging few seasons, first of all through injury. But then also just not really being involved in the first-team picture. He last represented Manchester United on January 26 in the Premier League.",
      "“But this was always part of the plan. He was part of the Premier League squad that was submitted at the beginning of the season. He’s another option for Ruben Amorim to look at at that left wing-back position in a side that is conceding somewhat soft goals.",
      "“It might be a few weeks before he gets that match fitness back, but it was good from a fan perspective to see those pictures of Tyrell Malacia, backing up what Ruben Amorim had to say in the summer.”",

      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his gang of Manchester United revolutionaries are looking at alternative options to Erik ten Hag, who seems increasingly unlikely to last beyond the summer’ we wrote in May 2024 when we first put forward some reasons why Gareth Southgate would *actually* be good for United.",
      "At that stage links to the England manager provoked head-shaking en masse from Red Devils fans, who refused to even consider the appointment of a man who unilaterally prevented the actual Golden Generation from winning three major tournaments on the bounce over, say, a very charming man from Portugal. What they needed was a clear philosophy and system, not good will and vibes, FFS.",
      "There was more than a whiff of rage-bating in our last Southgate to United rationale, but the mess that’s been Ruben Amorim’s Old Trafford tenure makes Ratcliffe sticking him on the shortlist of possible replacements less ‘bemusing’ than ever.",
      "",
      "Togetherness\nPut your cynicism aside for a second, difficult though it is not to imagine Southgate as a travelling team-building consultant stood in front of half-asleep employees with this one word on a whiteboard behind him: “What does togetherness mean to you?”",
      "Because the Manchester United players could really do with a week of inset days to hammer home what it means to pull in the same direction and support each other.",
      "The dressing-room remains as leaky as a discount diaper and Ratcliffe should consider splashing out on name-brand nappies to failsafe against the collective sh*tting of the bed from United players at the first sign of strife.",
      "Southgate may not be the greatest tactician, but there can be no doubting his ability to improve the ethos and dynamics of a dressing-room, having picked England up off the floor after they were thunder-clapped out of Euro 2016 and leading them to a place where each and every player enjoyed wearing the shirt which used to weigh heavy to the point of paralysis.",
      "It’s been a long time since Manchester United players looked as though they were enjoying their football as much as the England stars did under the former Middlesbrough boss, with Ten Hag and Ruben Amorim’s teams as burdened as the pre-Southgate Three Lions.",
      "",
      "Dan Ashworth was so right\nGareth Southgate consistently and vehemently praised the impact of Dan Ashworth on England in their time working for the FA together, crediting the 159-day United sporting director for the country’s success at youth level, which translated to the significant improvement of the senior team under Southgate’s watch. And the respect is mutual.",
      "“Gareth is an exceptional leader,” Ashworth said ahead of the 2018 World Cup, just before he upped sticks for Brighton. “The environment that has been created is down to him. He’s got a really good understanding of getting the best out of the players and staff. So what’s ended up happening is that Gareth has brought together a way of working for the players and the staff that means it is one big group of people. He has to take the credit.”",
      "We’re not about to suggest that United should follow the advice of a man they a) sacked after five months, and b) voted in favour of keeping Ten Hag after the 2023/2024 season, but he was so right about the ‘mass disruption’ hiring Amorim and his very specific style wholly unsuited to the United squad would cause that you’ve got to wonder if he might have been just as spot on with Southgate being the best bet to help them crawl out of the hole they continue to dig for themselves.",
      "",
      "Philosophy schmilosophy\nWho better to replace a man roundly criticised for his stubborn insistence on a failing system and philosophy than a man who never really had either?",
      "Southgate’s critics claimed he failed to get the best out of one the greatest crops of attacking English talent in history and we’ll get a better sense as to whether that’s fair or not when we see what Thomas Tuchel’s Three Lions produce at the 2026 World Cup. We would be surprised if they do any better.",
      "He got them to two major tournament finals, largely by – and we know this sounds mad – looking at the players he had available to him and coming up with a formation to get the best out of those players.",
      "Now, we know that didn’t always work and there were square pegs in round holes at times. But it’s not as though there was some sort of naturalisation window where he could bring in ‘his players’ from other nations. He had to make do with what he was given and we’re guessing that will be a very attractive quality in a new Manchester United manager for Ratcliffe and the Ineos bosses.",
      "He won’t do anything revolutionary. He’s not about to rip up Premier League playbooks. Four at the back. Two sitting midfielders behind Bruno Fernandes in the No.10. Couple of wingers. Striker. Sorted. And Manchester United will be so much better for it.",
      "",
      "Homegrown focus\nIt was claimed at the start of his tenure that Sir Jim was keen on signing homegrown talent as part of his changes to the recruitment model at United. He ‘wanted to reinforce a domestic flavour’, which sounds suspiciously Brexit-y, but is likely – just as deplorably – to be connected with a desire for more Manchester United DNA.",
      "We don’t quite know what’s happened since as literally none of Ratcliffe’s £430m-odd outlay has been spent on homegrown players, while Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford have all p*ssed off and Kobbie Mainoo hasn’t yet but is certainly p*ssed. In fact, all evidence points to Ratcliffe hating British footballers. Might make that our headline.",
      "There’s bound to be a patriotic shift under Southgate, who could prove to be quite the carrot for new signings of the correct heritage, but would also surely put Mainoo straight back into the starting lineup, as he should be anyway, having picked him for Euro 2024 after half a season of senior football, before selecting him (admittedly after some Conor Gallagher, Trent Alexander-Arnold nonsense) as Declan Rice’s midfield partner.",
      "We know he’s a big fan of Mason Mount and it’s hard to see a manger getting less out of him than either Ten Hag or Amorim. And while there might be a slight concern as to just how enduring his love is for Harry Maguire and whether that might see him start each and every game, if Matthijs de Ligt plays as he did against Brentford then that is absolutely what should be happening.",
      "",
      "The press conference charisma\nIt was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and Ineos plumping for him as their manager, and we can’t think of anything other than the Portuguese manager’s charm that’s keeping him in the job right now. If anything, he’s honest to a fault, but that makes him a very difficult man to dislike, and there’s no doubting his ability to hold a room.",
      "Southgate is also excellent in a press conference. Not in the same smiley, jovial, self-deprecating way, but when he speaks, you listen and the United bosses can rest assured that they’re in the safe hands of a company man should they appoint him.",
      "There will be plenty of Red Devils fans who couldn’t give two shiny sh*ts about how good their leader is with the media, but like it or not, the way in which a manager is perceived, spoken and written about makes a significant difference to the time they’re given to implement ideas on the pitch and, more crucially, is a fairly good indication as to how they’re dealing with the players. Southgate could soothe the Old Trafford disorder.",
      "Jude Bellingham has been both AXED and DROPPED by England after Thomas Tuchel REFUSED an obvious request. Gareth Southgate has some shock Man Utd demands.",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Gareth Southgate has decided his ‘stance’ on replacing Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Members of the Man Utd technical team are reportedly ‘bemused’ by one of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s picks to be their next manager, according to reports.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate is “definitely” someone that Man Utd are “looking at” to replace Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Surely there is nobody – not even Ruben Amorim – who thinks that Ruben Amorim should not be sacked by Manchester United."

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances.",

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Friday 3 October 2025 12:35, UK",
      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and backs Sunderland to beat Manchester United.",
      "Bournemouth are a team with a clear identity, built on a relentless, coordinated high press and quick transitions - a style that causes havoc against sides who insist on trying to pass their way up the pitch.",
      "Marco Silva's side are nothing if not committed to possession football. They're fourth in the league for passes made in their own half this season, yet they also rank second for high turnovers conceded which lead to shots (8) - meaning they are vulnerable when coming under pressure in their own half. That's a dangerous mix. The Andoni Iraola press will be too hot for Fulham to handle, so back a home win at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you're looking to jump on a savvy angle this weekend, make sure you're on Tottenham's set-piece threat. Since Thomas Frank took the reins, Spurs have added a whole new weapon to their attacking output: their massive threat from dead balls. And against this Leeds side that wobbles like jelly when defending set-pieces, the numbers point to backing Spurs to cause Leeds lots of problems.",
      "Leeds are shipping 1.7 shots per game from set-pieces and have already allowed four goals conceded via that method, including last weekend's last equaliser for Bournemouth.",
      "Frank's teams make clever blocks, delayed runs, decoy movements, and that causes chaos in the six-yard box. Micky van de Ven has already scored three goals this season as the Dutchman has quietly become a monster at these attacking set-pieces. He is 33/1 with Sky Bet to score first.",
      "Eberechi Eze is not your typical Arsenal midfielder. He doesn't deal in safe passes, low-risk link play or rehearsed rotations. He thrives on chaos. Unpredictability is in his blood and in an Arsenal side that, at times last season, could feel a little too methodical in the final third from open play, Eze's spontaneity and eye for something different is the perfect curveball that opposition players must warn against.",
      "With the technical security around him, he's going to get more touches in dangerous areas, more one-on-one situations and this should lead to an increase in his shots on target numbers than what the algorithms are predicting. He's recorded two shots on target in both of his last two starts at Newcastle and Port Vale which points towards the 6/4 on him clearing that line again with Sky Bet being a slice of value.",
      "Those backing Manchester United at 1/2 with Sky Bet are being lured in by their expected goals for data. It's the best in the Premier League (12.21) - but that is as a misleading statistic as you're likely to find when it comes to analysing expected goals.",
      "The moment you start judging a team's attacking quality solely by their xG, you're dancing on a tactical tightrope without a safety net when it comes to making betting decisions.",
      "United's expected goals data is so healthy as the game-state has forced them to chase games after falling behind in matches, owing to their horrendous defensive process, which is the second worst in the Premier League according to expected goals against (9.35).",
      "From six Premier League games, they have spent 244 minutes trailing this season - that is why those xG figures appear so healthy.",
      "A huge chunk of that attacking data and chance creation has come when the game was out of their reach. If a team only looks dangerous when it's losing, how dangerous is it, really? That's a red flag.",
      "And, despite over a decade of chaos, churn and comedy defending, it's still a club that draws in public money like few others in the betting markets, which in turn keeps their price shorter than it should be.",
      "Sunderland to avoid defeat on the double chance at a whopping 13/8 with Sky Bet it is then.",
      "The markets have chalked up over 2.5 goals as a short-priced favourite at 1/2 with Sky Bet - as they often do in the Premier League - but peel back the layers and there's plenty of evidence to suggest a low-scoring, tight encounter is the smarter play. Under 2.5 goals is around 6/4 with Sky Bet. And that's value.",
      "Arne Slot is a pragmatic, flexible coach who wants control, not the chaotic defending we've seen at times from Liverpool this season.",
      "Slot will be aware of the noise heading into an international break about his side and this is why pure focus will be on defensive solidity, discipline and trying to control the game through possession at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Plus, still without Cole Palmer, Chelsea look predictable and blunt.",
      "I'm expecting a slow burner.",
      "Burnley's new signing, Florentino, is shaping up as a fantastic bet in the fouls committed markets, which are often overlooked as a mainstream betting medium but are laced with value especially for new signings adapting to the Premier League's physical demands.",
      "The Premier League is fast, physical and ruthless and Florentino's style screams dynamic enforcer on what we've seen from him in his two starts so far. He's a midfielder who plays with aggression and intensity, breaking up play and never shying away from a physical duel.",
      "The former Benfica man committed 1.79 fouls per 90 last season, including making at least one foul in his last 19 starts. He's already made three in two starts for Burnley and such is Villa's foul-drawing strength in central areas, that kind of average is likely to be repeated at Villa Park. The Evens for two or more Florentino fouls looks a solid play.",
      "Crystal Palace have the team to do something really special this season in the Premier League.",
      "But they won't.",
      "As to remain consistent in the Premier League will be almost impossible for them to achieve due to their European commitments.",
      "A first taste of European football in their modern era is something fans and Oliver Glasner will take very seriously. And rightly so. Selhurst Park under the lights for a knockout game will be mega. But as romantic as that sounds, it's also going to bring with it a Premier League hangover.",
      "Clubs of Palace's stature and budget often struggle to handle the double life of domestic and European football. Clubs outside the big six who get Europe have an average drop of 6.3 league positions the following season since 2015. We've seen it with Brighton, West Ham and Leicester over the years. It's going to happen to Palace, so the home win at 6/4 with Sky Bet looks a wise investment on Everton following Palace's midweek trip to Poland.",
      "In a Newcastle midfield built to fight, Sandro Tonali glides and creates the magic. While Bruno Guimaraes orchestrates and Joelinton bullies, Tonali is the biggest goal threat. Everything he does is filled with intent. He doesn't just want to circulate possession. He wants to influence.",
      "When Newcastle play at home, Eddie Howe unleashes a more expansive, front-foot midfield. Tonali becomes the spare man in transitions, the third runner in attacks and has become a goal threat. He's scored five times in his last 17 starts at St James' Park and has averaged a healthy 1.62 shots per 90 with hitting two or more shots in seven of his last 11 home starts.",
      "He's not being priced like a consistent goalscoring threat yet. And that's where the edge is at 11/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Brighton at odds-on to beat Wolves? It just doesn't sit right. The price doesn't match the flakiness and inconsistencies involved with Fabian Hurzeler's team.",
      "Yes, Brighton are still getting results. But scratch beneath the surface with both the eye test and the underlying metrics and this is a team that isn't functioning anywhere near the levels the market seems to think they are.",
      "Brighton's defensive numbers are the biggest worry. They've conceded an average of 1.6 expected goals per game over the last 13 Premier League - that's the worst per 90 figure of any ever-present team during that period.",
      "Their pressing structure, once so cohesive and suffocating, is now easier to play through - and their high-risk, high-reward build-up play is not seeing the returns it once did. They have kept just one clean sheet in their last 18 Premier League games, too.",
      "Wolves are of course no juggernaut, but they're tactically disciplined, aggressive in duels and more than capable of spoiling Brighton's rhythm in midfield.",
      "The market is pricing up Brighton on vibes rather than reality. Back Wolves on the draw no bet at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "There are few greater joys in the betting game than sniffing out value in the foul markets. It's the new frontier. Goalscorer markets are overcooked. Booking points can be a lottery. Outright markets can be settled on fine margins. But fouls? That's where the true edge lives.",
      "The standout match-up for fouls this weekend is Michael Kayode vs Jeremy Doku. Such is Doku's form right now, all I can say to Kayode is: good luck, son.",
      "Kayode is as raw as they come but very aggressive with his defending, meaning he's foul-prone when isolated.",
      "Douk doesn't just beat defenders, he destroys them. He's drawn 13 fouls in his last five starts and is completing nearly five dribbles completed per game. Kayode is 6/4 to make two or more fouls with Sky Bet. That's a lovely angle to attack.",

      "Tuesday 30 September 2025 17:00, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb says it was \"good use of VAR\" to overturn Arsenal's 'penalty' at Newcastle and explains Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres was \"quite different\" to the foul committed by Chelsea's Robert Sanchez that saw him sent off a week prior.",
      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "Monday 29 September 2025 06:13, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a scathing assessment of the current state of Ruben Amorim's Manchester United, declaring it \"ridiculous\" that Mason Mount has been playing wing-back.",
      "Neville has admitted he is worried about United as he raised serious doubts about the club's direction under Amorim.",
      "United suffered a third defeat in six Premier League games this season when they were beaten 3-1 at Brentford on Saturday, with Amorim's side failing to build on the previous week's win over Chelsea. United have still not back-to-back Premier League games under the head coach.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" he said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"The performance that we saw and the result at Brentford means that you feel the Chelsea game was skewed by the sending off. You start to look at the Chelsea win less positively. That's just football.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry.",
      "\"I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.",
      "\"There was something that happened in that game that I mentioned on my podcast two or three weeks ago that I said we couldn't see again. I said that Mason Mount ended up at left wing-back.",
      "\"There's sticking to your plan and then there's your coach that's got an idea and making sure that he delivers that idea and not flip flopping with his idea with players, which can sometimes undermine what you're trying to achieve.",
      "\"But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back - and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes to the game - it starts to look awful.\"",
      "He added: \"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back. I'm sorry, it just can't happen. I can't watch Mason Mount play left wing-back in a football team.",
      "\"I struggled at times to watch him in his natural position, but actually putting him out there on the left wing, is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "United boss Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job.",
      "\"Amorim has had a pre-season,\" Neville said. \"He's had a week now in between each of his games because Manchester United aren't in Europe. Yet the performances are as poor as ever.",
      "\"The results are catastrophic, really, in Manchester United terms. The money that's been spent has been big and there are some things that I'm seeing that are a massive worry, and some things that can't happen.",
      "\"So I am very concerned, I really am, because the manager's obviously a good coach. He's had a great record in Portugal but it's not clicking at all.",
      "\"You've got to see what happens next Saturday against Sunderland - if that game goes against Manchester United, you're going to start seeing very big questions being asked of the ownership, big questions.",
      "\"They brought a young manager in. He's played a completely different system. They've invested in a completely different system. If they were to be 14th, 15th or 16th in October, it's not a one-off. It becomes what you are.",
      "\"It becomes a pattern and the manager comes under huge pressure. We've seen what's happened with Graham Potter in the last few days. That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away and it's going to build in this next week or so.",
      "\"A victory is needed more than ever at Old Trafford on Saturday against Sunderland.\"",
