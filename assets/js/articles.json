      "Alexis Mac Allister faces the possibility of returning to Liverpool later than expected ahead of next week's clash with Manchester United. This comes as Argentina's fixture against Puerto Rico appears set to be postponed by a day.",
      "World champions Argentina were scheduled to face Puerto Rico on Monday, October 13 at Chicago's Soldier Field Stadium.",
      "Yet reports have surfaced suggesting the match will be delayed by 24 hours and relocated to Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the home ground of Inter Miami sensation and Argentina skipper Lionel Messi.",
      "This means Reds midfielder Mac Allister may be returning to Merseyside later than originally expected, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "The development gives the playmaker reduced preparation time for United's visit on Sunday, October 19 as Arne Slot seeks to halt a sequence of three consecutive losses.",
      "Chicago Park District spokesman Luca Serra told The Associated Press on Wednesday (September 17) that the Puerto Rico encounter would not take place in Chicago.",
      "\"Yes, confirming that the Argentina against Puerto Rico match has been cancelled in Chicago\", Serra stated. \"The promoter made the decision this morning due to low ticket sales.\"",
      "No official announcement has been issued by the promoter.",
      "An Argentine Football Association official earlier confirmed the switch to the AP, citing the circumstances in Chicago, where United States President Donald Trump has deployed the National Guard to suppress demonstrations against the immigration crackdown. An official, who wished to remain anonymous as the relocation had not been publicly announced, shared this information.",
      "Over 1,000 immigrants have been apprehended since an immigration crackdown kicked off last month in the Chicago area.",
      "The Trump administration pledged to deploy National Guard troops in its mission to ramp up deportations.",
      "Argentina is set to face Venezuela in another friendly match on Friday at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium.",

      "Mac Allister, meanwhile, has had a challenging start to the season.",
      "Despite being one of the stars of last season's title win, the 26-year-old has grappled with his fitness. Although he has started six out of Liverpool's seven Premier League matches so far this season, he hasn't managed to complete any of them.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has no plans to leave Manchester United for Saudi Arabia, despite tempting offers from Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad last summer. The United captain is committed to remaining a pivotal part of Ruben Amorim's rebuilding project at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite recent rumours suggesting the 31-year-old may seek a move away from United after next year's World Cup, insiders close to Fernandes have told the BBC that this isn't the case. Fernandes' current contract runs until 2027, with an option to extend for another year.",
      "However, that's a tall order at the moment. Amorim has found it tough to change United's fortunes since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November, managing only a 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season.",
      "Currently, United are sitting 10th in the league table with three wins, three losses and a draw from their first seven matches. Add to that a humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to League Two's Grimsby Town in August, and it's easy to see why Fernandes has been linked with a move away from the north west.",
      "Yet Fernandes, now established as one of Amorim's key figures and a regular starter under the manager, might recognise that a move away may not necessarily improve his situation.",
      "It comes as Turki Al-Sheikh has posted a cryptic message regarding the ownership future of Manchester United.",
      "The Glazer Family currently possess the authority to sell their complete shareholding in the club through the activation of 'drag along' rights, which stop majority owners from being held hostage by minority stakeholders.",
      "While the Glazers hold the capability to compel Sir Jim Ratcliffe to offload his stake, there had been minimal talk of such a scenario materialising until Wednesday evening.",
      "In an almost unexpected post on X, Saudi businessman Al-Sheikh suggested that the club might soon undergo a change of ownership.",
      "He posted: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "The message arrived merely hours after a rare interview with Ratcliffe was made public, in which, the Ineos chief gave no suggestion that he was considering relinquishing control of the club.",

      "Djibril Cisse has angrily fired back at Wayne Rooney over claims his Queen's Park Rangers side intentionally helped Manchester City win their first Premier League title.",
      "QPR were City's opponents on the final day of the 2011/12 season, when they famously came from behind to win in stoppage time and pip Manchester United to the title.",
      "Rooney and Co. had done their job by beating Sunderland at the Stadium of Light and were a ready for a party in the North East, with City trailing QPR going into the final stages. But Edin Dzeko's late equaliser laid the foundations for Sergio Aguero's late strike - arguably the most iconic goal in Premier League history.",
      "QPR went into the final day of the season with their own top-flight status under threat, but knew they would be safe before the final whistle was blown. That has led to scepticism, voiced by Rooney, that the Hoops were happy to let their hosts stage their miraculous comeback.",
      "United's record goalscorer also questioned the fact that Cisse, who spent time with Liverpool earlier in his career, was seen 'celebrating' with City players after the final whistle.",
      "But Cisse has now moved to put the record straight, insisting Rooney's comments were disrespectful. In an interview with FourFourTwo, the French striker said: \"I'm not going to take this accusation any longer. I was celebrating with Samir Nasri.",
      "\"I didn't celebrate with Mario Balotelli, Sergio Aguero or anybody else. I celebrated with my brother, Samir, who had been a friend of mine for 15 years.",
      "\"I was happy for my friend and also that we managed to stay up. I don't care about Man City. My friend finally won the Premier League after many years in England and I was happy for him and also for me. That's all.\"",
      "Cisse opened the scoring for QPR during that game, also questioned why his side would have fought so hard to lead the game, if their plan was to let City win anyway.",
      "He added: \"What Rooney said isn't cool. He took out his frustrations on me. It's not my fault.",
      "\"If we had wanted Man City to win the league, would it not have been a little risky to have waited until the very last minute to let them score?",
      "\"We could have let them win 4–0 or 5–0 and gone home. But we played a strong team, the manager wanted to win that game. It wasn’t our reserve team.\"",
      "Rooney reignited the debate earlier this year, when he shared his feelings during an episode of the Overlap Fan Debate. Asked about that day, he said: \"Obviously that was a tough one that...But again didn't Paddy Kenny turn the ball in for two goals? QPR knew they were safe and City get it to 2-2, then they just boot the ball back to them.",
      "\"They had Cisse on the pitch, Joey Barton got sent off for acting stupid. Who else was it? Shaun Wright-Phillips and Nedum Onuoha diving about.\"",
      "However much that afternoon still gnaws at Rooney, United did use it as motivation to win the Premier League title for the 13th and final time under Sir Alex Ferguson the following season.",

The 27-year-old made the switch to Catalonia on a season-long loan deal in July following Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim's decision that he had no future in his plans.",
      "The Catalan giants possess the option to make Rashford's move permanent for £30million in 2026. Following his impressive displays since the September international break, Barcelona are said to be eager to land the England international, though they're hoping to negotiate a reduced fee of approximately £26m.",
      "Rashford has three years remaining on his existing Old Trafford contract, which he penned in July 2023 after netting a career-high 30 goals for United during the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Throughout his career, Rashford has mainly operated as a left-winger, though he's occasionally been deployed on the opposite flank and up front.",
      "During a conversation with Gary Neville nearly two years ago on The Overlap's YouTube channel, Rashford was questioned about whether the right side represented his most challenging position across the front three. \"Yeah, definitely,\" he responded.",
      "\"It's just the angles of the runs you make in behind – because most of my game is running in behind and trying to stretch defences and give space to some of the other players.",
      "\"But the angles of the runs sometimes, I feel like I run too far inside, and then I'm running backwards the other way to try and get the ball.",
      "\"Whereas on the left, it's just natural to do it, it feels more normal.\"",
      "Barcelona boss Flick is reportedly considering a new role for Marcus Rashford when the La Liga champions return from the international break, as he 'sees something different' for the attacking line following two consecutive losses to Paris Saint Germain and Sevilla.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, the Manchester United academy graduate could be utilised as a No.9 under Flick's management, with Raphinha taking up position on the left wing and Lamine Yamal on the right.",
      "The report suggests that this attacking line-up could be seen in Barca's next match - a home game against Catalan rivals Girona on Saturday, October 18. Barcelona will then welcome Olympiacos to their home ground four days later for a Champions League clash.",

      "Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have nailed their colours to the mast over who should step in should Manchester United run out of patience with Ruben Amorim. The head coach has come under intense pressure this season following a torrid start to the campaign, which has seen a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby and poor league form.",
      "There was speculation that Amorim could be sacked if he failed to beat Sunderland on Saturday, but a 2-0 win over the Black Cats has eased the pressure somewhat. Minority owner Sir Jim Radcliffe has insisted he will give Amorim time, although it is hard to see United sticking with the Portuguese coach if they become mired in the bottom half of the table, as they were last season, especially having spent more than £200million on new signings in the summer.",
      "If United do pull the trigger, United legends Neville, Scholes and Keane have made it clear who they would like at the helm. Both Neville and Keane would go for long-serving Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane spoke of his admiration for the fiery Argentine, who has led Atletico to the La Liga title and Champions League finals.",
      "The Irishman said: “I’ve said it for years, I’d like Atletico Madrid’s Simeone to go in there. I’d like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, who left Atletico to join the Gunners as sporting director].",
      "“I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He'd rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I'd just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "“People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn't like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",
      "However, Keane isn’t pushing for Amorim to be sacked just yet. He joked: “I’d still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week.” Neville agreed with Keane, adding: “I think I’d go with that. I’d go with Simeone.”",
      "However, Scholes went for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, although he had reservations about his long-time assistant, Jason Tindall, joining him. He said: “I’m not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.”",
      "However, Amorim looks set to be given more time, judging by Ratcliffe’s recent comments on The Times’ The Business podcast. He said: “He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That’s where I would be.",
      "“The press, sometimes I don’t understand. They want overnight success. They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”",

Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "The Glazers have treated Manchester United like a cash-cow. For two decades, the Floridian billionaires, who own a 48.9 percent stake in the club, have been making hay while the sun shines.",
      "They have done so having loaded the club up to its eyeballs with debt. Since their 2005 takeover, around £1.2billion has been spent on debt interest, repayments, dividends and fees to the Glazers. They have sat back and milked a club they view as a business, more than a footballing institution for as much as they possibly could.",
      "Despite not winning the Champions League since 2008 or the Premier League title since 2013, United continue to boast record revenues. Never mind losses of £33m, the latest figures in June showed United generated revenues of almost £670m. And this is despite the team not even being in the Champions League.",
      "They are largely reviled by United fans. But they don't care. And when you've got the cash coming in like they have, who would want to give up such a good thing?",
      "Certainly, not the Glazers.",

      "A billionaire worth in excess of £2billion, he's the head of the sporting division of the Saudi Arabian government. And the man masterminding a sportwashing campaign aimed at improving his nation's atrocious reputation when it comes to human rights, the treatment of women and political controversies.",
      "The Saudis have the keys to the kingdom when it comes to LIV Golf, while Formula One has succumbed to the Middle East kingdom's vast wealth too. So has snooker, with darts poised to follow. In 2034, the World Cup heads there too.",
      "Publicly, Al-Sheikh - better known as Turki - has his claws into boxing. You'll have seen him calling up Eddie Hearn and making the Matchroom Boxing supremo jump into action whenever he fancied in the Hearn's Netflix documentary. Turki's £1bn collaboration with DAZN, via Matchroom, has seen the biggest fights head to Saudi.",
      "Now speculation is mounting that he wants a stake in United.",
      "For starters, INEOS, who own a 27.7 per cent share of United, are not in the conversation. Sir Jim Ratcliffe remains committed to the English giants, and has no interest in selling what he spent a lifetime striving to get his hands on.",
      "On the other hand however, the Glazers would be willing to sit round a table if the price was right.",
      "Yet, it would stretch even Turki's cavernous pockets. United's current value is around £2billion, but the Glazers would want a 'premium' based on potential future values. They've seen what Chelsea went for a few years back, not to mention the valuation of US sports teams, most notably those in NFL.",
      "United are refusing to comment, and claim to have no knowledge of any negotiations taking place with the Saudis. But the Glazers could be plotting a sale in secret back in the United States. Who knows?",
      "But there is one thing that we do now. One thing that remains as true as it has always been: Money talks.",
      "And nowhere is that more true, nowhere does money speak louder, than in football.",

      "However, a 2-0 victory over Sunderland alleviated some of the immediate concerns, albeit plenty more is expected of him. Among the bookmakers, Glasner is one of the names mentioned to potentially replace Amorim.",
      "The Austrian guided Palace to the FA Cup last season, and if not for a UEFA ruling, the Eagles would be playing in the Europa League this season. Up until last weekend, Palace were the only remaining unbeaten side in the division, but defeat to Everton scuppered that.",
      "This week, Glasner was awarded the Coach of the Year award at Austria’s Sporthilfe Gala for his achievements at Palace. After receiving the award, the 51-year-old was coy about being linked to other jobs, including United, making it clear that he is blocking out the noise and focusing on Palace for the time being.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I’m successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he said when asked about the links. \"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",
      "\"It’s simply better when you don’t lose 19 games than when you don’t win 19. Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier.",

      "Glasner's response is indicative of the man that he is, even though his position at Palace is up in the air entirely. The manager's contract runs out at the end of this season, and his star midfielder, Adam Wharton, suggested he is waiting to see if his head coach will extend his deal.",
      "Should Glasner become a free agent, there is no suggestion that United would be on the lookout for a replacement for Amorim. Speaking on The Business Podcast this week, Ratcliffe stated that he wished to give Amorim three years to prove himself at the club.",
      "Next month will mark one year since Amorim started work at Old Trafford following the sacking of Erik ten Hag at the end of October. During that time, the Portuguese head coach has led United to the Europa League final, but this came at the cost of finishing 16th in the Premier League.",

He touched down in Barcelona in July on a 12-month loan arrangement, though this deal features an option to purchase the 27-year-old.",
      "Rashford has been relishing his stint in Spain, notching three goals and five assists thus far this campaign. Should Barcelona desire to make his switch permanent, it would set them back a reported £26million and if United seek to recoup a fee for the forward, the Catalan club's economic figures spell encouraging news.",

      "Speculation is mounting that Saudi billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh is launching a takeover bid for United - despite what United say. But Turki would have to start the bidding at around £5.2billion, to stand a realistic chance of persuading the Glazers to sell up.",
      "The Floridian businessmen took control of United two decades ago in a £790m deal. United's current value stands at £2b. But the Glazers would demand a huge premium, which reflects a possible increase in the value of United in the future.",
      "This would take into account how much United might be worth if the club completes plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium.",
      "And one option open to the Glazers is to sell part of their 48.9 per cent stake in United, in return for some significant investment from Saudi to help fund the building of the new stadium.",
      "United bosses announced plans in March to build a 100,000-seater stadium costing around £2billion, that would regenerate the surrounding area and be one of the best on the planet.",
      "But it's understood United are nowhere near securing the finance required for the ambitious project. The Glazers rejected a takeover by Sheikh Jassim Al-Thani's Qatari consortium in 2024, selling 27.7 per cent of the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS empire instead.",
      "Ratcliffe paid £1.25billion and was allowed to take charge of football operations at Old Trafford. United announced record revenues of almost £670m in June, but have been forced to make significant staff redundancies and remain desperate for a cash injection.",
      "United have refused to comment on a possible deal with the Suadis, while Ratcliffe insists he remains fully committed to the club.",

      "Antony has revealed that he was courted by numerous clubs, including Bayern Munich, before his departure from Manchester United. The 25-year-old was part of the so-called 'bomb squad' at United, a group of players deemed surplus to requirements and put up for sale last summer.",
      "The others were Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia. Antony eventually signed with Spanish side Real Betis, where he had enjoyed a successful loan spell in the second half of last season. However, Antony's decision wasn't straightforward.",
      "He claims he received interest from Bayern, Benfica, Fenerbahçe, RB Salzburg, and Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr, as he considered his options away from Old Trafford. Antony's time at United was a letdown following his £85million transfer from Ajax in 2022, with the club taking a loss of more than £60m when he made his permanent move to Betis.",
      "Despite that, if Antony's claims are accurate, they highlight the untapped potential that many clubs still believe he possesses. Speaking to Brazilian media, he said: \"Bayern also approached me, but I had practically everything agreed with Betis.",
      "\"I was torn, but I was already 95 per cent committed to Betis. The financial aspect is important, but my happiness... I know how happy my son, my daughter and my wife are in Seville.\"",
      "In addition, Antony has alleged that he was shown a lack of respect by certain individuals at United. In a recent interview with ESPN Brasil, he said: \"I'm not the kind of guy who gets involved in controversies, who names people. In fact, I won't mention anyone's name here.",
      "\"But I think there was a bit of a lack of respect there, even a bit of rudeness too, with no one giving you a 'good morning', a 'good afternoon'. Not even that.",
      "\"But, anyway, that's in the past, I won't give much importance to these things. Now I'm here, at Betis, I'm living here, that's the most important thing for me.\"",
      "Nevertheless, he acknowledged his role in the expensive transfer to United failing to deliver results. He said: \"I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance.",
      "\"I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing. I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things; going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",

      "Howe has proved himself to be a top manager since arriving at St James' Park in 2021. He took over when the Magpies were in the relegation zone and has since made them a Champions League outfit and delivered a trophy in the form of the Carabao Cup.",
      "He's been aided by the club's huge wealth, but has still been credited with improving several players, many of whom he inherited. That has seen Howe's stock rise and he's enjoyed a particularly strong record against the Red Devils.",
      "Last term he secured a double over Amorim. Beating him 2-0 at Old Trafford in what was an utterly dominant showing before replicating that with a commanding 4-1 win back in Newcastle - and Scholes thinks he'd be an ideal manager for the Red Devils.",
      "The former player told The Overlap when quizzed on his choice: “Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe. I’m not sure about his mate [assistant, Jason Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Despite that wish Howe himself has addressed speculation linking him with other jobs - insisting \"I'm all in\" at Newcastle. He's continually been backed by the club's hierarchy and has delivered on that faith, which he wants to continue doing.",
      "Howe told Chronicle Live: \"I'm all in (at Newcastle). My commitment here is 100% here and always has been. My family is still here, and we are fighting every day to make a success of what we are doing. The season ahead could be a wonderful thing, and that is what we are trying to focus on, trying to make a success of the games we have coming up.\"",

      "On the one hand, you have to admire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s loyalty. On the other, you have to question his blind faith for giving Ruben Amorim three years to turn things around at Manchester United.",
      "But, honestly, what was far more baffling was the comparison about how long it took Sir Alex Ferguson and, even more so, Mikel Arteta to turn things around.",
      "Fergie arguably took five years to get things right at Old Trafford and turn the club into the best in England and one of the most successful in world football. But, come on, that was the 1980s into the 1990s. Trying to compare those times with now, is ridiculous. We live in a very different era. Long before being “the most profitable club in the world” was a discussion point.",
      "Then, within his interview with The Times, he admitted that he was also comparing Amorim’s time at United with the start of Arteta’s reign at the Emirates. He said: “You look at Arteta at Arsenal - He had a miserable time for the first couple of years.”",
      "What the overlooks is that Arteta took over in December 2019, he won the FA Cup in 2020 and to win a trophy in his first season was a game-changer.",
      "Well, Amorim blew that chance in the Europa League final last May and so how on earth can you compare the two? Answer: you can’t. On many levels. And the reality is that even the FA Cup might not have saved Arteta the following season. But the Covid era probably did.",
      "Arsenal, like the rest of football, were playing in front of nearly empty stadiums through the pandemic and that might have saved Arteta when they lost 1-0 at home to Burnley. Their home form was atrocious. They were in a mess. The results were so bad that they were flirting with a relegation scrap. Arsenal’s then director of football Edu even gave Arteta the dreaded vote of confidence.",
      "The following year was not much better. But it was better. And yet they still blew up and missed out on the Champions League places. But Arteta still had the FA Cup.",
      "He dined out on that until the 2022-23 season when they became unlikely title challengers, backed by a very supportive board and a lot of money spent in the transfer window.",
      "Now Arsenal fans are still a little divided on him. In the eyes of some fans, he has to deliver a big trophy this season. The club back him 100 per cent.",
      "But the point is that Arteta comparison just does not really add up. United fans have been so supportive on Amorim. They chant his name and are being patient. It has been tested lately.",
      "Ratcliffe and United have also splashed the cash and backed him in the market. They have bought a whole new forward line - Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha - to suit his unbreakable system. That’s some show of faith.",
      "I really admire it. But you cannot compare like for like. It does not always add up. As one United fan said to me: “We’re nowhere near where Arsenal or Liverpool were in that first five years.”",
      "Amorim, like Arteta, is young, inexperienced but inflexible. He talks well but his players are clearly not buying into or grasping his tactics and vision.",
      "United is also a monster of a football club. I’m not sure anyone can stomach three years of this soap opera.",
      "I genuinely thought United would make a battle for the top four this season. They spent big, had obvious flaws (midfield for a start) but it’s a decent squad.",
      "Yet they are underperforming massively. I am no longer so sure about Amorim. And the idea you can give him three years to get it right… well, I just don’t think anyone will wear that. Apart from, maybe, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, a Qatari banker and son of the former emir, has had his Manchester United takeover plans revisited. Back in 2023, his bid was up against one submitted by the eventual new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS.",
      "United opened their doors to investment and after a lengthy process in 2023 it was INEOS and Ratcliffe who snapped up nearly a 30 per cent stake in the club. He's now openly discussed the early stages of his ownership, leaving many pondering what might have been under Sheikh Jassim's reign. Two years ago, it was reported that the Qatari billionaire was competing with INEOS for a full takeover of the club. His team expressed at the time their desire to return the club to its \"former glories\" and boasted the financial muscle to make it happen.",
      "Forbes has previously given us a glimpse into Sheikh Jassim's personal fortune, rumoured to be around £900million. However, the Al-Thani family of which he is a member is believed to have a combined net worth of £125billion, more than enough to buy United outright.",
      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories,\" their statement read. \"The bid will be completely debt-free, via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation. \"It will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",
      "\"The vision of the bid is for Manchester United to be renowned for footballing excellence, and regarded as the greatest football club in the world.\"",
      "However, it was INEOS who secured a minority shareholding in the club two years ago. Following what has been a disappointing beginning to his United ownership, the co-owner has now urged for patience.",
      "\"There are two halves to a football team - there is the business side and the sports side,\" Ratcliffe acknowledged on the Business podcast.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor, is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"It's like a Formula 1 car, the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be. So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high level of football.\"",

      "Roy Keane is known as one of the finest players of his generation. However, the former Republic of Ireland star has cut out of a fine career in the media in recent years following his retirement from playing the beautiful game.",
      "During his 12-year spell at Manchester United, the Irishman won seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups, four Community Shields, and the Champions League in 1999. Since retiring, the 54-year-old has forged a hugely successful career in punditry after managerial stints with Sunderland and Ipswich Town.",
      "Keane is now best known for his sardonic take on the game and for his brutal dressing down of players, and will be on duty for ITV for their coverage of England vs Wales on Thursday evening. While he is renowned for his hard-man persona, Keane has also demonstrated a softer side to him in recent years.",
      "Adding to his stacked bank balance, Keane worked with Adidas on the launch of their 2023 Spezial Autumn/Winter collection, and while there's no confirmation as to how much he pocketed from his work for the brand, CEO of Onside John Trainor told Business Plus that Keane may have made as much as £851,000.",
      "Keane has been married to wife Theresa Doyle since 1997, with the pair meeting during Keane's days at Nottingham Forest. The couple now have five children; Shannon, Caragh, Aidan, Leah and Alanna, as well as two grandchildren.",
      "Speaking to The Mirror on meeting his partner, Keane said: \"I spotted a beautiful girl in a club in town. Her name was Theresa Doyle but she blanked me.",
      "\"She was in a steady relationship and didn't seem at all impressed by Roy Keane, the great footballer. In fact, I think my reputation was as a downer for all kinds of reasons. From time to time we ran into each other around Nottingham. I knew some of her friends, who told me Theresa was a dentist's assistant. Eventually, after her relationship broke up, she relented and we went out together. I was in love.\"",
      "The couple tied the knot at the Church of Our Lady Crowned in Mayfield near Keane's home town in Cork. \"I don't really mention her in public,\" he told the Sunday Times. \"But in fairness to her, she has been a rock in my life.",
      "\"Just brilliant. She reads me better than I read myself. I wouldn't say Theresa likes every part of the package. She knows I haven't got a halo over my head. Actually, that's what she likes about me. She also knows I am not the nastiest person in the world.\"",
      "Keane's daughter Leah is engaged to Southampton star Taylor Harwood-Bellis. The couple have been dating for some time and after announcing their engagement last year, they are now expecting a child.",
      "Keane has discussed his daughter's partner in good graces. After the defender's engagement to Keane's daughter was mentioned, he jokingly said: \"It’s not done and dusted yet. Things can change very quickly in the Keane household, let me tell you!\"",
      "However, the Premier League icon has praised his Hardwood-Bellis, on and off the pitch. Speaking of his future son-in-law, Keane said: \"He’s got a goal threat in him, even playing for Southampton. It’s nice for him. He’s a nice kid, his family’s done a good job.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Brentford’s chief operating officer Ameesh Manek as their new director of football operations - making him the third individual to move from west London to the north west in just three months.",
      "The club's pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo was well documented, eventually finishing with the Cameroon winger moving to Manchester for £71million, but since then two off-pitch signings have been made to aid United.",
      "Manek will leave Brentford after spending three years at the club and his role will involve him overseeing the running of United’s Carrington training ground. He will take charge of travel, security, training facilities, staff management and infrastructure as United look to change the day-to-day running of the club. He is the latest appointment made by chief executive officer Omar Berrada and his remit will see him work across the men’s and women’s teams.",
      "Manek continues the path of people going from west London to Manchester after Stephen Torpey started work as the Red Devils’ academy director two weeks ago. He was previously responsible for re-opening the Brentford academy in 2022.",
      "United spent weeks trying to land Mbeumo's signature in the summer with the forward enjoying his best season to date last term. Brentford dug their heels in and eventually got the type of fee they wanted in a deal that appeared to suit all parties.",
      "Despite the team's obvious struggles this term Mbeumo has been a bright spark. His first goal came in the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby and he's also netted in the Premier League. He did have a forgettable first return to Brentford with United losing 3-1 in the capital less than a fortnight ago.",
      "The Bees have had to deal with wholesale changes over the summer. Alongside Mbeumo, captain Christian Norgaard left for Arsenal whilst Yoane Wissa, who was another of their source of goals, left on deadline day to join Newcastle. That was all after manager Thomas Frank left.",
      "He was hired by Tottenham after several impressive years with Brentford, which began with them in the Championship. Since Keith Andrews took over in the summer the club have won just two of seven games and sit two spots above the relegation zone.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "To be fair to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, he is not one of those owners who tries to sweet-talk the supporters. No currying favours with the fans or cuddling up to the common people for the billionaire who has binned subsidised staff meals at Manchester United.",
      "“I got a lot of flak for the free lunches but no-one has ever given me a free lunch,” says generous Jim. Perhaps not.",
      "But targeting office workers enjoying a crumb of a perk while owners have creamed off hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends over the past ten years is a rotten look. And it is a look made even more rotten by Ratcliffe rattling off a cheap eulogy about the owners who have creamed off those hundreds of millions.",
      "“They get a bad rap,” claims Ratcliffe. \"But they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.”",
      "Here is what they are passionate about, Jim. Making money. Tons of it.",
      "According to BBC Verify, the Glazers did put in some of their own cash in their highly-leveraged buyout in the summer of 2005 - a buyout worth just shy of £800million. The Glazers invested £273million of their own cash. But since then, nothing. Nil.",
      "Between listing the club on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012 and 2022, the Glazers sold £555million worth of shares. And since 2012, the club has paid out £125million in directors’ fees. As, for the most part, half of the directors have been Glazers, that is an extra £63million for the family.",
      "In 2024, again according to BBC Verify, the Glazers then received £732million from Ratcliffe for what would become, roughly, a 30 percent stake in the club. No wonder ‘they are really passionate about the club’. It has been a cash cow of monumental proportions for them.",
      "All the while, of course, debt has been loaded onto the club. And Ratcliffe expects fans to believe the Glazers ‘get a bad rap’? Ratcliffe expects fans to believe the Glazers ‘are really nice people’?",
      "This is from the bloke who claims to be some sort of dyed-in-the-wool United supporter, albeit one who once had a Chelsea season ticket. Oh, and now, the fans should be reassured that Ratcliffe and his Ineos crew seem to be in charge of the day-to-day running of the club and the football operation.",
      "“We are local and they (the Glazers) are the other side of the pond,” says Ratcliffe. “That’s a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We are here with feet on the ground.”",
      "Local? Feet on the ground? Ratcliffe moved his tax residence from Hampshire to Monaco five years ago.",
      "As a tax exile, he is probably only allowed to be in the United Kingdom for 90 days a year. When he gave his first round of post-takeover media interviews, he gave them in his office in Knightsbridge.",
      "In his interview with The Business podcast - produced by The Times and Sunday Times - Ratcliffe appears to suggest Ruben Amorim will be given three years to prove himself a good coach of United.",
      "For what it is worth, I whole-heartedly agree that Amorim should be given a lot more time. But throughout this latest interview, you get the idea Ratcliffe is more concerned about the financial and commercial success of the operation than he is about the football success.",
      "“Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view,” he says, before adding: “From that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.”",
      "Profit first, high-level of football second. That sums it up. And when it happens, Ratcliffe and those ‘really nice people’, the Glazers, will make more fortunes to go with the ones they have already got.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have disagreed about who should become the next Manchester United manager, if Ruben Amorim is sacked.",
      "Amorim's position at Old Trafford is safe for now following United's much-needed 2-0 win against Sunderland last Saturday. The 40-year-old had come under severe pressure heading into the game but the Reds produced a solid performance to record three crucial points.",
      "However, there is still talk that Amorim could face the sack should results not improve on a consistent basis. Indeed, Amorim's future was once again a topic on Thursday's episode of The Overlap, with Keane suggesting that Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone should be United's first-choice replacement if a change is made.",
      "Simeone, 55, has been Atletico's manager since 2011 and has cemented himself as one of the best coaches on the planet in that time, helping the Madrid club win a number of major trophies. They include La Liga twice, Copa del Rey once and the Europa League twice, with Simeone boasting a 59 per cent win rate from his 749 matches.",
      "When asked about who should replace Amorim if United decide to sack him, Keane said: \"I've said it for years but I’d like to see Atletico Madrid's Simeone go in there. I know his mate (Andrea Berta) has gone to Arsenal, but I think he would just create havoc, good havoc.",
      "\"I think he would rock up to that place and say ‘this is how you do things’. There is no guarantee but I’d just like to see his personality there with his track record.",
      "\"People may say about the style of football, but they beat Real Madrid and scored five. This idea that he is defensive, he doesn’t like his team giving up goals and chances, but he can play a bit.",
      "\"They have that fighting spirit, he’s on the sidelines causing [havoc]. I like a big personality. Andrea Berta was a big part of the success at Atletico with the recruitment side of it.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Scholes offered a different assessment when speaking on The Overlap's Fan Debate earlier this week and believes that Newcastle United's Eddie Howe should be next in line.",
      "Howe replaced Steve Bruce as Newcastle's next head coach following the Saudi-led takeover in 2021 and he has since done an excellent job on Tyneside, transforming them from a relegation-threatened club to one that is challenging - and winning - trophies and finishing in the Champions League places.",
      "\"Eddie Howe, Eddie Howe,\" Scholes said. \"I'm not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Sir Jim Ratcliffe offered his verdict on Amorim's future and gave him the vote of confidence, claiming that he is prepared to give the Portuguese three more years to prove himself.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester City are currently fifth in the Premier League as we head into the international break, having had a rocky start to the season. But Pep Guardiola's squad seems to have bounced back from their early struggles and now appear to be a force to be reckoned with.",
      "City experienced back-to-back losses to Tottenham and Brighton at the beginning of this campaign, casting doubt on their ability to contend for the title. However, their luck has taken a dramatic turn. A 3-0 derby triumph against Manchester United was followed by a hard-fought 1-1 draw away at Arsenal.",
      "Before the international break, the club managed to put themselves in fifth place in the top flight, just three points shy of the lead. The ever-dependable Erling Haaland continues to perform exceptionally well.",
      "However, the player chose to reject the London club in favour of staying in Manchester. He has since been rewarded with a two-year contract extension and his deal will run until 2031.",
      "Guardiola has played Savinho in the club's last two league matches, which ended in 5-1 and 1-0 victories. His absence during their slow start might not be a coincidence as their form seems to have improved with his increased playtime.",

      "But Guardiola's ability to convince the Brazilian to stay over the summer, while overseeing his impressive development so far this season, could yet prove to be the City manager's next great masterstroke.",
      "Club captain Silva is at a pivotal point in his City career. The Portuguese star has won everything there is to win in sky blue but his current contract expires next summer and he could potentially leave on a free transfer.",
      "Speaking before City's Champions League match against his former team Monaco, Silva confessed he \"knows what to do\" when his contract ends and reports from Portugal suggest that could mean bidding farewell.",
      "Portuguese publication Record reports that Benfica have a contract ready for Silva to sign in January. As they are an overseas club, they would be able to sign the 31-year-old to a pre-contract agreement and he would then join them in the summer.",
      "From City's perspective, Silva has been a valuable servant and remains the side's skipper, but the player has always reiterated that it would be a \"goal\" to play for his boyhood club. Whilst allowing him to depart for free is not ideal, City's frontline is already so deep and Silva has earned the right to go wherever his heart desires with the club's best wishes.",
      "The influential Rodri could yet again find himself on the sidelines after he was substituted in the 1-0 victory against Brentford. It is believed he has suffered a hamstring injury.",
      "This setback comes just months after he returned from an ACL injury that restricted him to just three league appearances last season. Rodri is often cited with making City tick and in his absence, Nico Gonzalez was purchased from Porto for £50m.",
      "Although he is young, he hasn't made too much of an impact and so with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri's injury struggles a concern and the Spaniard approaching 30 years of age, it could be time to plan for the future.",
      "Carlos Baleba was targeted by rivals United this summer and the Brighton star has a £115m asking price. According to ESPN, City were also in the race to sign him and the club should pounce now before their adversaries do to shore up the base of their midfield for the foreseeable.",
      "Baleba has been a revelation for the Seagulls and at just 21 he could star for years to come. He would provide the perfect cover for Rodri whilst acting as his eventual successor. The midfielder could soon become the first choice if City decide to cash in on Rodri, with Real Madrid reportedly showing interest in signing him next summer for a suggested £130m, according to the Daily Star.",

      "Saudi Arabian billionaire Turki Al-Sheikh has a net worth that reportedly pales in comparison to that of current Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, following his cryptic message regarding the club's future. United are currently in a period where the Glazers can sell the entirety of their stake in the club thanks to their 'drag along' rights being activated.",
      "This is common practice in the business world as it prevents majority owners from being held captive to the whims of the minority stakeholder. Despite the Glazers holding the power to sell from underneath Ratcliffe, there has been little talk of this happening until Wednesday night.",
      "In a surprising tweet, Saudi businessman Al-Sheikh suggested that the club could soon be owned by new investors. \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor,\" he wrote.",
      "If you are a fan of boxing, Al-Sheikh will be no stranger to you. Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, he is the founder of the Riyadh Season, which is a series of entertainment, cultural and sporting events used to advertise the country of Saudi Arabia.",
      "Thanks to the money on offer, the Riyadh Season has proven to be a hit for the Middle East country. Al-Sheikh has taken a keen interest in boxing and has organised several super fights, including the likes of Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk and Canelo Alvarez vs Terence Crawford.",
      "He has also managed to attract the investment of WWE with the professional wrestling titan holding several Premium Live Events (PLEs or PPVs) in the country. This will soon include Wrestlemania, which is set to be hosted in 2027.",
      "Away from combat sports, Al-Sheikh also has a hand in football having purchased Spanish club Almeria in 2019. The club currently sit ninth in the second tier of Spanish football.",
      "In 2024, CEO Today magazine reported that Turki Al-Sheikh's net worth is believed to be around $2.8bn (£2.08bn). To put this in perspective, Forbes estimates that Ratcliffe is currently worth a staggering $17.2bn (£12.8bn).",
      "As for the Glazers, they are thought to have a net worth valued at a combined $10bn (£7.46bn), also according to Forbes.",
      "While he did not insinuate that he is the person looking to buy United, Al-Sheikh probably would not be able to even if he so desired. As is clear, he does not have the financial assets near that of those currently owning the club.",
      "His best bet would be to make up part of a consortium. But, as mentioned, there is no insinuation that he has any interest in owning the Reds.",

      "Manchester United invited club correspondents into the Old Trafford boardroom last season.",
      "Omar Berrada and Dan Ashworth spoke on record during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session before the Liverpool game, touching on Erik ten Hag, transfers and much more.",
      "The most interesting quotes were about the controversial decision to keep Ten Hag in charge.",
      "When asked about Ten Hag's contract extension after he lifted the FA Cup, Berrada said: \"Again, so in terms of the contract, that was a decision that was taken prior to both of our arrivals.",
      "\"But as I said before, we're very happy with that decision. Erik has our full backing and we have worked very closely together, as Dan said before, in this transfer window. We're going to continue working very closely with him to help him get the best results out of the team.\"",
      "Berrada was asked whether Ten Hag would still be backed if there was a bad run of results and said: \"Do we still believe in Erik? Absolutely. We think Erik is the right coach for us and we’re fully backing him.\"",
      "Responding to a question about inheriting a coach, Ashworth said: \"Well, it happened at Newcastle with Eddie Howe [during his time there], it happened at West Brom, Tony Mowbray was in place. Very rarely do you go into a job as a sporting director and there's no manager in place.",
      "\"I didn't start until July 1, so none whatsoever [say in keeping Ten Hag]. All I can do is reiterate what I remember saying, I've really enjoyed working with Erik for the last eight weeks.\"",
      "In no uncertain terms, Berrada and Ashworth made it clear that Ten Hag retained the backing of the board - but the Dutchman was sacked 57 days later following a defeat to West Ham.",
      "Those comments are relevant because Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed Ruben Amorim, saying on The Business podcast: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Asked if the Glazers have told him to sack his head coach, Ratcliffe replied: “It’s not going to happen.”",
      "He added: \"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Some consider Ratcliffe's comments as a cast-iron guarantee of giving three years to Amorim, but you only need to look at what Berrada and Ashworth said about Ten Hag to show that his assurances are worthless. The winds change quickly in football and Amorim needs results to survive.",
      "Amorim is thought to have a good relationship with Ratcliffe. During this summer's pre-season tour, he revealed that Ratcliffe sends him GIFs after matches, but he will be sent a P45 if results don't improve.",
      "Sunderland felt like a must-win for Amorim ahead of the October international break, following another setback against Brentford which saw the pressure increase on his shoulders again.",
      "Amorim's failure to win back-to-back Premier League games during his tenure is concerning and he must dispose of that unwanted record sooner rather than later. The performance against Sunderland was a step in the right direction, but it's fair to say Amorim is not out of the woods.",
      "It's also worth noting that Ratcliffe said the only thing he can say. Imagine the uproar if Ratcliffe came out and questioned Amorim, suggesting that he could be on borrowed time?",
      "The meaningful conversations about Amorim are held in private. Ratcliffe would not reveal he was having second thoughts about United's manager during a conversation on a podcast.",
      "United will play Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking on October 28, and it feels like a decision on Amorim's future will be made at a similar time of the season.",

      "Welcome to the Manchester United takeover blog on Thursday, October 9.",
      "We are bringing you a special live blog this lunchtime after news this morning of a surprise takeover of the club potentially being on the cards. Turki Al-Sheikh, the Saudi Arabian billionaire and founder of the Riyadh Season, suggested on Wednesday night that a takeover was in 'advanced stages'.",
      "Since then, we have discovered how much the Glazers would be willing to sell United for and the response within the club since the news was revealed. Throughout the afternoon we shall be updating you with the latest information on a potential takeover.",
      "As well as that, we shall also be providing you with news surrounding Sir Jim Ratcliffe's interview prior to Turki's comments and more on the future of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Take a look at all the latest United takeover news below...",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Gary Neville claimed that he's changed his mind after recently meeting Bruno Fernandes. The former United defender said: \"I say Bruno [changed my mind after meeting him personally].",
      "\"I met him for half an hour, and I thought it was fair to say that when people talk about him at the club, they say he’s a good type and he’s hardworking.",
      "\"He really looks after the staff, and that was the thing that impressed me most when the staff said he looked after the staff; he looks after people.\"",
      "According to the Mirror, the Glazers would consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake in United, which is more than double what the English giants are currently worth on the stock market.",
      "The report acknowledges speculation that Turki Al-Sheikh could launch a bid – despite what the club have said. The Mirror reckons that the Saudi billionaire would have to start the bidding at around £5.2billion, just to stand a realistic chance of persuading the Glazers to sell up.",
      "Manchester United have received a Bryan Mbeumo boost during the October international break.",
      "The Cameroonian arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford this summer for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons. The forward, who scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season, has made a positive start to life under Ruben Amorim with two goals and an assist so far across all competitions.",
      "Mbeumo has been a regular in the league, having played 90 minutes in all but one fixture so far in 2024/25. The 26-year-old is currently away on international duty with Cameroon, where he has continued his fine form.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has defended the Glazer family's ownership of the Reds.",
      "The Glazers have come under intense scrutiny from fans for their stewardship of United ever since their leveraged acquisition in 2005 saddled the club with a hefty debt - currently estimated at around £725million. Numerous fan groups voiced their opposition to the deal 20 years ago.",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 per cent stake in United in a $1.2bn deal at the start of 2024 after striking a deal with the Glazer family. The Ineos CEO was handed oversight over footballing and strategic matters at the club.",
      "Read more here",
      "In the midst of all this, Ratcliffe's interview that was made public on Wednesday has been buried.",
      "However, he made no indication that he was on the verge of leaving United and insisted that his recent budget cuts are to secure the long-term future of the club.",
      "The more cash you've got, the better squad you can build. It’s like a Formula One car - the better car you can build, the quicker you go. The better your squad, the better your football should be. So a lot of what we've done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing. If you look at our results for last year, we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever. We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we weren't in the Champions League. Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.",

      "United have been surprised at the claim of a fresh takeover bid being prepared.",
      "Turki Al-Sheikh has written on social media to suggest United are on the brink of new investment - causing confusion among supporters and staff within the club.",
      "There has been no indication that Sheikh Jassim could be the man returning to make a fresh offer for United.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "If the Glazers were to sell United they would be looking for a whopping £5bn.",
      "Currently, the club is worth just £2bn.",
      "However, the American family are factoring in the potential the club has to rise in value, into their price tag.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "While the Saudi did not suggest that he is the person looking to purchase United, he has fueled speculation that he could be the person seeking to acquire the team.",
      "However, if he is, then he might need some wealthy backers helping him.",
      "Take a look at his net worth compared to those running the club right now, HERE.",
      "To kick things off, let's see what Turki has said to fuel the takeover talk today.",
      "Writing on X last night, the Saudi billionaire made this statement:",
      "The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor."

      "Manchester United midfielder Mainoo has not started in the Premier League this season, with Ruben Amorim stating Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes for a place in the team.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to improve aspects of his game. The 20-year-old has not had a settled role during Amorim's tenure and requested to leave on loan for the sake of minutes in the summer.",

      "Thomas Tuchel has explained that Mainoo must play regularly to be considered in his plans.",
      "Meanwhile, the prospect of Mainoo dropping down to represent England's U21s has been explored, with manager Lee Carsley revealing he's been in contact with the United graduate.",
      "When asked if Mainoo or Adam Wharton could play for England's U21s, Carlsey explained to the Daily Mail: \"They're definitely in consideration. They're in the senior bracket. I think it's fair to say that they're more senior end than 21s end. But I think there's always the option.",
      "\"I've got in contact with both of them. So they're players that are highly rated within the system. I think it's one that we just assess every camp. I'm sure they're both pitching to being in the senior team.\"",
      "Carsley expanded on players in a similar position: \"It's the same to all of the players. We pick them because they're either playing really well at their clubs or we feel that they've got high potential.",
      "\"So we can't dictate their playing time, what the clubs give them or the minutes that they play. But what we can do is, I can do that when they're here with us. So I'll make sure that they get well looked after and they get their minutes and hopefully send them back to their clubs in a strong position.\"",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place and he provided detailed thoughts on the youngster when he spoke at a press conference ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",

      "Billionaire INEOS chief Ratcliffe has overseen the culling of up to 450 jobs at United since he bought a minority stake in United, as well as stopping the policy of free meals for club staff.",
      "Defending his savage cost-cutting decisions, Ratcliffe said: “The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.”",
      "Ratcliffe, who also angered United fans by raising match-day ticket prices to £66 per game, with no concessions for children or pensioners, said improving the club's financial performance was the key to sustained success on the pitch.",

      "Rooney and his team-mates had completed their task by defeating Sunderland at the Stadium of Light and were preparing to celebrate in the North East, with City trailing QPR as the match entered its closing moments.",

      "QPR entered the season's final day facing potential relegation, but results elsewhere meant that they were aware they would remain in the top flight before the match concluded.",

      "\"If we had wanted Man City to win the league, would it not have been a little risky to have waited until the very last minute to let them score?",
      "\"We could have let them win 4–0 or 5–0 and gone home. But we played a strong team, the manager wanted to win that game. It wasn't our reserve team.\"",
      "Rooney reignited the debate earlier this year, when he shared his feelings during an episode of the Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "When asked about that day, he responded: \"Obviously that was a tough one that... but again didn't Paddy Kenny turn the ball in for two goals? QPR knew they were safe and City get it to 2-2, then they just boot the ball back to them.",
      "\"They had Cisse on the pitch, Joey Barton got sent off for acting stupid. Who else was it? Shaun Wright-Phillips and Nedum Onuoha diving about.\"",

      "The United captain turned down enticing offers from the likes of Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad last summer, with his heart seemingly set on remaining as a key figure in Ruben Amorim's rebuild at Old Trafford.",
      "While there have been recent suggestions that the 31-year-old will want away from United after next summer's World Cup, sources close to Fernandes have told BBC Sport that this is not the case. Fernandes' current deal runs until 2027, with the option to extend by another year.",
      "And with regards to his future, Fernandes is also said to only be open to representing teams in major European leagues, making United a perfect suitor at present - especially if they can turn their fortunes around and secure Champions League football for 2026/27.",
      "Meanwhile, United currently sit 10th in the league standings at present with three wins, three losses and a draw to show for their opening seven fixtures. Couple that with an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two's Grimsby Town in August, and it's clear to see why Fernandes has been linked with a move away from the north west.",
      "However, currently sitting as one of Amorim's most influential players and one of the first names on the manager's team-sheet, Fernandes may be aware that the grass may not be greener elsewhere.",
      "It comes as Turki Al-Sheikh has dropped a cryptic message about the future of Manchester United's ownership. The Glazer Family currently hold the rights to sell their entire stake in the club due to the activation of 'drag along' rights, which prevent majority owners from being held hostage by minority stakeholders.",
      "Despite the Glazers holding the power to force Sir Jim Ratcliffe to sell his stake, there has been very little discussion of such an instance coming to fruition until Wednesday evening. In an almost out-of-the-blue post on X, Saudi businessman Al-Sheikh hinted that the club could soon change hands.",
      "He wrote: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners.\"",
      "It came just hours after a rare interview with Ratcliffe was published, in which, the Ineos head gave no indication that he was planning to relinquish control of the club.",

      "Saudi government official and chairman of the General Entertainment Authority Turki Al-Sheikh has fuelled speculation surrounding a Manchester United takeover after claiming that he has heard the club is 'in an advanced stage' of being sold to new investors.",
      "On Christmas Eve 2023, United confirmed that Sir Jim Ratcliffe had won the race to invest in the club. Despite initial hopes from the fanbase that it would be a majority takeover, Ineos settled to purchase a minority stake which gave them control of the football project.",
      "Since February 2024, Ratcliffe and co. have been making decisions on the football side of the club. While some decisions, like the appointment of Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have been heralded as successes, cost-cutting measures and the pursuit of Dan Ashworth before cutting ties after less than six months have damaged the perception of Ratcliffe with some sections of the fanbase.",
      "In a surprising move on Wednesday night, Al-Sheikh, who is best known for his work in boxing and helping to create super fights, expressed his delight at news of a potential takeover at United. \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor,\" he wrote on X.",
      "\"I hope he’s better than the previous owners.\" At this stage, there has been no suggestion that the Glazers were preparing to sell their stake in United.",
      "However, back in May it was reported that the Glazers could now activate their 'drag along' rights. This means that the majority investor can sell the entirety of the club without the minority investor, in this case Ratcliffe, blocking them.",
      "This is a common clause in the business world and its aim is to stop minority investors from holding the majority owner to ransom by refusing to sell their stake. Speaking on The Business Podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times, this week, Ratcliffe made no suggestion that his time at Old Trafford was coming to an end.",
      "\"If you look at our results for last year we have the highest revenues ever. Profitability, the second highest ever,\" he explained.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of results, and we were not in the Champions League. Those numbers will get better.",
      "\"Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\" Ratcliffe also insisted that the Glazers have not told him to sack Ruben Amorim who has endured a mixed start to the Premier League campaign.",

      "Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Paul Scholes have made their preferences clear on who should take charge if Manchester United lose faith in Ruben Amorim.",
      "The head coach has faced mounting scrutiny after a disastrous start to the season, which included an embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, alongside disappointing league results. Rumours circulated that Amorim might face the axe had he failed to secure victory against Sunderland on Saturday, though a 2-0 triumph over the Black Cats has provided some respite.",
      "Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has pledged to afford Amorim time, though it seems unlikely United would persist with the Portuguese coach should they find themselves languishing in the lower reaches of the table like last season, particularly after splashing out over £200million on fresh talent during the summer.",
      "Should United decide to act, club icons Neville, Scholes and Keane have been forthright about their preferred successor. Both Neville and Keane would opt for long-standing Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone.",
      "During an appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his respect for the passionate Argentine, who has guided Atletico to La Liga glory and Champions League finals.",
      "Keane said: \"I've said it for years, I'd like Atletico Madrid's Simeone to go in there. I'd like to see him go there. I know his mate has gone to Arsenal [Andrea Berta, who left Atletico to join the Gunners as sporting director].",
      "\"I think he would just create havoc, but good havoc. He'd rock up to that place. No guarantees, but I'd just like to see his personality, his track record.",
      "\"People might think styles of football, [but] they scored five against Real Madrid [winning 5-2] last weekend. He doesn't like his teams giving up too many goals or chances, but they can play a bit and fight.",
      "\"At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago... the team aren't as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He's on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I'd like a big personality.\"",
      "However, Keane isn't advocating for Amorim's immediate dismissal. He quipped: \"I'd still say give the man a chance, absolutely. Another week!\" Neville supported Keane's view, stating: \"I think I'd go with that. I'd go with Simeone.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Scholes backed Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, though he expressed doubts about his long-serving assistant, Jason Tindall, accompanying him. He said: \"I'm not sure about his mate [Tindall], but definitely him.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim appears likely to get more time, based on Ratcliffe's recent remarks on The Times' The Business podcast. He said: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",

      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",

      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "The England international celebrated his latest call-up by Thomas Tuchel by getting on the scoresheet for the Catalan giants.",
      "Pedri delivered the perfect ball after Barca had hounded their opponents high up the pitch, and Rashford timed his run from the left with precision before firing it past Odysseas Vlachodimos, on loan from Newcastle, with his left foot.",
      "The goal marked the seventh consecutive match in which Rashford has made a goal contribution, and he now has three goals and five assists in 10 appearances since making his loan move from Manchester United.",
      "Rashford has more contributions than United stars Bryan Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes and Benjamin Sesko combined.",
      "The 27-year-old's efforts on Sunday were in vain, however, as Barcelona crashed to a 4-1 defeat.",
      "Former United star Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Isaac Romero doubled the home side's lead. Rashford's impressive strike then came in first-half injury time.",
      "Late goals from Jose Angel Carmona and Akor Adams ensured a big upset, however, as Sevilla claimed three points.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick said: \"The first half was not good for us, they played one against one and very aggressive.",
      "\"We had no solutions, that's not a good thing. But in the second half I really appreciate the team's reaction.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about the two goals, we don't want excuses. We have to focus on the first half, but the most important thing is the reaction. This defeat is important and after the break we will fight for all the titles. That's what we want, we are a good team.\"",

      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",

      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",

      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",

      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres’ agent has revealed how close Manchester United came to signing the Arsenal star in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Arsenal‘s top priority in the summer was to sign an elite striker as they have been short in this department in recent seasons and Gyokeres was eventually preferred to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, Arsenal’s pursuit of Gyokeres was far from simple as Sporting Lisbon went back on a gentleman’s agreement, while they faced competition from Man Utd and the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Man Utd also identified Gyokeres as a leading target, though they missed out on the 27-year-old, who was intent on a move to Arsenal.",
      "Arsenal’s patience eventually paid off as they paid around £64m to sign Gyokeres, who has three goals in his seven Premier League appearances this season.",
      "Now, Jonathan Chalkias, who is assistant to agent Hasan Cetinkaya, has provided details on Gyokeres’ move to the Premier League, claiming Man Utd and Sporting Lisbon “finalised a deal behind their back”.",
      "“It was such a lot of money [from the Saudi Pro League], it was well over 400 million net per year,” Chalkias said on the Studio Allsvenskan podcast.",
      "READ: Premier League CRISIS Rankings: Forest 2nd, West Ham 3rd, but what of Liverpool and Man Utd?",
      "“It’s a ridiculous amount of money. It’s better Viktor answers that question some day, we didn’t once push him in that way.",
      "“I think at the end of the day, money comes and money goes. Making this move to Arsenal gives us good marketing, too. He was actually never even that way, he didn’t think about it.",
      "“But there was also the problem with Sporting that they had finalised the deal with United behind our backs.",
      "“They [Sporting] had agreed because United paid a much higher transfer fee, but they didn’t get any attention. Every time they called it was, ‘no, no, no’, because he wanted to go to Arsenal.”",
      "Chalkias has also revealed why Gyokeres was in favour of a move to Arsenal.",
      "“It’s just that they haven’t had a new one [striker] in the last two years, Arteta spoke with him, to go to a club that hasn’t won in a few years,” Chalkias added.",
      "“Getting to do it on the biggest stage, living in London, playing for Arsenal, it doesn’t get much bigger.",
      "“And this is a club that can not only win the Premier League, they can win the Champions League, they are an incredible team. And there’s a lot of talk about their defensive and midfield play and that they need a striker to score those goals.”",
      "On the Arsenal newbie’s start at the Emirates, he added: “Really good, I think not above expectations but good.",
      "“I think everything will be better when he settles down but he has started every game and they are leading the Premier League and they have faced City, United away, Newcastle away and Liverpool away, not that bad.",
      "“I think if he just does what he’s good at he’ll score many goals there.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims that Liverpool are “on their knees” after a couple of losses, as he describe one summer signing as doing “alright.”",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Unlikely. Kylian Mbappe is 15 ahead of the Arsenal man.",
      "Arsenal still aren’t ‘100% the best in Europe’ but Arteta’s 2025 nonsense could come true in 2026 if one Gunners star pulls their finger out.",

      "He scored a goal on debut and has now taken his tally to four goals in six appearances across all competitions, becoming the latest in a long list of players to thrive having immediately escaped Old Trafford.",
      "Now on international duty, ahead of Denmark’s World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Greece, Hojlund offered a damning 13-word explanation as to why he’s rediscovered his touch.",
      "“Not much has happened other than me getting into a good football team,” he said. Ouch.",
      "Hojlund elaborated: “I’ve played a lot and it’s been going really well. I’ve felt fit and sharp. I’ve made sure I was ready, and I did a lot of things off the pitch during my summer break to be ready for the upcoming season.",
      "“I don’t know if there is a difference. In the subconscious, there may be. But I always try to tell myself that I am a good footballer who can always score goals, regardless of whether I haven’t scored in 20 games or I am in the group I am in now.”",
      "Denmark boss Brian Reimer also aimed a sly dig at United in agreeing with the striker.",
      "He said: “The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced. It is more important than which league you play in.”",

      "“The same can be said for Marcus Rashford – he joined Aston Villa on loan in January last season and got four goals and six assists in in 11 starts. Now he has joined Barcelona on loan and he’s flying. He already has three goals and five assists in his first 10 games and he scored an amazing goal in the Champions League against Newcastle.",

      "That track record includes a now 14-year stint at Atleti and it is not an exaggeration to say he has revolutionised the club in that time. While they were once one of Real Madrid’s biggest sources of joy, Simeone turned them into a thorn in both Madrid and Barcelona’s sides.",

      "Keane’s managerial record is not quite as glittering as his playing days. While he did guide Sunderland to the Premier League, he did not do the same at his next club Ipswich and went 14 games without a win in his first full year in charge.",
      "By the time he was sacked, Ipswich were 21st in the league in what was Keane’s last managerial role. He has since been an assistant boss to Martin O’Neill at Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and the Irish national team.",

      "“In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he’s going to put structure in there.",
      "“Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, ‘he said Sean Dyche’, no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.”",

      "“But the key is that you need to have a guy that obviously has got a clear idea but puts some kind of a structure in place that the players buy into and that you get a spark from the players. Because they’re not bad players, there’s plenty of good players there.",
      "“I’m sure that if they would play in a system that suits them, they really play at their best. I think you could see a fantastic Manchester United. Maybe Michael could well be the guy.",

      "We’ve done mood rankings. We’ve done manager rankings. But we see now that was only ever building up to this moment. Everything has been leading to this. The Crisis Rankings. Or CRISIS Rankings, because it does feel like this important and serious work merits a tiny bit of panicked ALL CAPS headloss.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League, anyway. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that.",
      "Sure we could do our usual thing of affecting a lofty superiority and pretending it’s all silly tish and daft fipsy. But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) as the barren wasteland of a dreary international break stretches out endlessly before us all, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Here, then, are the inaugural F365 Crisis Rankings, ranked from least to most crisis-ridden (which we’re pretty sure you could have worked out for yourselves).",
      "",
      "There absolutely are clubs for whom crisis talk can and does begin when a 19-match, trophy-winning unbeaten run comes to an end via a scrappy late goal at Everton. Crystal Palace are not one of those clubs.",
      "They probably aren’t going to do a Leicester after all. We’ll tell the children etc. but while a bit of a shame it is no crisis.",
      "Still if anything just about as far from crisis as it’s possible to be, at least until they lose two defenders to injury and/or a Glasner-enraging January transfer.",
      "READ: Everton spare Liverpool blushes but not Wirtz’s as huge Crystal Palace weakness laid bare",
      "",
      "A club all too familiar with crisis in recent years but currently well above all that kind of thing, thank you very much. They’ve got themselves a perfect new hero in Jack Grealish and have thus far made the awkward jump to a new ground and new surroundings look pretty straightforward indeed.",
      "Don’t look at all like they’re liable to get themselves into any real bother at all this season. Look far more likely to actually be proper good fun. Long-suffering Everton fans will still have the automatic defence response of expecting the worst at any moment, but honestly guys it’s all absolutely fine here isn’t it? Just enjoy it, would be our advice.",
      "There’s even a decent chance you might get to laugh at Liverpool quite a bit. And that’s been a while.",
      "",
      "Seems deeply quaint now, given the sheer depth and breadth of the assorted CRISIS levels now beleaguering other clubs up and down the country, but if you cast your mind back into the deep, distant past of about a fortnight ago you’ll remember that Arsenal were themselves quite deep in crisis. Because of the handbrake.",
      "Specifically, the handbrake that silly old Mikel Arteta refused to release in games against Liverpool and Manchester City.",
      "Said handbrake has since been released in games against Newcastle and West Ham which, coupled with Liverpool’s own seven-stages-of-crisis descent, has allowed Arsenal to go top of the table.",
      "And now they have every chance of opening up a really tidy lead from some kindly fixtures between the October and November interlulls having had to wade through some distinctly unpleasant games in August and September.",
      "Obviously Arsenal are Arsenal and thus can never be entirely crisis-free. There are two main pillars in the current attempts to paint the current favourites to the win the Premier League and Champions League as still mired in some kind of crisis.",
      "One was the really quite insane response to Arsenal maintaining their 100% Champions League record this season with a 2-0 win over Olympiacos, an event that was covered by our brave press with the kind of gravity normally reserved for the passing of a minor royal.",
      "The other crisis pillar for Arsenal – and this is one that only the winning of actual trophies will quell – is the Arsenally factor. They have a great opportunity here, but what if they just Arsenal it up?",
      "Related to this – a sub-pillar, if you will – is the fact they also really don’t like being called favourites. Because it inevitably invites subsequent accusations of bottling.",
      "And there really is no way out of this maze for Arsenal until, like their near neighbours, they manage to shut the talk down with an actual trophy. Because until then, the ridiculous reality of the noise around this most noise-generating of modern clubs is that the two things that can lead them to crisis town are a) good football results and b) bad football results. And celebrating wrong, obviously. Always with the celebrating wrong.",
      "",
      "We thought there would be a crisis. By rights there should have been a crisis. When you sell four of your back five to assorted big buggers, a crisis seems inevitable.",
      "But Andoni Iraola and Antoine Semenyo have had other ideas. Accepting the inevitable for the defence but holding firm on Semenyo is already looking like inspired pragmatic real-world transfer market realism from the Cherries. There’s a real skill for clubs in their situation in knowing when and where to fold and when to hold.",
      "Iraola still feels like the real genius behind all this, though. Thanking Gary O’Neil for his sterling work in keeping Bournemouth in the Premier League after they’d been Scott Parkered and moving him on to bring in Iraola must now go down as one of the biggest and most significant upgrades made by a member of the ‘Small 14’.",
      "As long as he remains in place, Bournemouth will be fine. Which does invite us to ponder the inevitable problem somewhere down the line. As wiser football minds than ours have opined: it is what it is.",
      "",
      "We are very, very suspicious of this Tottenham start. We’re not actually at all convinced they’re really any good at all, but we also have a sneaking feeling that they may get away with it far more often than not and end up very much in and around the top-four picture despite themselves.",
      "Also wouldn’t really be shocked at all if they’re 11th by the New Year. We’re keeping our options very much open here.",
      "We do think that a summer of upheaval could have ended up much, much worse for Spurs. For all the banterous nature of the Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze pursuits and their humiliating conclusions, Spurs have ended up…okay.",
      "They’ve strengthened the areas they needed to strengthen and without yet being entirely convincing are already reaping the benefits. That Leeds game was an absolutely perfect example of precisely the sort of game they would have wilted and lost last season in the face of a physical and psychological test.",
      "The simple fact that Spurs have won every game in which they’ve led this season is immensely encouraging given how p*ss-poor they were by that metric last year, and while it’s reasonable to ask questions about how precisely they got themselves into the pickles they did against Brighton or Wolves or Bodo/Glimt it must also be acknowledged that they found a way to at least get some of the way back out of them. That is not a trait one immediately associates with Spurs.",
      "Joao Palhinha may provoke grumbling among some Spurs purists for his no-nonsense game but he is exactly the player for which they have been crying out to have in their midfield for some time now. There’s a fight and steel about Spurs now, a willingness and acceptance that sometimes in this league you are going to have to earn your right to play.",
      "That Thomas Frank is also managing to get some decent output from encouraging Palhinha into more forward positions is also good news, suggesting a flexibility and thoughtfulness to both coach and player that is welcome at a club where things can get very dogmatic. We’re still very hopeful that Xavi Simons will eventually get up to the speed of things when given a run of games in a more settled role, and Mohammed Kudus is already looking far more like the season-one West Ham version than season-two.",
      "We’re not quite sure exactly how Spurs have only lost one game this season, but they have, and they’ve got themselves into a tidy position in three competitions. They are still Spurs, they will always be Spurs and they can always go fully and entirely Spurs, but right now there is no crisis here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland will be disappointed not to have come away from Manchester United with something. The very fact this is a sentence you can write with an entirely straight face tells you things are going pretty well for the Black Cats on the back of what looked for all the world like a dangerously premature promotion back to the big league.",
      "But an expert summer of recruitment from a transfer net cast far and wide has given them every chance. At the very, very least they won’t be getting relegated without a damn good fight and that is all one can reasonably ask of unexpected play-off winners when coming into the Premier League, really.",
      "Notable too that all their points have come against the established and settled Premier League set. There is nothing artificial or obviously deceptive about a set of results including wins over West Ham, Brentford and Forest alongside points against Palace and Villa. Those are results that indicate Sunderland are precisely what they currently appear to be: a perfectly capable mid-table Premier League side.",
      "Still a genuinely incredible effort if they can keep that up for another seven months, but now no reason really to think otherwise.",
      "",
      "Not currently in crisis, but definitely still on a crisis watchlist. The summer was hard and unpleasant for Newcastle, dominated as it was in the end by the Isak Saga and the great and at one time potentially never-ending quest for a replacement.",
      "They spent an awful lot of money on Nick Woltemade and it did have about it a whiff of desperation, but Newcastle was a club desperate for a new hero and he already has the look and air and most importantly goals of a man heading for beloved cult status at a place that loves its big number nines. We think everyone loves big number nines, really, but Newcastle definitely love big number nines.",
      "Results are on a general upward trend despite the late p*sser against Arsenal, and the fixture list for the month between October and November interlulls doesn’t look too bad at all either domestically or in the Champions League.",
      "Late November and into December look like potentially choppier waters, though, where keen crisis watchers might just need a close eye on Eddie Howe and the lads.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when everything was definitely going all 2024/25 after back-to-back defeats against Tottenham and Brighton plunged a new-look Manchester City and their manager into clear crisis territory.",
      "They’ve since escaped that talk for now by not losing any more games, and winning most of them thanks to Erling Haaland scoring quite simply all the goals. We’ve even seen the team and manager that has won six of the last eight Premier League titles described as ‘dark horses’ to make that seven out of nine, which is quite funny given all the information in that sentence and the fact they are currently trailing by three whole points.",
      "Perhaps the speed with which City have proved that all the talk of crisis after a couple of bad results might have been a bit much, and maybe we should learn something from that about the whole idea of deciding who is and isn’t in crisis at such an early stage of the season.",
      "Reader, my friend, we haven’t learned a thing.",
      "",
      "Impressively not in crisis despite losing so much in the summer and taking the high-risk continuity option of entrusting their precious yet deceptively precarious Premier League status to a novice in Keith Andrews.",
      "So far, it’s okay. Better, even. The high points have been very high. Victories over Villa in both league and Carabao, with the best of the lot clearly a thoroughly deserved win over Manchester United. Even managed to get the defeat to Nottingham Forest out of the way early enough for people not to realise how embarrassing that now is.",
      "And, in general, the bad moments – defeats at Fulham and Sunderland as well as Forest have been sufficiently spread out that they don’t command attention. There’s always been another good day round the corner soon enough.",
      "When you’re Brentford, that’s enough. They’re like a Reverse Man United. There, under the spotlight, it takes multiple good results to wash away the effect of the bad, while for Brentford it takes a proper run of bad results for people to forget taking four points off Chelsea and Man United, just as a for instance.",
      "What we still fear is that such a run of bad results really could be just around the corner. It still feels very precarious; they’ve coped admirably with losing the guiding hand of Thomas Frank but it still feels like a club where a minor wobble could become worrying and before you know it, you fear for them, you really do.",
      "December feels like it’s the key month for Brentford given the spread of games they’ve got during that always crucial and busy time. They play Spurs both home and away that month in obviously narrative-heavy games as well as Arsenal away and Bournemouth at home. Throw in a couple of potential six-pointers against Leeds and Wolves and you’ve got the perfect lab conditions for a crisis.",
      "Or you take the optimistic alternative, where the perfect conditions to create a crisis must by definition offer the opportunity to thoroughly dispel the notion altogether.",
      "",
      "A reminder of how restorative a bit of Thursday night Europaball can be for a troubled club. Doesn’t always work and can definitely make things even worse (see Forest, Nottingham) but Villa aren’t the first team who’ve managed to inject a bit of life into a season turning toward the dreary thanks to some Thursday evening respite.",
      "Having failed to win any of their first five Premier League games – failing even to score in the first four of them – and gone out of the Carabao on penalties to Brentford, Villa have now got themselves into a four-match winning run thanks to home league results against Fulham and Burnley to go with a pair of Euro victories.",
      "It’s all feeling much better now than it did a few weeks ago, when it really did feel like we were approaching the end of a bold, often brilliant, but ultimately doomed attempt to re-insert Villa into the elite of English and European football.",
      "We’re still quite a long way from last season’s Icarus-like highs as they soared so close to the sun on wings fashioned from unsustainable wages, but it’s a lot better than it was after failing to hold on to a lead against 10-man Sunderland.",
      "We also very much reserve the right to reassess this reassessing of Villa’s Crisis Levels at the next international break, because they have perhaps the most troubling run of intra-interlull games of anyone. Their four league games in that time are all against teams currently in the top five: Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Already shaping up to be their magnificent scampish big-boy-bothering selves this season. They’ve taken seven points from three games against Man City, Tottenham and Chelsea, and two points from four games against Fulham, Everton, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "That remains in the ‘irritating’ rather than ‘crisis’ territory for now, but isn’t a trend you want to deepen too carelessly in what looks like being a particularly competitive season for those who’ve grown accustomed to easy and comfortable survival in the last couple of straight up, straight down seasons for promoted clubs.",
      "We would very much like to see them continue their policy of winning Carabao games 6-0 away from home when they travel to Arsenal in the next round. Sure, some people might contend that winning 6-0 at Arsenal is harder than doing so at Oxford or Barnsley but as far as we’re concerned that’s loser talk. Aim high, always. Especially when you’re Brighton and as a general rule apparently prefer playing good teams.",
      "",
      "Feels like Leeds were very close to serious crisis levels after botching the last days and hours of the transfer window, leaving themselves pretty short of attacking weaponry and prompting plenty of chat that a decent shot at survival had been squandered.",
      "They’re doing perfectly well, though, and have even started scoring goals. Since being ultimately outclassed at Arsenal – which is fair enough – they’ve been competitive with everyone and while their games against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Spurs may only have yielded two points in total they all showed that Leeds are perfectly capable of mixing it with decent teams.",
      "It certainly doesn’t feel particularly crisis-y right now, even if Bournemouth’s last-gasp equaliser and the lack of reward for a very decent performance against Spurs are a bit annoying.",
      "There is, though, perhaps no club outside the Big Six that faces a more defining period between these two upcoming international breaks. Leeds already occupy an unusual space in that their size as a club doesn’t quite tally with their status as a newly-promoted team, but it’s a fascinating run of games they’ve got coming up over the next five weeks or so.",
      "Before we all take another unwanted rest for the November break, Leeds will face Burnley, West Ham, Brighton and Nottingham Forest. That is a set of fixtures to conjure with. It screams crisitunity. These are all games that should sit pretty high on target fixtures in Leeds’ survival roadmap, given what we’ve seen from all of them so far.",
      "But at the same time three of those games are away from Elland Road. A month from now we could be looking at Leeds sitting loftily and confidently clear of the squabbling and bickering down at the bottom. Or if things haven’t gone quite to plan they could be right in there getting filthy with the rest of them.",
      "",
      "Almost impressive to be a London club and attract as little attention as Fulham. It can work both way but currently means that the only real response to successive 3-1 defeats at Aston Villa and Bournemouth has been to note that Marco Silva looked magnificent standing in the south-coast rain.",
      "No crisis. Might just be the beginnings of one after they’ve played Arsenal and Newcastle, though.",
      "",
      "A keen example of how finely balanced the see-saw can be between crisis and not-crisis. There’s no doubt that, overall, Chelsea’s results have been inadequate given all that talk in the summer – mainly from us, sure – that they ought to be title contenders now.",
      "But also… they absolutely should be title contenders, shouldn’t they? Enzo Maresca can’t keep playing the “Little old us? Title challengers, aw shucks!” when they’ve spent the GDP of a small nation on wingers and Brighton players over the last few years.",
      "Chelsea’s defeats have been eye-catchingly bad. Outclassed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, mugged off again by Brighton late on in the Premier League and – most shaming of all – managing out-stupid Manchester United at Old Trafford. A feat of such crisis-inducing magnitude it’s almost impressive.",
      "They also made uncomfortably hard work of negotiating Lincoln in the Carabao. They also did all those things in the space of four consecutive games.",
      "They are, in short, neither the first nor surely last Big Six club to find themselves grateful that whatever daft things they might be getting up to are being overshadowed to some degree by the dafter things Manchester United are getting up to.",
      "And the response to that run of a win that felt like a defeat and three defeats that felt like… even worse defeats has been undeniably impressive. Survived a meeting with the Special One in the Champions League and then of course lessened their own crisis ratings while deepening Liverpool’s on Saturday evening.",
      "They’ve nudged clear of the deepest crisis alerts but certainly aren’t out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "It is perhaps an indicator of just how low the bar has become for promoted teams now that four points from seven games, with the only win against another promoted club, isn’t drawing more attention towards Scott Parker and his team.",
      "In fairness, it’s also because Burnley did have an undeniably horrible start. Four of those seven games have been against members of the Big Six. And while all have been lost and two of them – against Spurs and City – heavily, there were huge reasons for encouragement amidst the agony of going down to late, late penalties against both Man United and Liverpool.",
      "So no crisis yet, but if they don’t register a win in one of their next two games against Leeds and Wolves it will be an uncomfortably antsy and potentially bottom-three-marooned team that welcomes Arsenal to Turf Moor early next month.",
      "",
      "Looks a lot like a crisis right now, sure, but we’re not worried. Wolves do this a lot. It’s a crisis for Vitor Pereira, definitely, because he might have to be sacrificed, but Wolves making a terrible start to the season and then ending up 14th in May after taking 30 points in the second half of the season and saying ‘What were you worried about?’",
      "They’ll be fine, but Pereira might unfortunately have to play his part by being unceremoniously sacked when they’re six points adrift of safety in mid-December.",
      "Sergio Conceicao, if you’re interested, is our pick as the man to steer Wolves to safety in impressive style, prompting confidence of a much better campaign in 25/26, only to sit 19th after losing eight of their first 10 games and having to be replaced by someone else to continue a perpetual cycle that will outlast us all.",
      "",
      "What a crash course in Barclays that is for Arne Slot, by the way. Hailed as a calm and quiet genius for delivering the title with a settled squad in his first season. Pretty much handed a second title after winning five games on the trot at the start of his second season.",
      "And now, after an admittedly quite ropey fortnight that has seen Liverpool plummet from the very summit of the Premier League all the way down to second place and one whole point behind the new leaders, he is as bald and fraudulent as any Premier League manager has ever been. And those are some high levels of bald fraudulence.",
      "His tactics are being questioned. His selections, his signings – even though they aren’t really his signings – his substitutions. Everything.",
      "The man who delivered only Liverpool’s second league title since the invention of football, and who was pretty much being handed a second by a league apparently collectively bending the knee just two weeks ago, now finds himself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race.",
      "Of course the CRISIS talk around Liverpool is completely insane. But perhaps only Arsenal can rival Liverpool when it comes to a completely unhinged, overwrought and overplayed narrative. The good times are always the very best ever, but that means the lows are met with the same levels of wild overreaction.",
      "Still, though. Definitely feels true that something’s not quite right here, doesn’t it? Definitely not a Liverpool – or Slot – with the same quiet unfussed equilibrium that steered them so calmly through last season. We’re perhaps all already guilty of forgetting both how easily Liverpool won the title and how unexpected that actually was at the start of the season and based on the club’s Premier League history.",
      "They were so good, so quickly under Slot that it became normalised and perhaps even underappreciated.",
      "But that calm authority hasn’t been there this season. There’s been a madcap, desperate nature to Liverpool’s performances that was every bit as much present in their late wins as it has been in their late defeats.",
      "The late goals that have swung so many Liverpool games all bore the Hallmark of Champions™ when going in at the right end, so it’s only fair to ask what they have now they’ve started going in at the other.",
      "Of course, once again, we’re in territory where both are overplayed.",
      "But we nevertheless find ourselves already building up for what suddenly looks like an epic Liverpool-Man United clash on the other side of the international break, one where the loser will be unavoidably and inevitably plunged into a deep and lasting crisis.",
      "Is it accurate, fair, funny or clever to call that game El Crisico? Absolutely not. Is there even the slightest chance that will stop us? Absolutely not.",
      "",
      "Things will, one suspects, eventually calm down a bit under Nuno Espirito Santo but it’s a smaller, quieter, reduced West Ham now, ambition and joy squeezed and squashed into a grim fight for perpetual Premier League survival where there is no greater or larger long-term purpose.",
      "Maybe they’ll have the odd cup run. Maybe another season in Europe here or there. But it all just feels colourless and drab. They’re still in crisis, but it’s a boring and bland crisis. West Ham don’t even get entertaining crises now.",
      "Just all very dispiriting. And worst of all, ceding everything they stand for in the name of drab, colourless survival and the growing apathy of the fans inside their drab, colourless bowl of a stadium might not even work.",
      "The crisis might yet become very colourful indeed.",
      "",
      "You better believe that’s a crisis. It’s been an absolute masterclass in crisis creation, an almost entirely self-created and self-inflicted crisis full of dick-swinging and egos and very stupid men doing very stupid things for very stupid reasons.",
      "Even if you accept the shaky premise that Nuno was developing ideas above his station and getting too argumentative with the all-powerful transfer guru Edu, then deciding to replace him during the season with about the single most philosophically diverging manager imaginable was and remains a choice.",
      "It has now reached a point where sacking that manager after seven winless games might actually be less of a mad piece of behaviour than appointing him in the first place.",
      "And while the sheer speed and scale of the unravelling might be graver than expected, it can’t really be claimed with any real credibility by anyone involved that this sort of outcome was not just possible but probable. Sure, maybe seven months felt more likely than seven weeks, but it just never looked like it could or should work.",
      "If it didn’t work at Spurs with the squad profile they possessed – and in the Premier League, for about a year and a half, it very much did not work – how was it ever going to succeed for Forest’s squad with no time to adapt or adjust.",
      "To their credit, the players really seem to have bought into it. There are no tools being downed here, and it’s further evidence of just how beguiling and inspiring a speaker Ange Postecoglou is. We remain entirely convinced that he can propel people to achieve things they never thought possible. He got Spurs players to win a f*cking trophy, for crying out loud.",
      "But we’re just not at all convinced he can be a consistently successful Premier League football manager, and a club without the insulating protection provided by Big Six status – which still might not have been enough for Spurs in a more routine Premier League season without three catastrophically ill-equipped promoted sides – taking a gamble on him was just thoroughly reckless.",
      "What might save him for a while is a truly joyless and uninspiring list of potential replacements, but that’s of no use to Forest fans right now. Graham Potter being the latest name linked provokes a very different reaction now than it would have a few years ago. Brutal game, football.",
      "",
      "Of course they are in crisis. They have been pretty much permanently in crisis since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and he is, in his own way, one of the men most responsible for the fact that nobody else can match the impossible standards that became the norm across two ludicrous decades.",
      "The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can concoct a plausible answer, is not “Are Man United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, imaginably sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to those outrageous levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the 90s and 00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they just drift further and further from it.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but this continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have managed to win two games in a row at least once is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",

      "If Ruben Amorim was expecting to hear from Sir Jim Ratcliffe during the current international break, he would have feared something rather bleaker than this…",
      "“Ruben is a good guy.” the United part-owner told The Business podcast. “He has not had the best of seasons. But he needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.”",
      "Compared to what Amorim might have expected post-Brentford, that’s a hug and squeeze. But the United boss will recognise lip-service by now. Three weeks, not three years, is the worry that will deprive him of yet more sleep while many of his players are doing their national service.",
      "Amorim is living international break to international break right now. He spared himself prior to the last one with a 97th-minute home win over Burnley in the wake of Grimsby-gate. In this latest three-week audition for his own job, Amorim won two, lost two, the odd signs of encouragement mixed with some familiar failings.",
      "United disproved little of what we already know of them, swaying no-one from the firmly entrenched positions they already held, leaving Amorim and Ratcliffe to kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way a little longer until the one-year anniversary of his appointment draws nearer.",
      "That milestone is more of worry for Amorim than a cause for celebration. Reports suggest United will be liable for a much smaller pay-off if they wait 12 months before sacking another manager. Amid Ratcliffe’s quest to make United the most profitable circus football club in the world, every million quid counts.",
      "For Amorim, there is little respite to be found in the fixture list. Like the last four-game block, United will face two of the big six, Liverpool and Tottenham away, with Brighton at Old Trafford and a possible El Sackico at Forest in between. Three away trips is hardly ideal when United’s form on the road is so poor.",
      "Where is the bar for Amorim? Will six points keep him in a job again?",
      "Liverpool have been poor – are they the crisis club? – but surely not so sloppy as to let United win at Anfield for the first time in almost a decade. As Paul Scholes said, a point would be very nice, ta.",
      "Brighton at home. Sheesh. The Seagulls have had United on strings in recent seasons. The Red Devils might have won their last three at Old Trafford but so have Brighton. United have lost seven of the last eight meetings. Three points will be the expectation of Amorim at the Amex North, but none of us could be surprised if United are left looking to make up points elsewhere.",
      "Maybe at Forest? A year to the day since he was appointed, Amorim will go to the City Ground to face a manager for whom beating United in a European final was not enough to keep his job at Tottenham. Forest, perhaps breezier for also sacking Ange Postecoglou by then, could inflict a third defeat on Amorim on the very day it becomes cheaper to sack him.",
      "Should Amorim reach Tottenham before the next international break, there Ratcliffe could see for himself the positive impact of replacing a dogmatic manager with a pragmatist.",
      "MORE: Man Utd isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "If there is a dour tinge to the context above, that’s because pessimism prevails at Old Trafford these days. That six points might be seen as a creditable haul when This Is Manchester United Football Club We Are Talking About tells its own story. Whether half the available points will be enough to save him once more, only Ratcliffe and his cronies can decide.",
      "Whatever verdict they reach, it ought to be with a view beyond the next convenient sacking window. There are many reasons why the mess United find themselves in is not Amorim’s fault, just as there are plenty that make it true that, so far, he has not done enough to turn the Reds around. Ratcliffe, Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada; if they see a clearer picture than the “knee jerk reactions of journalists who go off on one every week”, then enlighten us and be decisive.",

      "The Spurs striker had quite inevitably scored in the draw with Southampton which triggered Conte’s last, exit-inducing outburst, the captain being rendered collateral damage like everyone else.",
      "It did not exactly come out of nowhere. Conte, as is his eternal legal obligation, had been growing increasingly tetchy over previous weeks. Spurs remained in a theoretical race for Champions League qualification but they limped out of the same competition to AC Milan in the last 16 and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Sheffield United in the build-up to the Southampton game.",
      "They led 3-1 at St Mary’s by the 76th minute but drew after a stunning collapse culminated in James Ward-Prowse scoring a stoppage-time penalty. Their form was disastrous, the relationship was broken and the international break offered a chance to reset.",
      "It also provided an opportunity to appoint Conte’s assistant as his replacement; Cristian Stellini lasted four games as interim manager before himself being shown the door following a 6-1 defeat at Newcastle.

A matter of minutes after conducting post-match media duties having beaten Brentford, the Canaries told the manager that he would be left in the coalmine.",

Norwich were bottom after a run of two draws, three goals scored and eight defeats in their first ten matches; they remained rooted to the foot of the table even after the Brentford win.",
      "But the timing was curious. While the international break was an in-built momentum killer anyway, Norwich seemed desperate to crush even the pretence of an hour’s worth of overdue positivity.",

He remains the only manager to face the same opponent in consecutive Premier League games in the same season, but with different clubs; Norwich beat Saints a fortnight later and Smith went on to force three separate sackings later in the campaign.",

      "It was a warning they failed to heed in the summer, with Gracia authorised to oversee an opening month in which Watford lost three games and drew one before the international break allowed time for pause.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has made a lot of middle-aged white men angry by making a fair point about division in the UK and beyond.",
      "Neville has come in for a lot of stick over the last week with the Daily Mail’s reporting of his comments particularly concerning as they described them as a ‘racist’ outburst.",
      "Despite the former Man Utd and England defender making a wider point condemning “hate speech in any form and abuse in any form” and urging everyone to unite “to get back to a country of love, of peace, of harmony”, they have predictably been dragged out of context in certain quarters.",
      "Here we have put together nine of the best, worst, and honestly most terrifying views on Neville’s comments this week…",
      "",
      "“In his, obviously, isolated world he lives in, he’s in the kind of ivory tower position of being shuttled into a Sky studio, back behind a wall in whatever sprawling estate he’s got, they’re saying he’s worth between £50m and £70m. People are telling me that Overlap earns all them £20,000 a pop, they’re sponsored by ARNE now so surely ARNE’s going to be delighted with Gary saying that because I would imagine their target audience is white, middle-class men. It’s definitely not fella’s called Jihad, white, middle-class men called Jihad. I can’t imagine there being that many of them around.",
      "“But Gary’s got himself into this virtue signalling nonsense. We have this pillock, Neville, and he’s crossed over with me because as I said to him and Rio last night, I’m more than welcome to debate both of you. Let’s roll for two hours, discuss any topic. Gary sat in a room with me when we did The Edge podcast, you don’t need to be scared of me, but intellectually I think you’ve got a lot to answer for here.",
      "“I don’t think Gary Neville has thought about who are his audience. Because I’m looking at it going, you’ve just said people who like the Union Jack, people who are patriotic to show their country’s flag in, in this instance, the country he’s from and represented 85 times at international level…just factor in if he said somebody with brown skin or somebody with black skin, there’d be an absolute outrage about it.”",
      "The delightful Barton added: “People like this, gaslighting you all the time, saying to you: ‘no, no you’re a racist for thinking that. You’re far right for thinking that.’ There’s a synagogue attacked and we get a f*****g d***head footballer, absolute idiot, whose ar**hole is for rent to the highest bidder.",

Why is he belittling his own audience? Why does he not pause to consider that he has strayed so far out of his lane that he is practically in the ditch?

      "And while Amorim’s stubbornness is one of Man Utd’s biggest issues, the weak character of the squad is arguably even more concerning.",
      "Over at the F365 tables, some damning findings can be found on Man Utd’s start to this season.",
      "Firstly, Man Utd are bottom of our second half table, having only picked up four points after the break from their seven games.",
      "It is a different story with the first half table as United are in a far more respectable position of eighth, as all three of their wins this season were earned via their play in the opening 45 minutes.",
      "There is a similar theme with our conceding first table as Man Utd are 19th in those standings, while they are sixth in the table when scoring first.",
      "Also, Man Utd are joint-bottom of the Premier League on points gained from losing positions, with Amorim’s side yet to pick up a single point after going behind this season.",
      "And the main takeaway from these findings is that their glaring weakness is clear: this Man Utd squad has no backbone and their fragile players wilt at the earliest sign of adversity.",
      "This mindset has been an epidemic at Man Utd for years, and it will eventually contribute to Amorim losing his job, as it has with previous post-Sir Alex Ferguson.",

      "READ: Man United isn’t just a CRISIS club – it’s a CRISIS club in CRISIS purgatory with no means of escape",
      "“Yes, he spent a lot of money. I think the forward line has improved. I don’t think there’s any doubt that Cunha is a good player, Mbeumo, and I think Sesko will score goals.",
      "“But if you look at the players in layman’s terms, the players in the Manchester United defence and midfield are not as good as the midfield and defenders [at other big clubs], whether it’s Arsenal, whether it’s Liverpool, whether it’s City, you can argue Spurs and all these teams.",
      "“I think they’ll slightly improve, but I think there has to be an improvement in the quality of players that they’re bringing in. And I also think that it’s not going to be, certainly not going to be an overnight fix.",
      "“I think it’s going to be another two or three windows, and that’s why I’m probably now at the stage, unless results turn dramatically. I think you’ve got to stick by the manager and give them at least another two or three windows.”",
      "Responding to McCoist, Man Utd legend Ferdinand added: “Man United, I think they’ve had the most entries into the opposition box, most chances. I think so they’re getting certain things right.",
      "“But obviously the big, most critical thing is putting a ball in the back of the net. And they haven’t been able to do that. Haven’t been able to do that by hook or by a crook. So is there an element of lacking confidence? Yes, in front of goal.",
      "“Is there an element, maybe needing a little bit of luck, like anyone, everyone needs luck sometimes. And if those things start to formulate, then we might start seeing a better, more consistent Manchester United.",
      "“But these are all ifs, buts and maybes. And people ask me: how do you feel about Manchester United right now? I’m in the land of hope more than anything right now, and we need to get most of our fans out of that hopeful thinking. And like I said, results and consistency is going to be the only way.”",

      "But really we love it. We love clicks just as much as Reach do, at the end of the day.",
      "And we therefore will proceed to both have our cake by chuckling at the transparency of the collective media attempt to plunge absolutely every team up to and including Arsenal into crisis (and if you don’t believe us, just a reminder that this was the response to them winning a Champions League game 2-0) just before the barren wasteland of a dreary international break, and also eat said cake by leaning directly into the assorted deliciously stupid and stupidly delicious cracked-badge crisis narratives currently knocking about.",
      "Of course, there will always be those clubs where there is no need for manufactured CRISIS storylines. Those clubs who, out of the sheer kindness of their content-generating hearts, find themselves in some state of actual crisis.",
      "And of those clubs, none has been more reliable over recent years than Manchester United. They are putting our kids through college.",
      "It helps, of course it does, that This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. This is a club that sat astride an entire generation of English football at a specifically crucial period for English football.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson remains, in a twisted way, one of the key villains in the story of where Manchester United now find themselves. Looking back, everything he did just made things impossible for absolutely anyone else who came after him.",
      "He not only set impossibly high standards for an impossibly long and successful time, but in doing so allowed everything else at the club to become lazy and complacent, something most visibly obvious in Old Trafford itself and its continuing damp decay. With Fergie at the helm, United literally could not fail. That final title he won before retirement is an almost sarcastic display of achievement despite a club drifting blithely and obliviously towards disaster.",
      "Ferguson left a United playing staff that absolutely nobody else could succeed with, because he might just be the best football manager of all time and nobody else is that.",
      "Unlike, say, Jurgen Klopp and his succession planning at Liverpool, Ferguson did almost nothing to set the next manager up to succeed beyond declaring poor old David Moyes the Chosen One. Even Ferguson’s continued Old Trafford presence in his retirement years feels like it just makes an impossible job even more impossibly hard for whichever poor bastard is currently attempting it.",
      "And some very good and even great managers have tried and failed to lift this giant club from its post-Ferg funk.",
      "Which all rather leaves us pondering something more existential. The question with United, one that most clubs don’t need to ask but that even those who do can provide a plausible answer, is not “Are United in crisis?” But “How do Man United get out of their crisis?”",
      "We genuinely don’t know what that would even look like any more. A non-crisis Manchester United. Can you even imagine such a thing? They’ve tried new players. They’ve tried new managers. They’ve tried new owners. If anything, it always just somehow gets worse. Despite that often appearing to be literally impossible.",
      "It’s still less than a year, for instance, since Erik Ten Hag’s embarrassing banter reign that was saved by outplaying and beating a peak Man City side to win the FA Cup after an eighth-place finish was seen as the lowest United could possibly, feasibly sink. By the time of his long-inevitable departure it was widely agreed that this was surely United’s nadir.",
      "Roll on 11 months and they’re ‘turning a corner’ by beating Sunderland at home to climb to 10th.",
      "It might be an impossible task to ever get Manchester United back to the absurd levels of dominance and success they enjoyed during the ’90s and ’00s, but with every attempt to relocate that spark they drift further and further from even basic big-club competence.",
      "So you end up with a situation where United become the perfect storm. As the biggest club in the country it already takes far less for them to be in crisis than it does for Joe Mid-Table-Battler or Johnny Yo-Yo-Club, yet they have also contrived to be actually bad enough to constitute crisis at any of those clubs as well.",
      "In essence they are deeper down the crisis well than any other club you care to name, yet because TIMUFCWTA they also have much further to climb to escape it any way. We don’t know what a solution might even look like.",
      "But what we can say with some confidence is that it doesn’t look like Ruben Amorim. We really did think it might for a while there. He has the requisite charm and charisma to pull off the performance aspect of being Manchester United Manager. But while you can’t succeed in this job without that, it still isn’t enough on its own.",
      "Because, again, his record isn’t just ‘Bad for Manchester United’ bad; it’s ‘Bad for any Premier League club’ bad. It is relegation-form bad. The only other Premier League clubs with records anywhere near as bad as Amorim’s since he took over have all changed managers because of it, including one who did so out of sheer embarrassment at only beating United 1-0 in a European final.",
      "It’s far more symptom than cause of Manchester United’s ongoing crisis status, but the continued inability to string two wins together is a great bit. It was a running joke during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s time that every month or so United would turn a corner down yet another cul-de-sac, but Amorim has perfected it.",
      "The list of terrible Premier League managers who have at least managed to win two games in a row is a hilarious one, and the fact Amorim talked openly about it before the botched chance at Brentford is revealing in itself.",
      "While the record is specifically around league games, it also highlights just how damaging United’s failure to a) qualify for Europe and then b) avoid total Carabao catastrophe at Grimsby has been.",
      "Because their near total lack of midweek football just gives no chance for any forward momentum to develop while allowing whatever the latest setback might be to moulder and fester for an entire week. United are definitely in their own heads to an uncomfortable degree on this ‘two wins’ thing.",
      "And it also means less chance of some easier games to help things along. You only have to look at Villa right now to see how even a bit of gentle Thursday night Euroball can help change the mood.",
      "United don’t have that option. They don’t have any option. For this once-mighty club, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no end to the tunnel.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United remains precarious and there have been no shortage of potential candidates to take over.",
      "‘The last thing Thomas Tuchel wants is for outsiders to stir up tensions,’ writes a man doing exactly that with Jude Bellingham.",
      "Gary Neville’s comments have inevitably brought division to a Mailbox that includes talk of ‘delusion’ among us ‘sissy left-wing’ types.",
      "It is certainly crisis (CRISIS) season in the Premier League. That’s not our fault. Nothing we can do about that except rank them.",

      "The Red Devils spent around £200m on attackers in the summer transfer window with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving.",

      "Gary Neville likely knew the reaction his comments would evoke, but did he know the furore ‘won’t stop until he’s taken off Sky and his Overlap podcast’?",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Ah yes. When it’s saying the most hateful, racist and bigoted stuff about minorities such as black people, immigrants and trans women it’s just free speech but when it’s mean comments about white people and men it’s OH MY GOD THIS IS AN OUTRAGE THIS BIGOT SHOULD BE SACKED NOW!",

      "These are the same people – Oliver Brown chief among them – who went after Gary Lineker for years, stamping their feet and having tantrums until they finally got what they wanted.",
      "The nature of these people is such that they always have to have some fresh meat to satisfy their bloodlust. They are truly warped and damaged individuals who either genuinely believe in the ill informed weapons-grade bollocks they spout, or worse, they spout it because they don’t want to upset the people who write their pay cheques.",
      "Like Lineker, Neville has a big platform. He has millions of people who listen to his views on a variety of topics. Some of those views terrify these people because the old media ecosystems of a select number of newspapers and 5 TV channels died a long time ago. Whereas back in the day they could just isolate anyone with a centre or centre left view, they can’t anymore. Social media scares them because they can’t control it. It’s sheer terror, raging against the dying of the light.",
      "If Neville posted a video from his back garden erecting a flag of Yaxley-Lennon’s boat race on a pole, they’d be lauding him as a man of the people, a good old sort. But speak a few home truths they don’t like? Then look out.",

      "Good mail from Dave in Manchester. Likewise, I wasn’t expecting anything great this season. However, the one thing I was hoping for was the beginnings of a side to build at least the next few years around. One involving Mainoo, Heaven, Yoro, Fredricson, Collyer, Amad, Amass – maybe even some of the next generation – with players like De Ligt, Bruno, Mount and Mazraoui to keep up quality, plus Dorgu and whoever we had as striker.",
      "Sadly, instead of trust in and development of youth, they’ve been used as a scapegoat while the core of the team is the oldest and worst, the players we cannot get rid of – players far worse than the “bomb squad”; the likes of Dalot, Shaw, Casemiro, Maguire.",
      "I don’t care who the manager is, whether they smile in press conferences or what system they play. I don’t even mind a few losses on the journey, but what I do care about is building a side for the future, and that work has to start now.",
      "Continuing to pick Bruno at CM is misguided at best, but a central partnership with Casemiro rather than letting Mainoo, Ugarte or Collyer develop into the role is the definition of short-term thinking and a suicide note and should be considered as much.",

      "So I keep hearing how other clubs need to click. Man City are transitioning. When Liverpool’s attack clicks, the league will feel it. So Arsenal’s attack will not click? or Chelsea’s attack? Basically, if you look at Man City 1st XI, basically the same team, bar Tejinders and Donnarumma. When you look at Liverpool’s 1st XI, same team, bar Wirtz, Isak, and Kerkez (I do not rate Frimpong, because whoever decided to buy a wing back who can’t cross or defend as a full back should be queried), and if you look at Arsenal’s 1st XI, basically the same team bar Zubimendi, Gyokeres, and Eze.",
      "One of the managers has never won a league title, but I hear stuff like when Liverpool attack clicks, Man City are transitioning, someone even wrote in today, and I quote, “more familiarity in selection. Arsenal got in 8 new players !!!!!!. We need to click too. We need our medical team to sort itself out so we get our players back. We are a work in Progress. Remember, we have never won the league",
      "As an aside, Wirtz was brought in to mitigate Trent’s deep-lying creativity;  most teams will get a deep-lying playmaker. its the logical thing to do as pure No. 10s are a dying breed, but Not Slot, he opted for a No. 10 who played his best and most productive football in his career in a team that had a deep-lying line-breaking playmaker (Xhaka), and did not get any DM with DLP characteristics, although Endo is not really fit for purpose. Secondly, Luiz Diaz left; he was marginally superior to Gakpo. Was he replaced? No. Slot decided Chiesa and Rio will step in, that way Gakpo isn’t challenged anymore, and I remember Elliot coming on for a tired Salah in Paris against PSG, that was also not replaced. I keep wondering why he did not get quality alternatives to his countrymen.",

The initial contact outside the box wasn’t enough… and you should also know, it was Michael Oliver on VAR, so it had to be Stonewall to qualify.",
      "No fuss regarding Paulinha at spurs celebrating a last minute equalizer with his shirty off vs wolves who had lost their first five. If that was an Arsenal player…",

In his humble opinion, after being shown Ickle Mikel’s light bulb speech, he politely eviscerated it (after stifling a chuckle). He cited the example of the All Blacks’ manager being asked if the team talks he used to do were more for himself than the team. The team, when asked whether they were even paying attention, told him they weren’t taking the slightest bit of notice. So they stopped, because the manager had enough humility to do so, and because it wasn’t adding anything to the overall objective: Win (not the dog Mikel).",
      "The underlying theory being that if you need to cosplay David Brent in the moments before the players go out for kick off, then something is wrong in your match prep.

      "Of course pointing at Arsenal when you are dropping points is not the game and that mailbox contributor should wind it in. But I wouldn’t say that you can lose a 5 point lead in gameweek 7. Teams play each other at different times in the season and earn their points at different times. I am of course very much looking forward to playing a promoted team, an Ange Postecoglou team and West Ham at home.",
      "Whilst it is a Rafa fact that Liverpool are playing badly, when did a visit to Stamford Bridge become a 3 point banker? Even if Liverpool were playing very well, there is no reason to expect 3 points from there. Same for Glasner’s Palace away. Galatasaray was what it was. A one nil loss to a weak pen in Turkey in a phase of the Champions League where the prize for coming top of the league is playing PSG. Its just about getting to the next phase. The team with the most points in the group, now league phase, rarely win the tournament.",
      "But Liverpool are playing badly. There’s very little coaching time this time of the season. Its 2 games a week, international break, 2 games a week and now another international week. Although Slot won’t be with his players, hopefully he and his brain trust can work something out otherwise City are starting to look dangerous and we could be looking at third!

      "But it says a lot about how Wirtz has performed for Liverpool to date that he has suddenly dropped from first to sixth in our ranking of the likeliest winners of this accolade in 2025/26.",
      "007 has become 009 as Wirtz, barring the odd flashes of quality, has been ineffective in all of Liverpool’s Premier League and Champions League matches this season, though he has also been impacted by Slot’s side failing to operate as a unit, with players in all positions suffering.",
      "Wirtz will eventually come to life for Liverpool because he’s too good not to, but he already has very little, if any, chance of picking up the PFA Player of the Year award at the end of his debut season at Anfield.",
      "",
      "This season is huge for Arsenal and head coach Mikel Arteta, who have no excuses remaining as they finally look to win big prizes following so many near misses in recent seasons.",
      "After spending around £250m on summer signings, Arteta arguably has the most complete squad in the Premier League with quality options in every position and were Arsenal to come up short, it has been suggested that their head coach’s overreliance on the handbrake would be their undoing.",
      "This argument was brought up as Arsenal left points on the table against Manchester City and Liverpool, though Arteta has implemented changes to put this right in recent weeks.",
      "Arteta went for the proverbial jugular against Newcastle United and his newfound attacking intent reaped rewards as Arsenal earned a 2-1 comeback away victory, which already feels massive. And there was confirmation of a turning point in their next game as he experimented with Eberechi Eze and Martin Odegaard in an exciting midfield three alongside Declan Rice against West Ham.",
      "So, for now at least, Arteta appears to have binned his handbrake as recent victories have given him the blueprint on how to overcome the low block and win while chasing a game, which could be pivotal in this season’s title race.",

      "Everyone associated with Liverpool and Arsenal would have let out an audible gulp when Man City hammered Wolves 4-0 away on the opening weekend via a brace from Erling Haaland and goals from summer signings Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki.",
      "However, those same individuals breathed a sigh of relief as Man City followed this big win up with back-to-back losses against Spurs and Brighton, suggesting that Pep Guardiola’s winning machine may not be fully fixed after all.",
      "Man City are certainly in a better position than last season as Phil Foden’s return to form and Gianluigi Donnarumma’s great start have been huge positives, while Haaland has taken his goalscoring and overall game to extraordinary new heights.",
      "Still, this Man City squad is a far cry from the champions of years gone by, with their fragility proven by their opponents’ lack of fear when facing Guardiola’s side who, even with Donnarumma in goal, look shaky at the back and are struggling to put teams away. They will be fine for the top four again, but it’s too soon in their rebuild phase to seriously challenge Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s Club World Cup final win over Paris-Saint Germain felt like a coming-out party for Enzo Maresca’s side after they showed great resilience to finish in the top four and win the Europa Conference League to take pressure off of the head coach.",
      "And some argued that their Club World Cup triumph would propel them to being credible Premier League title challengers this season and winners in the next couple of years, but their start to this campaign has indicated that they are in a similar position to 2024/25 and how swiftly an outlook for a manager can change.",
      "The Maresca sack hype picked up last month as Chelsea lost three games in five and their only win was against League One side Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The pressure on Maresca has eased following much-needed wins over Benfica and Liverpool, though Chelsea are lacking a top-quality goalkeeper and centre-back required to take them to the next level.",
      "",
      "“I can only congratulate them in Stuttgart for finding, so to speak, an idiot who would pay that much money, because we certainly wouldn’t have done that.”",
      "Former Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge exemplified the clear bitterness of the Bundesliga champions with this childish dig at Newcastle United over paying £69m to sign Woltemade.",
      "Yes, Newcastle’s desperation to land a suitable replacement for Alexander Isak was exploited by Stuttgart as the Premier League side overpaid to sign Woltemade, who headed to England relatively unproven after only one good season in the German top flight.",
      "But Woltemade sparkled at the summer’s U21 European Championships and has expertly handled the immense pressure of succeeding Isak, with the confidence boost of a debut goal certainly helping his cause.",
      "The 23-year-old has a credible case to be one of the signings of the summer after scoring four goals in his opening seven games, especially considering the pressure he’s under amid the absence of fellow arrival Yoane Wissa. Rummenigge is actually the “idiot”…",
      "",
      "There was a ridiculous early-season clamour for Emery to be sacked by Aston Villa amid their alarming start to this campaign.",
      "In hindsight, everyone should have seen this coming following their failure to secure Champions League qualification, limited transfer activity and speculation surrounding the futures of several key players.",
      "The Premier League’s PSR rules have stuffed Aston Villa more than most, with these factors contributing to Villa finding themselves in the Premier League relegation zone at the start of this season.",
      "The loss of form of Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins has made Aston Villa goal-shy, but Emery has found some answers as they have dug deep to climb out of the mire with four consecutive wins in all competitions.",
      "Villa still have their issues with a squad of lesser quality than last season and they will likely struggle to replicate their 2024/25 sixth-place finish, but Emery remains the most important person at Villa and it was daft for anyone to think that they would be better off without him.",
      "",
      "By signing up-and-coming forward Sesko instead of a proven upgrade, e.g. Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen, to solve their striker problem, Man Utd ran the risk of landing another Hojlund.",
      "In his first season at Old Trafford, Hojlund proved his worth by netting a respectable tally of 16 goals in all competitions, but his second year was a completely different story as he lost all of his confidence and was a shell of his best self.",
      "So it was understandable that United felt he needed to be offloaded and replaced in the summer, with INEOS eventually settling on Sesko, a similar profile of striker, to succeed the Napoli newbie at Old Trafford.",
      "As expected, Sesko immediately came under scrutiny at Man Utd and was quickly written off amid his slow start, but he’s gradually found his feet by scoring in his last two Premier League games. Hojlund, meanwhile, has been a revelation at Napoli, netting four goals in six games, to make a permanent transfer “almost guaranteed”.",
      "The respective performances of these strikers in recent weeks suggest that they have the tools to succeed at Man Utd, though that is heavily dependent on the service provided to them; Sesko is currently dealing with this better than Hojlund did.",

      "Helped by the goalscoring of fit-again Igor Thiago and inspired summer signing Jordan Henderson, Brentford have moved out of the bottom three via Andrews schooling Ruben Amorim and beating Aston Villa.",
      "Brentford still are expected to be in the bottom six this season as they have a weaker squad than recent years, but Andrews is quickly proving himself to be capable of the head coach’s role and it would not be a shock at all if he guides them to survival.",
      "",
      "The fight at the bottom is certainly more interesting than it’s been in recent seasons and this is largely thanks to the promoted sides recruiting well and making necessary tactical tweaks to make them more competitive at this level.",
      "Sunderland have been a breath of fresh air under Regis Le Bris and certainly look the most likely of the promoted teams to survive, while Leeds United, despite their lack of bite in attack, have shored up defensively to give themselves a strong platform to secure positive results.",
      "Burnley also acquitted themselves well in their opening couple of matches, but it has been more of the same since the end of August, with Scott Parker’s side only picking up a single point since their sole Premier League win of the campaign against Sunderland.",
      "This already leaves the Clarets in the bottom three and it’s difficult to see a significant improvement en route to another relegation without a scrap due to their newfound defensive frailties and their attack being even worse than it seems as they overperform their xG.",

      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",

      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim is under pressure after a mixed start to the season followed last term's 15th-placed finish; Man Utd's minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has given him a huge vote of support: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years.\"",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",
      "Asked if Amorim is going to get three years, Ratcliffe replied: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.",
      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",
      "United's director of football Jason Wilcox has canvassed the opinion of some of the United players - as he would in normal conversations around the training ground - and the consensus is that the squad are happy with Amorim.",
      "Of course, there is empathy and understanding that perhaps the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, for example, may not be fully content with the lack of game time they have had so far this season.",
      "But, for the most part, it seems clear, as of now, that the Portuguese has the backing of the group - some of whom, most notably Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount, have said so publicly in recent interviews.",
      "\"We all know how football works. Before the next international break, Man Utd have got four games, Liverpool, Brighton, Forest and Spurs.",
      "\"What happens if they lose all those games? There will be another international break. Everybody will be talking about Ruben Amorim's future again.",
      "\"This is a very significant intervention by Jim Ratcliffe to come out and back Ruben Amorim. I personally think the backing is not 100 per cent. If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",
      "\"He's just saying 'Ruben needs to demonstrate he's a great coach over three years'. 'We have to be patient'. 'We have a long-term plan'. 'It isn't a light switch'.",
      "\"It's not a light switch, but Manchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world. I would say the only clubs that really compare to them on a worldwide basis are Real Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "\"What would journalists in Spain who cover Real Madrid or Barcelona be saying if Real Madrid finished 15th in the table? What would they be saying if their new manager was bottom of the table when it came to results since he'd taken over?\"",

      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",

      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",

      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
