      "Michael Carrick worked with Jonathan Woodgate at Middlesbrough(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick is keen to bring in Jonathan Woodgate as part of his coaching staff at Manchester United ahead of his interim spell at Old Trafford - which is set to be announced.",
      "Carrick has beaten Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the race to lead the Red Devils for the remainder of the season and is already thinking about who could assist him. Ex-Leeds player Woodgate is among those on his radar, having worked with him previously.",
      "There could be coaching role for Darren Fletcher after he took charge of the first-team on a caretaker basis for the games against Burnley and Brighton following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. He is already on the club's books and moving him into a different position would be relatively simple.",
      "Woodgate played alongside United's sporting director Jason Wilcox at Elland Road during the early 2000s before the defender moved to Newcastle. Following his retirement the England international would take charge of Middlesbrough for several years and was later handed the main job at Bournemouth.",
      "Whilst on the south coast he led the Cherries to the play-offs, but lost in the semi-final to Brentford. He would return to Middlesbrough when Carrick was named as manager, working under him, but left upon his sacking and has been out of work since.",
      "Woodgate would buck the trend of former United players working on the staff. For years the club has continued to turn to those who played at Old Trafford, the majority of them under Sir Alex Ferguson. That is a method that has drawn mixed reviews but Woodgate would be able to bring a fresh perspective and wouldn't have the connection to the club's former manager.",
      "Jason Wilcox played with Jonathan Woodgate at Leeds(Image: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)",
      "Rooney is another former player to have thrown his hat into the ring with regards to joining Carrick backroom staff, insisting that the club would benefit from having those who've played at Old Trafford on the staff.",
      "“Of course I would (take up a position if asked). I think it’s a no brainer if that’s the situation but I think what the club needs is people around the place. So whether that’s if Michael goes in for instance, Fletch or John O’Shea or myself or whoever it needs people around the club who know the football and Roy Keane, I think.\"",

      "Michael Carrick's qualities left an impression on Bruno Fernandes(Image: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes was confident that Michael Carrick would be a \"really good manager\" if he got the opportunity, despite being angry he was left out of his first Manchester United XI.",
      "The former player turned assistant at Old Trafford has been out of work since being axed by Middlesbrough, but is tipped to take charge at Manchester until the end of the season following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Several of the United stars worked under Carrick when he was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's assistant, and then saw him as the No 1 when he took caretaker charge of the team for three games - winning two and drawing one.",
      "But in his first game, an away tie with Villarreal, he left Fernandes on the bench, instead starting Donny van de Beek. The Portuguese talisman admitted that annoyed him, something he let Carrick know as well: \"I’ve said to him I was really mad to be off on his first game and I tell him now at the end of this game,\" he said at the time.",
      "Despite that, Fernandes was in no doubt that Carrick would go on to become a great manager: \"Honestly for me Michael can be a really good manager in the future if he gets that chance. He knows how to speak, he knows a lot of football. He was one of the great players that not a lot of people talk about. For what I have seen he can be a top coach.\"",
      "Carrick's task would be to achieve a top-four finish and guarantee Champions League football next season for United, who have seen their trophy hopes ended after Brighton knocked them out of the FA Cup on Sunday.",
      "The 44-year-old already has the backing of several senior players, who went to the hierarchy to make it clear that they wanted Carrick - not Solskjaer - to return and lead them for the remainder of the season. Solskjaer had been favourite to replace Amorim, but was ruled out when some players went to club bosses and told them they didn't want him to come back, making it known they had little confidence in him.",
      "Michael Carrick looks to have got the nod ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: PA)",
      "It was also understood that Carrick's personality and coaching qualities impressed senior United's players. Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Fernandes, Amad and Tom Heaton are the only players left at the club who worked under Carrick when he had his brief spell in charge.",
      "United want to make an announcement imminently and the interim boss will be handed a baptism of fire. This weekend United host Manchester City before heading to Arsenal. Taking on the top two in the league will provide a clear sense of where the team are following a troubled period.",

      "While Mather never made a senior appearance for United, he enjoyed loan stints at Rochdale and Tranmere Rovers, and was part of the squad that lifted the FA Youth Cup in 2022.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Mather shared a series of touching photographs documenting his journey at the club, including images of him signing contracts and representing United on the pitch.",
      "In his post, he wrote: \"After 14 years my time at @manutd has come to an end, I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.",

      "Despite missing out on a move last summer, Mather has been involved in first-team training sessions at Carrington this season and has made six appearances in academy matches to keep up his match fitness.",
      "Fellow academy graduate Shea Lacey, who recently made his first-team debut, was among those wishing the winger well. The 18-year-old wrote: \"Good luck my brother all the best.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been linked with a return to Manchester United(Image: Marcin Golba/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed as Manchester United manager in a meeting that lasted just five minutes. In November 2021, a run of poor form to start the 2021/22 campaign culminated in United's 4-1 drubbing at Watford.",
      "The defeat proved fatal for Solskjaer, who knew immediately that he would be sacked, even while the Red Devils were still only 2-0 down at half-time.",
      "Yet, the Norwegian wasn’t officially relieved of his duties until he was called into a meeting by then-executive vice chairman Ed Woodward the following morning. There, the United legend met with Woodward for just five minutes before being sacked.",
      "Solskjaer later told the Stick to Football Podcast: \"At half-time against Watford I knew, that's it. So the team talk at half-time was about, 'Whoever wants to play can play, put your hand up if you don't want to play'. Made a few changes, couple of the lads were actually in tears, and they had a go.",
      "\"Then after the game I knew, but I didn't hear anything. But I still knew. The next morning you get a text: 'I want to see you in my office'. So I knew. I'd just left my missus at the airport and then text her 'I think I'll be coming back with you'.",
      "\"I took about five minutes with Ed [Woodward] and then stayed and spoke to some of the lads and did an interview because I needed to do it properly. I've always seen managers leave it... like two months later they slag someone off... that's not me. I'm like 'No, I want to do it now, tell everyone I'm proud and privileged and move on.'\"",
      "The former Molde boss, who took over United as an interim manager in December 2018 and was appointed as permanent manager three months later, has been linked with the vacant interim position at the club again over the past week.",
      "Following a seven month tenure at Besiktas last year, the 52-year-old was one of the potential managers who met United’s director of football Jason Wilcox over the past few days as the latter looked to appoint a successor to Ruben Amorim, who was sacked on January 6.",
      "Michael Carrick is set to be appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Both Solskjaer and fellow United legend Michael Carrick pitched for the job, though Carrick was deemed particularly impressive thanks to his plans and has seemingly won the race, according to reports.",

      "Chido Obi hasn't played a minute for Manchester United since last season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Chido Obi has made a statement to incoming Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick by scoring his first goals of 2026 in the Under-21s' 4-1 victory over Wolves. The striker has not featured for the first team since last season after being overlooked under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward doubled United's lead in the second half after Tyrell Malacia had put them in front. His first goal was a close-range effort, followed by a composed finish inside the box to make it 4-1.",
      "Obi has now netted five times in nine Premier League 2 matches this season. His brace against Telford marked his first league goals since he scored in a 2-1 win over Liverpool at the end of September.",
      "Despite shining in the academy since his move from Arsenal, the 18-year-old has only been included in one first-team squad this season. Obi was an unused substitute in the 1-1 Premier League draw with Wolves under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Last season, the striker featured eight times for United, with seven of those appearances coming in the Premier League. However, an early Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town in August has limited his opportunities this term.",
      "With Amorim now gone and Carrick set to take over, Obi has sent a timely reminder of his abilities. Calls for Obi to be promoted to the first team have been growing among fans throughout the first half of the season.",
      "Chido Obi has scored five Premier League 2 goals in nine appearances this season(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "United's Under-21s are currently leading Premier League 2 after winning eight of their first nine games. However, with Benjamin Sesko's slow start at Old Trafford and Joshua Zirkzee's uncertain future, Obi could find himself with a chance under Carrick.",
      "Earlier this season, former United manager Amorim faced backlash over his comments regarding the club's youth academy. The Portuguese boss hinted at a sense of entitlement within United when questioned about his reluctance to give Kobbie Mainoo more playing time.",
      "\"I think it's the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" Amorim said in his press conference ahead of Man Utd's trip to Aston Villa in December. \"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "Michael Carrick is set to become Manchester United's interim head coach(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"You guys talk about players who speak against clubs because they feel entitlement, then you have legends say if you don't play, leave because everyone is wrong. No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "He continued: \"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match. [Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in the U21s.",
      "\"All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Both Obi and Amass responded to Amorim's remarks by posting images on their Instagram profiles, which were later removed. Amass uploaded a snap of himself holding Sheffield Wednesday's Player of the Match trophy, whilst Obi's showed him celebrating a strike for the Under-21s.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The head coach job at Manchester United has been something of a poisoned chalice since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. The Red Devils have gone through 11 managers, including caretaker and interim posts, since 2013 without a Premier League or Champions League title even coming close to an Old Trafford return.",
      "With the sacking of Ruben Amorim, the English giants are pressing restart (again) on their project to success but it's one that must begin with the appointment of a permanent head coach.",
      "There have been several individuals linked with the job, such as Gareth Southgate, Graham Potter and Thomas Tuchel but there's only one man who fits the criteria perfectly. Well, according to AI that is.",
      "We asked AI for their recommendation on who should follow in Amorim's footsteps in their attempt to awaken the sleeping giants and the answer it spat out was Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann.",
      "Putting aside AI for a second, the 38-year-old has already earned high praise from his compatriot Jurgen Klopp who once described him as a \"big coaching talent\". It was before the two managers were to go toe-to-toe in 2017 with Klopp's Liverpool taking on Nagelsmann's Hoffenheim in the Champions League playoffs.",
      "Just 29 years old at the time, Nagelsmann was tipped for big things by Klopp who said: \"I'm really happy for my friend and agent because I'm the old horse in the stable and there's a young horse already!",
      "\"He's a big, big coaching talent. We don't know each other very well but I've followed his way because I like good football. He's not the only one but he's a good example of a lot of really good young managers in Germany.",
      "Jurgen Klopp previously described Julian Nagelsmann as a 'big coaching talent'(Image: )",
      "Returning to AI's explanation of why Nagelsmann ranks top of any other managerial candidate for United, his experience at another football giant in Bayern Munich means he's equipped to deal with big egos and expectations.",
      "However, his contract with Germany which lasts until UEFA Euro 2028 could prove to be a sticking point. Nagelsmann previously led Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig and it was his time with the former that illustrated his ability to build a team.",
      "Hoffenheim were 17th in the Bundesliga at the time of his appointment in February 2016 but avoided relegation under the German who only a year later clinched Champions League qualification for the first time in the club's history.",
      "Given United's current circumstances, they are certainly in need of a manager who can, with time, create a team capable of securing European football and flourishing in it, as proven with his run to the Champions League semi-finals with Leipzig.",
      "The 38-year-old recently extended his contract with Germany until Euro 2028(Image: )",
      "Amorim's stubbornness with his three at the back formation was a continuous sticking point throughout his 14-month run at Old Trafford but Nagelsmann won't be plagued by the same issue because of his tactical flexibility, according to AI.",
      "Capable of setting up teams that can play a back three or four, the German will be able to adapt to the players he has rather than exposing his squad by playing a system they're not equipped to succeed in.",
      "Whether United's hierarchy decide to target Nagelsmann remains to be seen but the German seems like the perfect option to rejuvenate the club from yet another managerial departure. Once again, according to AI.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly set to announce Michael Carrick as their new interim manager on Tuesday. The 44-year-old has been in discussions with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, over the past week and it's now believed that he will be leading the Red Devils until the end of the season.",
      "As per The Guardian, the official announcement of Carrick's appointment is due on Tuesday. Darren Fletcher, who has overseen two matches since Ruben Amorim's dismissal last Monday, is expected to join the coaching team.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate, the former Real Madrid defender and first-team coach at Boro for three years, is also being considered for Carrick's staff. Carrick is set to conduct his first training session on Wednesday when the squad returns from a two-day break.",
      "His immediate task will be to ready his team for Saturday's clash against Manchester City. United are likely to provide Carrick with funds for the January transfer window, with midfield identified as an area needing reinforcement.",
      "Al-Hilal's Ruben Neves, formerly of Wolves and Porto, has emerged as a potential target for the Reds, with an estimated value of around £20million. Neves, 28, netted Al-Hilal's third goal in their victory over Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League on Monday.",
      "With his contract at the Middle Eastern club set to expire this summer, United could potentially snap him up for a bargain, as per the report. Carrick took the reins at United for three games as caretaker manager in November and December 2021 following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal.",
      "Ruben Neves has been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "He remained undefeated during his brief tenure, guiding the team to a 2-0 Champions League win against Villarreal, a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League, and a 3-2 league triumph over Arsenal at Old Trafford. The former United and England midfielder left when Ralf Rangnick was appointed as interim manager until the end of the campaign.",
      "Carrick then took over as Middlesbrough's manager in October 2022 and spent nearly three years at the Riverside Stadium, securing 63 wins and 24 draws from his 136 matches in charge. During his playing days at United from 2006 to 2018, Carrick enjoyed a trophy-laden spell, clinching 10 major honours, including five Premier League titles and one Champions League trophy.",
      "United, who were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton on Sunday, are set to face City in the Premier League this weekend before heading to Arsenal and hosting Fulham.",

      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola previously hailed Michael Carrick as one of the best players he’d ever seen as the pair prepare to go head to head as managers. Former Manchester United midfielder Carrick is set to be appointed by the Red Devils on an interim basis following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "He beat fellow ex-United star Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the job. The Norwegian was previously in talks but a host of senior Red Devils stars spoke to United chiefs in an attempt to veto his appointment.",
      "That leaves Carrick as the only real candidate and, should he be appointed as expected, he will lead the club into this weekend’s Manchester derby at Old Trafford. The former Middlesbrough boss will attempt to take on Guardiola, who has previously sung Carrick’s praises.",
      "Speaking during the now 44-year-old’s playing career, the Spaniard said: “I am a big fan of Michael Carrick. He is one of the best holding midfielders I’ve ever seen in my life by far. He’s the level of Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets in Barcelona and Munich.”",
      "Carrick will certainly have a job on his hands this weekend in his debut game. Away from his previous caretaker spell at Old Trafford, he has held just one permanent position at Championship side Middlesbrough.",
      "He spent nearly three years at the Riverside, leading the club to the playoffs in his debut campaign. Middlesbrough also reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals during the 2023/24 campaign but was sacked last summer following a disappointing campaign.",
      "Guardiola, in the meantime, is one of the most decorated managers in world football, having lifted six Premier League titles, the Champions League, two FA Cups and four League Cups during his time at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Guardiola was a big fan of Carrick as a player(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Away from his time with Middlesbrough, this weekend’s clash with City will represent only Carrick’s third Premier League game as a manager. He previously led United in a caretaker spell in 2021 following the sacking of Solskjaer.",
      "He at first secured a 1-1 draw with Chelsea as Jorginho’s penalty cancelled out Jadon Sancho’s opener at Stamford Bridge. Carrick then secured an impressive 3-2 win against Arsenal before handing the reins to Ralf Rangnick.",

      "United legend Solskjaer managed the club from 2018 to 2021, ultimately being let go after winning 54 per cent of his 168 games in charge. Before Carrick's potential appointment, Ronaldo had already praised his former Red Devils' teammate.",

      "Wayne Rooney has thrown his hat in the ring to join Michael Carrick's coaching staff at Manchester United. The Red Devils are poised to appoint Carrick as the club's new interim manager until the summer.",
      "Carrick, 44, first held talks with United board last week following Ruben Amorim's exit, and he has since pulled ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the running to lead the club for the remainder of the season. With Carrick's appointment set to be confirmed on Tuesday, former teammate and United legend Rooney has offered to help the ex-Middlesbrough boss out as part of his backroom team.",
      "Asked if he would join Carrick's coaching staff, he told the BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show: \"Of course I would. It's a no-brainer. I'm not begging a job here by the way. Just so everyone knows, if I was asked to go in of course I would. Appointing the manager is the most important thing.\"",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick were both seen as the leading contenders to lead United until the end of the season, after United made the decision to find an interim before bringing in a permanent replacement for Amorim in the summer. Former United manager Solskjaer had been the clear favourite to take the role and was interviewed twice.",
      "But he was ruled out when some players went to club bosses and told them they didn't want Solskjaer to come back. It's understood the players made it clear they had little confidence in Solskjaer, and wanted Carrick, who has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough last June, to lead them for the remainder of the season.",
      "Rooney believes that Carrick is a \"great fit\" for the role. \"Whether Michael goes in or if that's Fletch [Darren Fletcher] or John O'Shea or myself, it needs people who know the football club,\" said Rooney, who has recently been on holiday with Carrick and his family in Barbados.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick were teammates at Manchester United(Image: John Peters)",
      "\"Roy Keane - I know Roy has had his opinions, I said about Roy going in earlier in the season. Having people who know the club, who care for the club and understand what it takes to be a Manchester United player - that's where the club needs to be.",
      "\"The club has lost its identity, it's lost that family feel, if you like. Whether it's Ole [Ole Gunnar Solskjaer] or Michael, this is an opportunity to bring that back, bring the spirit of Manchester United back to the football club.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher had taken caretaker charge for United's 2-2 draw at Burnley on Wednesday and the 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup to Brighton on Sunday. But he is now set to be replaced by Carrick, with his first game in the dugout coming in the Manchester derby against Manchester City this weekend.",

      "Danny Welbeck once revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson called him following his FA Cup heroics. The former Manchester United forward received a call from his old manager following his role in guiding Brighton to last year's quarter-finals.",
      "It was Welbeck's extra-time strike that secured victory at Newcastle last season, earning Brighton a place in the FA Cup's last eight. He replicated that success by netting the winner in a 2-1 triumph over his old club at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "The 34-year-old broke through United's backline to unleash a ferocious finish into the top corner past Senne Lammens. And whilst Benjamin Sesko maintained his recent scoring streak with a late consolation, Welbeck and Brighton came out on top.",
      "Ferguson, 84, may be less enthusiastic about congratulating his former striker after knocking his cherished United out of the competition. Nevertheless, he has previously demonstrated considerable backing for Welbeck, having handed the forward his senior debut aged just 17.",
      "\"After the Newcastle goal, I think he [Ferguson] was away in South Africa, and he rang me and he was talking about the goal and the performance,\" Welbeck told BBC Sport last year. \"It's 'No caller ID' that always rings, and I was just like, 'Hello?'",
      "\"Sometimes I don't even answer as I don't know who it's going to be, but it was him and he was just buzzing. To have that connection...he's a manager who was always looking out for his players, always wants the best for them, and still to this day we're still in contact.\"",
      "The warmth Welbeck feels towards the boss who gave him his chance at such a young age is evident. The 42-times capped England star lifted the League Cup and FIFA Club World Cup during his debut season as a first-team player before being loaned out by United.",
      "For a brief while, Welbeck appeared destined to become United's star striker for years to come. He notched a personal-best tally of 12 goals across 39 matches for United throughout the 2011/12 season, Ferguson's second-to-last campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "He also secured his sole Premier League title in 2013 as Ferguson himself departed United. Yet despite subsequent moves to Arsenal, Watford and ultimately Brighton, Welbeck's occasional communication with such an influential figure hasn't weakened their bond whatsoever.",
      "The defeat at home to the Seagulls marked the end of United's four-match unbeaten streak. And it may prove to be Darren Fletcher's last match as caretaker manager, with Michael Carrick set to take over as interim boss.",
      "Senne Lammens had little chance of stopping Welbeck's winning strike on Sunday(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Welbeck's winning goal serves as another stark reminder of the success that former United players often find after leaving the club. While that's not to suggest that Welbeck would be a better fit for the current side, it's worth noting his nine goals this season surpass any tally from a United player so far this term.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is currently leading the squad with seven goals in 16 matches across all competitions this season. The forward has been away at the Africa Cup of Nations but is set to return following Cameroon's exit from the tournament in what could be a much-needed boost.",

The 19-year-old striker made a big impact at the Cobblers, scoring three goals and providing four assists in 25 appearances during the first half of the season.",
      "BBC Sport has reported that there's considerable interest in the young forward from other clubs. Given Northampton's current position - fifth from bottom in League One - it seems likely that Wheatley could be headed for a club higher up the league ladder.",
      "However, any potential move may be delayed due to an injury he sustained in a match against Huddersfield in late December. Despite missing the last two league games, he was a regular starter for Northampton, leaving head coach Kevin Nolan both 'disappointed but proud' following United's decision to cut short his loan stint.",
      "Nolan said: \"We are disappointed Ethan has been recalled but we are proud of the work we have done with him and believe he leaves us a far better player than he arrived.",

      "\"I'd also like to thank the supporters for their backing home and away who have been superb this season. It has also been a pleasure sharing the dressing room with a great group of lads and I wish the club and everyone connected with it all the very best for the future.\"",
      "Wheatley's departure is unlikely to be the sole major decision or announcement made this week, with United anticipated to shortly name a new caretaker manager until the end of the campaign. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have emerged as the two remaining candidates, with United having held direct talks with both last week, according to the Guardian.",
      "Carrick is set to be appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick appears to be the former United favourite who has edged ahead in the running, with some senior squad members reportedly expressing reservations about the prospect of Solskjaer returning for a second stint. Darren Fletcher has occupied the dugout for United's previous two matches since Ruben Amorim's dismissal and was questioned about his own immediate prospects following the loss to Brighton.",

      "That could open the door for United to stake their claim on the player. They may have to agree to those terms or kick up an increased figure up front in order to do so, but the main positive is the door isn't completely shut just yet.",
      "Gallagher, 25, could still represent a significant bargain at £35m in today's market and would address a big need in midfield. Kobbie Mainoo is still hoping to make his way back into the team after being an outcast under Amorim, while Manuel Ugarte is being linked with an Old Trafford exit.",
      "There's also the looming threat that captain Bruno Fernandes could leave in the near future following back-to-back windows being targeted by clubs in Saudi Arabia. However, Villa have the allure of Champions League football and are in the conversation for a Premier League title challenge, something United can only dream of at present.",
      "One name who's certainly on his way to Carrington is Ethan Wheatley. At least for the time being, that is, after United cut short the forward's loan spell at Northampton Town.",
      "England under-20 international Ethan Wheatley has been recalled from his loan at Northampton Town(Image: Cat Goryn/Shutterstock)",
      "It isn't believed the decision is anything but tactical on United's part as they look to give the 19-year-old the best possible opportunity to thrive. And it's clear Wheatley was admired at Sixfields after Cobblers boss Kevin Nolan described his disappointment with United's manoeuvre.",
      "\"We are disappointed Ethan has been recalled but we are proud of the work we have done with him and believe he leaves us a far better player than he arrived,\" said the Bolton legend. \"We thank Manchester United for loaning Ethan to us and wish him well for his future career.\"",
      "United routinely include break clauses in the contracts of their young players for precisely this reason. And rather than see the player continue in League One, they may now target an opportunity for the striker at a higher standard.",
      "Wheatley, who signed a new deal at United last year, scored three goals and recorded four assists in 25 appearances for Northampton across all competitions. Stephen Torpey is currently overseeing loans at Carrington after Jonny Evans, who is currently serving on Darren Fletcher's backroom staff, left his role as head of loans and pathways.",

      "Man Utd's hopes of winning silverware are already over(Image: )",
      "Manchester United's season is in the gutter. Joining the club's once great reputation. A campaign so embarrassing United are setting records which haven't been broken since World War II.",
      "You have to go back that long to find the last time United had no silverware to compete for at this stage of a season. No FA Cup. No Carabao Cup and no European competition to even begin with. And no chance of United winning the title. Do me a favour.",
      "United haven't come close to winning the biggest domestic prize in more than a decade. Liverpool went 30 years without winning a title - and who would bet against United going on to emulate their bitter rivals? The best United can now hope for is to squeeze and squirm into the European places.",
      "That's how bad its got. One of the supposed biggest clubs on the planet, scavenging for scraps from the rubbish it has overwhelmed by. United have become a parody. A laughing stock of epic proportions. A bang average team with no permanent manager.",
      "One about to welcome another interim one, the sixth of this kind since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. United have had more caretakers than a school.",
      "If it is to be Michael Carrick, it will be his second stint in this role. He did it before in 2021 after United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who has also been interviewed about coming back for more pain and punishment, from what has now become the impossible job.",
      "United are now rotten from top to bottom. A club owned by two billionaire brothers from Florida, Joel and Avi Glazer, who have somehow managed to oversee years of dereliction and dysfunction, while still making huge profits. And another bloke, in the shape of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has been woefully exposed as incapable of co-owning a business like United.",
      "Ratcliffe used to have the Midas touch in other fields. But when it comes to this footballing monster from the red half of Manchester, whatever Ratcliffe touches turns to the brown stuff. United are trapped in a crippling cocoon of serious mediocrity. Stuck in the past, which is depriving them of a future.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has got a number of his big decisions wrong(Image: Getty Images)",
      "A club which has drowned in its own shameless obsession with arrogance and entitlement. The English giants used to rule Europe and dominate domestic football. Other clubs lived in fear of facing them. But fast forward to 2026, and rival teams cannot wait for the chance to rub United's noses in the dirt again.",
      "A team which can't even beat Grimsby Town. A club which now has a captain, in Bruno Fernandes, who cannot wait to leave. He's had enough. While the climate is so humiliating, the squad will once again be cancelling the end of season prize-giving night.",
      "What's the point in staging such an occasion, when no-one is deserving of an award? People used to raise glasses to United to toast their relentless success. But these days there isn't enough alcohol on the planet for those associated with them to be able to suitably drown their sorrows. From a football club to a comedy club - but no-one inside United is laughing.",

      "Michael Carrick looks set to be the man to take the reins at Old Trafford for a second time after the ex-midfielder beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the job as interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "But the Norwegian is now out of contention following talks over the weekend. That has left the door open to Carrick to return to management after being sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer.",
      "It would also signal a return to Old Trafford, having acted as a coach following his retirement, while he was also handed the managerial reins in 2021 for a three-match spell following the exit of Solskjaer.",
      "After the sacking of Solskjaer, United acted quickly in appointing Carrick on a caretaker basis on November 21, 2021. The former midfielder had been a coach under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer.",
      "He enjoyed a dream start, having overseen a 2-0 win against Villarreal in the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo had given United the lead late on, with Jadon Sancho securing victory deep into stoppage time in Spain.",
      "Attention then turned to Carrick’s first league game in charge, with Chelsea his first opponents. Sancho was on the scoresheet once more as he gave United the lead at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Carrick is set to be appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Is Michael Carrick the right man for Manchester United man? Share your thoughts in the comments section",
      "Ahead of Carrick’s third game in charge against Arsenal at Old Trafford, it was announced that he would be stepping down in favour of interim boss Ralf Rangnick after the match. However, his move was not formalised in time, meaning that Carrick remained the decision maker for the clash with Arsenal.",
      "And it produced arguably his most impressive result, with a 3-2 comeback win. Emile Smith Rowe had given the Gunners the lead at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised on the stroke of half time.",
      "Ronaldo then put the hosts ahead shortly after the break, only to see Martin Odegaard level minutes later. United and Ronaldo would not be denied though as he netted once again to secure victory.",
      "Asked what he had learned from his spell in charge, Carrick replied: \"Good question. I think obviously a lot has happened in the last week or 10 days and I've had to certainly adapt and take on a new challenge and some skillsets maybe out of my comfort zone that I've never had to tackle before.",
      "Michael Carrick rounded off his previous caretaker spell with a 3-2 win vs Arsenal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I've enjoyed seeing how I've coped with that at times. You don't know until you're in that situation and you have to learn on the job. I can say, for the most part, I've enjoyed it.\"",
      "He eventually left at the end of his caretaker stint and had 10 months away from football before being appointed by Championship side Middlesbrough. Carrick had just under three years at the Riverside and led the club to the playoffs and a Carabao Cup semi-final spot before being jettisoned in June of this year.",

      "The amateur side from Greater Manchester have captured worldwide attention after assembling a remarkable collection of retired top-flight talent under one roof. Former Manchester City midfielder Stephen Ireland is reportedly instrumental in attracting such a wealth of ex-professionals to the club.",
      "Valencia becomes the latest big name to join, though he wasn't involved in their recent Manchester FA Veterans County Cup triumph. Wythenshawe demolished Reddis North End Veterans 18-0, with 11 of those goals coming after the interval.",
      "The 40-year-old's arrival was revealed on the social media platform TikTok, teasing the Premier League champion's upcoming first appearance. The announcement showcased clips from Valencia's illustrious playing days, accompanied by the message: \"Soon to be running out at the Avensure Community Stadium very soon [fire emoji].\"",
      "Their starting XI reads like a who's who of the football world. It features recognisable names such as Danny Drinkwater, Emile Heskey, George Boyd, Maynor Figueroa, Oumar Niasse and Papiss Cisse.",
      "Before City's 3-0 victory over Liverpool last year, the national press flocked to cover the club's stunning 13-0 demolition of South Liverpool. In a thrilling top-of-the-table showdown, former Newcastle United player Cisse netted seven goals.",
      "Emile Heskey, Maynor Figueroa, Oumar Niasse and Papiss Cisse are among the former Premier League players at Wythenshawe(Image: )",

      "Inclement weather conditions have disrupted their recent fixtures. That has led to the cancellation of their last two league matches against Parklands (Widnes) and Old Strefordians Gregorians in November.",

      "Manchester United have been sent a new Shea Lacey red card verdict(Image: (Martin Rickett/PA Wire))",
      "Manchester United have been informed by a former Premier League official that he would have preferred to see Shea Lacey not shown a red card during the FA Cup clash with Brighton. The 18-year-old was brought on just past the hour mark at Old Trafford, but his appearance was cut short after receiving a second yellow card.",
      "His initial booking came from Simon Hooper after a mistimed tackle on Yasin Ayari, with his second arriving shortly afterwards due to his response to committing another foul. After being penalised, he slammed the ball into the turf, prompting Hooper to brandish the red card.",
      "Multiple opinions have emerged regarding the contentious moment, which left Lacey visibly emotional, whilst interim boss Darren Fletcher was incensed by the decision. Mark Clattenburg, who officiated in the Premier League for 17 years, has now weighed in on the major flashpoint.",
      "Speaking via United in Focus, he said: \"Shea Lacey was sent off against Brighton, not for the tackle, but for his reaction at throwing the ball to the ground in disagreement at Simon Hooper's decision. To the letter of the law, it's the correct decision.",
      "\"But it shows how the game has changed. I would prefer the referee to warn the player to calm down and manage the situation.\"",
      "In the wake of United's most recent disappointment, Fletcher commented: \"True character reveals itself in difficult times. You know in difficult times true character is going to show so they have to dig and make sure they want to be part of Manchester United's future.",
      "\"And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. It sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Addressing the challenges confronting United, Fletcher continued: \"That is where we're at, we can't hide behind that.",
      "\"We've got to face that and we've got to deal with that and it's not Manchester United level or what's expected of Manchester United.",
      "Darren Fletcher was brutally honest in his Manchester United verdict after defeat in the FA Cup to Brighton(Image: Matt West/Shutterstock)",
      "\"The players have to group together, take responsibility. Find a way of improving quickly and taking on the challenge for the rest of the season. Don't waste the season.\"",
      "Fletcher subsequently disclosed he hasn't been informed whether he'll remain in charge for the league encounter against Manchester City, though this appears doubtful given the latest managerial developments.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick were the remaining contenders who could assume temporary control, but it is the latter who appears to have won the race.",
      "As reported by the Guardian, Solskjaer had a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada over the weekend, but it is Carrick who will be installed as the club's new interim boss after some of United's senior players rejected the prospect of former boss Solskjaer returning to the Old Trafford dugout.",

      "\"True character reveals itself in difficult times.\" That was the view of Darren Fletcher, who has already been through one season that ended Manchester United careers and is now involved with another.",
      "The 41-year-old was part of the coaching staff when United fell apart under Ralf Rangnick four years ago and although this squad is clearly more unified than that group, Fletcher accepts it could be another season when some players fail the kind of test that Old Trafford offers.",
      "United have fallen at the first hurdle in both cup competitions and will play just 40 games this season. If Michael Carrick is to take charge for the remainder of the season, he has just 17 games in four-and-a-half months. There will be long gaps between games, but as miserable as everything feels right now, Champions League qualification is still a possibility this season.",
      "Fletcher used his press conference after the defeat to Brighton to lay down that challenge to the players, while making it abundantly clear it is up to them to raise themselves as well. If they fail to do so, then it might spell the end for a few.",
      "\"True character reveals itself in difficult times. We learned a lot about a lot of the players in that situation [in 2021/22],\" said Fletcher. \"That will be the same about these lads now. In difficult times, true character is going to show. So they have to dig in, show they want to be part of Manchester United's future, learn from this.",
      "\"And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. Sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Every player should take that advice on board and deliver a run of performances in training and on the pitch that shows the future can belong to them. If United qualify for the Champions League this season, a campaign in danger of being wasted will be salvaged and the future will look brighter.",
      "Whatever happens, there is a group of players who have probably done enough to be part of the club next season. They include summer signings Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, although Cunha is at a point where he needs to raise his game a level or two.",
      "There are also a group of defenders who will stick around. Leny Yoro hasn't had a great season but faith in his ability to be one of Europe's top centre-backs remains high, while Ayden Heaven is clearly one for the future as well. Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez should be safe.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has been a reliable servant since signing from Bayern Munich and has already shown he has the right character. Luke Shaw is closer to the end than the beginning, but with his contract expiring in 2027, it would make sense to keep him for one more year.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future should be safe now that Ruben Amorim has departed and Bruno Fernandes should clearly stay, although it feels like that decision will come down to what the captain wants. Amad is another whose future is rock solid.",
      "Beyond that, there are question marks everywhere you look. Tom Heaton, Harry Maguire and Casemiro are out of contract. Maguire might yet earn an extension but there's a chance all three depart. Joshua Zirkzee might survive the January window, but he will be off in the summer, and Altay Bayindir is also likely to want a move. Tyrell Malacia's United career has long been over.",
      "Diogo Dalot might consider himself unfortunate to be on the list, but the 26-year-old has had a disappointing season and at some point it feels like there will be an upgrade at right-back. Patrick Dorgu needs to prove he can hit the heights required of a United player, either at left-back or on the wing.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has rarely looked up to the task since moving from Paris St-Germain and needs a big finish to the season. The same could arguably be true for Mason Mount, who has had a better season but still has question marks around his fitness and the level of his contribution. In a year when the midfield is set for a major revamp, the former Chelsea man is vulnerable.",
      "For all of those players, the next few weeks and months will be a litmus test. It is one they need to pass.",

      "Ratcliffe may have to take cover.(Image: )",
      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe secured a minority stake at Manchester United, he stressed his regime would need time to put things right. Everyone knew it would not be a quick fix, but Ratcliffe said that it would be fair to judge him after two or three seasons in charge of football operations.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “So, the message to the fans… I think absolutely our priority with Manchester United is performance on the pitch. So we want Manchester United to be challenging for the Premier League, challenging for the Champions League. That's what Manchester United is about.",
      "“It's the greatest club in the world, so it should be playing the greatest football in the world. But it's not a light switch. We can't just switch a switch and, all of a sudden, United are going to be playing football at the level of Real Madrid because they haven't been for the last 11 years. That takes time and patience.",
      "“The important thing is, I think, that we all observe the trajectory of Manchester United over the next two or three seasons, and the trajectory has to be in a good direction. I think that's how we should be measured.",
      "“I would ask for a bit of patience, but ultimately, you know, the performance of the club does sit on our shoulders. My shoulders particularly, but also Dave Brailsford, who's going to be intimately involved, and the rest of the people at the club obviously. And we need to take the rough with the smooth.",
      "“If we're successful that's fine. I think it would be nice to get a pat on the back for that. But if we're not successful, then it's on our shoulders. So, we fully accept that responsibility and we're going to be very, very focused on doing all the things that we can, as well as we can, to turn Manchester United into a winning side again.\"",
      "The Ineos regime's first big decision ahead of Ratcliffe's first full season as co-owner was to address Erik ten Hag's future. The Dutchman's contract was extended when overwhelming evidence indicated he should have been sacked.",
      "After the Dutchman departed, Ruud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis before Ruben Amorim was appointed. United paid around £11million to release him from his contract at Sporting, but Amorim lasted just 14 months in charge and received a £10m compensation package when he was axed.",
      "Ratcliffe's regime has thrown around millions while hitting fans' pockets.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Dan Ashworth departed shortly after Amorim's appointment. It was said there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen (boardroom)\", and there was an internal clash over Ten Hag's successor. United paid a combined £14.5m to sack Ten Hag, his backroom staff and Ashworth.",
      "Ratcliffe is about to hire another interim coach in his second full season in charge of football operations, with Michael Carrick now the leading candidate to oversee the rest of the campaign.",
      "United exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup at the first opportunity, meaning they will play 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years. The season could become bleak if United fall into the bottom half of the table in the next few weeks and lose pace with the Champions League places.",
      "Ratcliffe oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford in 51 years last term. The British billionaire wanted to be different to the Glazers, but the results on the pitch have actually got worse, not better.",
      "The mess has spread beyond the pitch. Ratcliffe needed to lower the employee count, which was the highest in the Premier League, but the extent of the redundancies was brutal. That was the start of an assault on the club's identity: ticket prices have soared, and the penny pinching has known no bounds.",
      "Ratcliffe axed the annual £40,000 donation to the Association of Former Manchester United Players, which was set up in 1985 to support its 300-plus members, who represented the club in the years before huge wages. Gary Neville sat down with Ratcliffe last year and grilled him on the issue.",
      "He said: \"That’s not the players that played under Sir Alex, or even the last ten years. They’re players from the 60s and 70s. Why not raise the money at a dinner? Give the ex-players their money. It’s a cruel decision.”",
      "Ratcliffe responded \"nobody has suggested that because I would have supported that\", in a comical scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in the political satire British television series 'The Thick of It'.",
      "The truth is Ratcliffe has talked a good game, but he looks out of his depth. The Ineos team was supposed to be 'best in class', yet they have made decisions reminiscent of the previous regime.",
      "Ratcliffe said it was fair to judge him after two seasons. As it happens, those two seasons could be the worst campaigns at Old Trafford for decades. It's little wonder a fresh protest will take place before Fulham.",

      "Both Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have had meetings with chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. Darren Fletcher took charge of yesterday’s 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "Carrick is anticipated to take charge of Saturday's Premier League Manchester derby against Manchester City. However, his appointment won't stop speculation around who will come in as the next permanent boss.",
      "The club are expected to appoint a new head coach on a full-time basis at the end of the season, with several names linked. Luis Enrique and Roberto De Zerbi are two names that have been suggested, with Xabi Alonso now out of work after leaving Real Madrid.",
      "We will have all the latest updates throughout the day, including the appointment of a new manager.",
      "Manchester United youngster Ethan Wheatley has been recalled from Northampton Town. Wheatley signed for Northampton on a season-long loan in August, but United have activated their break clause.",
      "United insert break clauses in the contracts of each academy loanee to provide an opportunity to make a recall in January if required. United have considered Wheatley's loan stint at Northampton as a success, but he has been recalled because the club are seeking an alternative development opportunity.",

      "\"It's a no-brainer. I'm not begging a job here by the way. Just so everyone knows, if I was asked to go in of course I would. Appointing the manager is the most important thing.\"",
      "Man United could hand Michael Carrick his first signing with Ruben Neves, according to The Guardian.",
      "The report states that the midfielder could be available for £20m and there are funds available for Neves to be the first signing for Carrick, who is expected to be appointed as the new interim boss.",
      "Manchester United are expected to confirm the appointment of Michael Carrick as interim manager on Tuesday, according to The Guardian.",
      "The announcement of Carrick's appointment is set for Tuesday and Darren Fletcher, who has taken caretaker charge for two matches since Ruben Amorim's exit, will be offered the chance to be part of the coaching team.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate has also been identified as another potential member of Carrick's staff, with the former Real Madrid defender working as a first-team coach at Boro for three years.",
      "The Times have reported that Xabi Alonso will be of interest to Manchester United for a permanent appointment in the summer.",
      "Alonso was sacked by Real Madrid on Monday after their 3-2 loss to Barcelona in the Supercopa de Espana. With the former Bayer Leverkusen head coach now out of work, he has been linked with taking over at United and the Reds are said to be interested in appointing the Spaniard at the end of the season.",

      "Michael Carrick has impressed Manchester United officials in talks over the interim head coach job(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick has emerged as the leading contender to become Manchester United head coach for the remainder of the season after the former midfielder impressed the club's powerbrokers during face-to-face talks.",
      "United have been leading the search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and have held discussions with Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, while caretaker Darren Fletcher has also been under consideration.",
      "But it is Carrick who looks set to win the race and he could be appointed within the next 48 hours, with United keen to give the new man time to prepare for the derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime. Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are set for more talks on Monday as they aim to finalise an appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked a week ago and Berrada and Wilcox quickly resolved to appoint an interim head coach until the end of the season, while putting Fletcher in charge for games against Burnley and Brighton.",
      "Carrick met Berrada and Wilcox last Thursday and Solskjaer held talks with the duo on Saturday. The Norwegian, who managed United for three years between November 2018 and November 2021, quickly emerged as the favourite and has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August. That seven-month spell in Turkey is his only job since leaving Old Trafford.",
      "It was Carrick who stepped in when Solskjaer was dismissed, leading United for three games before stepping down from a coaching role when Ralf Rangnick was appointed until the end of the season. The 44-year-old former United man oversaw a Champions League win in Villarreal and an Old Trafford success against Arsenal, along with a draw with Chelsea.",
      "He has since had a 136-game stint in charge at Middlesbrough before leaving his role at the Riverside Stadium at the end of the 2024/25 season. He is understood to have impressed during his conversations with Berrada and Wilcox as he laid out his plans for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Fletcher has carried himself well during his spell in charge of the first team, but a draw with Burnley and a defeat to Brighton will have hurt his chances of landing the job until the end of the season. He revealed after the FA Cup defeat to Brighton that he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "\"I have to report tomorrow morning to Carrington. That's all I know. So I'll find out whatever I need to find out tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"I've had zero indication.\"",

      "Carrick is the leading contender for the interim job.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "Four years after stepping down as Manchester United caretaker and declining the chance to coach alongside Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick is preparing for another crack at the job.",
      "Carrick has emerged as the frontrunner for the interim position for the remainder of the season after impressing during his interview. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been in contention for the role and United are expected to formally announce who will assume the position in the next 48 hours.",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, it's hard to believe it's not Scholes,\" was aired at Turf Moor last week. United fans are disillusioned with Ineos' decision-making, and they are set to protest against the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe before facing Fulham, but Carrick is guaranteed to receive strong support from matchgoers.",
      "The former midfielder is hugely popular and only enhanced his reputation during his caretaker stint, in which he oversaw wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw against Chelsea. Rangnick was appointed as interim to oversee the second half of 2021/22, and Carrick declined the opportunity to continue as part of his coaching staff, partly out of loyalty to Solskjaer.",
      "“It is 100% my decision,” Carrick said at the time. “I respect a new manager coming in. I made the decision before speaking to him. It wasn’t an easy one but [it is the] right decision for the club. The loyalty to Ole is a little bit of a factor, but there were a lot of things that came into my decision.",
      "“I was conscious of making my decision before any real conversations with Ralf. It was nothing personal at all. He’s got a good group of players to work with. I’m proud of the players over the past three games. I just told them and they were a bit shocked and surprised, a bit emotional in the changing room.”",
      "Carrick was asked what he would do next. “I can honestly say I’ve given it no thought. Take the kids to school then we’ll see,” he said. “My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career.”",
      "Carrick has unfinished business at United.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "In management, what Carrick did next was take the Middlesbrough job in his native north east. He guided Boro to the play-offs in 2022/23, but was sacked in June 2025 after eighth and tenth place finishes.",
      "Carrick worked with limited resources at Middlesbrough, who have played just one season in the Premier League since their relegation in 2009, and it felt like his tenure had run its course.",
      "There is a feeling that Carrick has unfinished business at Old Trafford. And he should give himself a pat on the back for declining to work with Rangnick in 2021, as he wouldn't have been considered for the job in 2026 if he'd been part of the German's disastrous coaching staff that season.",
      "Carrick decided to walk away from a campaign that was about to unravel with Rangnick in charge. The irony is that he could walk into Carrington with this season threatening to unfold in the same manner.",
      "The 41-year-old's first game if he lands the job will be against Manchester City, followed by a trip to Arsenal. It doesn't get much trickier than playing the Premier League's pacesetters.",
      "United could slip into the bottom half of the table if results don't go their way. They have already exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, and the campaign would become bleak if hopes of securing Champions League football are dashed before mid-February. Carrick will be desperate to make a quick impact.",
      "Carrick dropped Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge.(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",
      "He is a winner and was popular among players during his coaching stint, which should help him. Bruno Fernandes was a close ally and will act as a sounding board if Carrick is formally announced.",
      "The Newcastle-born boss has demonstrated his ability to make big decisions, which is another plus. Carrick had the courage to drop Cristiano Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge in December 2021 and intelligently disarmed the media when he played down the significance of the decision after that game.",
      "\"I didn't see it as being a major decision,\" he said. \"It certainly wasn't within the camp or group. We all got on really well. The game went well to an extent and it wasn't a drama at all.\"",
      "It's those kinds of decisions that a United manager must make with conviction to be successful. Carrick is not afraid to axe players from the team and he should be able to give the current crop a kick up the backside.",
      "United looked like they needed a jolt against Brighton last weekend. Darren Fletcher described the group as \"fragile\", and a club source recently questioned the mentality of those in the dressing room.",
      "Carrick was part of various United dressing rooms over the years with no concerns about mentality. He will need every bit of his coaching experience to secure a spot in the Champions League this season.",

      "Manchester United opted for Michael Carrick as interim manager after some players rejected the idea of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returning to the club, according to reports.",
      "Carrick will assume control until the season's end, marking his second interim tenure in charge. He oversaw the club for three matches in the 2021-22 campaign, winning two games and drawing one.",
      "Solskjaer had been the frontrunner to replace the recently dismissed Ruben Amorim - who was relieved off his duties 24 hours after his explosive press conference which proceeded the 1-1 away draw with Leeds United - and was interviewed twice for the position.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, it's been claimed many of the current crop of players were not enamoured by the idea of the Norwegian taking over again. According to the Mirror, the former United striker was ruled out when certain stars expressed their lack of confidence in him to club officials, stating they did not want Solskjaer back.",
      "Reports understand the players made it clear they preferred Carrick to guide them for the rest of the season. Solskjaer, a United legend, managed the club from 2018 to 2021, before being sacked after winning 54 per cent of his 168 matches in charge.",
      "Carrick's appointment is expected to be confirmed within the next 24 hours, following a process led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "The 44-year-old is anticipated to conduct his first training session on Wednesday, ahead of his inaugural match this weekend when United face local rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford in a crucial encounter. This will be a challenging initiation for Carrick, with United having secured just one victory in their last seven matches across all competitions.",
      "Many United players expressed their doubts about Solskjaer returning, according to reports(Image: OLI SCARFF, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The ex-midfielder was put in charge as interim manager shortly after Solskjaer's dismissal. He secured two victories and one draw in those matches, before departing following the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager.",
      "He has been without a job since being dismissed by Championship side Middlesbrough in June. Carrick guided Boro to the Championship play-offs in the 2022-23 season, only for them to be defeated by Coventry in the semi-finals.",
      "His team then narrowly missed out on the top six in consecutive seasons, leading to Carrick's dismissal. The former England midfielder made 464 appearances for United and clinched 18 major trophies, including the Champions League title in 2008.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June(Image: Neal Simpson/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "He joined Jose Mourinho's coaching team at United after retiring at the conclusion of the 2017-18 season. When Mourinho was sacked, Carrick remained as a first-team coach throughout Solskjaer's 168-game tenure.",
      "Darren Fletcher has managed United in their last two matches following the dismissal of Amorim. The under-18s coach presided over a 2-2 draw with Burnley in the Premier League before Sunday's 2-1 loss to Brighton in the FA Cup third round.",

      "The former United midfielder has emerged as the leading contender to take over at Old Trafford for the remainder of the 2025/26 season. It's understood that Carrick impressed the club hierarchy during face-to-face talks since Ruben Amorim was sacked last week.",
      "Carrick is expected to be appointed this week and take charge of the derby against Manchester City on Saturday. The 44-year-old has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in the summer and is set to oversee a second spell in interim charge after his three-game spell in 2021.",
      "One of the priorities for Carrick when he gets his feet under the table is the possibility of January arrivals. As expected, no talks on potential incoming players have taken place, as the focus is on appointing an interim head coach.",
      "According to The Athletic, United will only be active if long-term targets become available or if they need to prevent other teams from taking pole position to sign a player they are monitoring. There's also the chance that players will be replaced if they leave.",
      "Ruben Neves' contract at Al-Hilal expires in June 2026(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "One target who could be pursued is Ruben Neves. The midfielder has rejected a new contract extension at Al-Hilal, and now that the window is open, he could be made available.",
      "It's believed that the Saudi Pro League side is ready to let Neves leave this month to avoid losing him on a free transfer. The ex-Wolves man moved to Saudi Arabia for £47million in 2023 after being linked with a move to United and Barcelona.",
      "The Guardian have claimed that Neves remains a target in a position they want to strengthen and he would cost just £20m. The report states that if the signing becomes viable, funds will be available to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick is expected to implement a 4-2-3-1 system, similar to the one he enjoyed success with at Middlesbrough. Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are his current options to play in midfield, but question marks over Casemiro and Ugarte mean a new signing isn't out of the question.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's Manchester United future is up in the air for now still(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Mainoo isn't expected to leave the club now Amorim has departed, despite interest from Napoli in Italy. However, the midfield has been an issue at United for a number of years and provided Amorim with some nightmare selection headaches.",
      "Casemiro, whose contract expires at the end of the season, has been better this season than previous years, but Ugarte's time in Manchester has been a struggle. This January, Ajax and Galatasaray are both interested in signing the Uruguay midfielder, less than two years after he joined the club in a deal worth up to £50.5m.",
      "Neves scored a key goal in Al-Hilal's 3-1 win over Al-Nassr on Monday night to move seven points above Cristiano Ronaldo's side. The 28-year-old has scored six goals in 13 Saudi Pro League games this season.",
      "There has been no update on Neves' stance, changing his commitment to Al-Hilal. As the window moves on, the Portugal international is expected to be available and he could be Carrick's perfect welcome gift.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Carrick had featured for United in a loss against Greek side Olympiacos in 2014, and his wife Lisa famously used X to respond to the criticism her husband faced from former United skipper Roy Keane.",
      "\"Roy Keane what a **** says anything to provoke a reaction... That's all... Done...\" she posted, before swiftly removing the tweet and replacing it. She subsequently wrote: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me... Just disappointed.\"",
      "Keane had objected to Carrick's post-match comments about the defeat. Keane had said: \"That interview was just like the performance: flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in his interview. That just reflected United's performance tonight: flat, with no urgency.\"",
      "However, it's now Carrick who has become the frontrunner to take over as United's manager for the rest of the season, after the former midfielder made a positive impression on the club during in-person discussions.",
      "United have been conducting the hunt for Amorim's successor and have spoken with both Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whilst caretaker boss Darren Fletcher has also been in the frame.",

      "Michael Carrick is currently the favourite to take the caretaker role at United, with club chiefs hoping to have a new boss in place when players return to training on Wednesday. What can United fans expect from their former star midfielder should he be the man to get the nod?",
      "His most recent managerial job with Middlesbrough will give fans a decent idea of what's to come from the Englishman, should he be appointed. Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June 2025 after two-and-a-half years in charge.",
      "The ex-England international had guided the club to the Championship play-offs in 2022/2023 but ultimately, his time was up. Teesside Live reporter Craig Johns is someone who can provide an accurate summary of Carrick's time at Riverside Stadium.",
      "Speaking to the MEN, Johns revealed what it was like when Carrick came on board at TS3. \"Boro had a decent squad for the division but sat 21st after a poor start to the campaign under a disillusioned Chris Wilder,\" explained Johns. \"The players were very short on confidence at that time. With that in mind, hiring Carrick felt like a risk.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"There was respect and appreciation for who he is and the playing career he enjoyed. But there was, it’s fair to say, concern that it was a big risk to hire a young coach for his first job when the club were in that position.",
      "\"Nevertheless, Boro fans, like most, will get behind anyone once they’re in post. Away at Wigan, as it became clear he would be getting the job, they were already singing his name.\"",
      "So the early concerns aside, how did Carrick's side actually play football? Amorim stubbornly stuck to his 3-4-3 at Old Trafford, a bold system in modern day football, but Fletcher has reverted back to a flat back four. What could we see from Carrick, should he take on the role?",
      "Michael Carrick could be in the hot seat at Old Trafford(Image: Photo by Matthew Lewis/Getty Images)",
      "\"Carrick played a possession-based style of football,\" continued Johns. \"Which focused on playing out from the back and progressing through the pitch. Generally, it was a 4-2-3-1 formation with the number ten being a link player and the left-sided forward given freedom to roam and float inside, which created space down the left flank for the left-back to get forward. In turn, on the right, the right-sided defender would typically sit and create a back three to guard against transitions.",
      "\"When the quality was there, they were playing with confidence and there was space to exploit, it was a really attractive brand that delivered results and plenty of goals. But at times it was a little too slow and predictable and, towards the end, teams found it too easy to get men behind the ball, limit the space to exploit and frustrate Boro.\"",
      "One of Carrick's strongest areas, according to Johns, was improving individual quality.",
      "\"As for improving players, it was generally one of the better aspects of his time at the club,\" he said. \"He improved numerous players and, certainly in that first season after arriving, his calm and warming demeanor saw players quickly regain their confidence and go on an excellent run from 21st to finishing fourth and making the play-offs.",
      "Michael Carrick played an attractive brand of football at Middlesbrough(Image: Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)",
      "Another strong point of Carrick's was being an \"excellent man manager\", says Johns, lauding the 44-year-old's ability to manage personalities as well as develop skills.",
      "\"Fundamentally, he’s a coach,\" said Johns. \"He loves being out on the training pitch and working with the players on development. Most players regarded him as an excellent man manager.\"",
      "But the negative side of Carrick's tenure - in-game management - contributed to his downfall. \"Particularly concerning was the amount of times Boro led in games only to throw it away in second halves,\" said Johns. \"In-game management was seen as a particular weakness.",
      "\"All too often, the opposition would make changes and Carrick wouldn’t react quickly enough to the momentum switch as it unfolded. He was reactive rather than proactive, and often too late. They dropped so many points from winning positions.\"",
      "Despite the in-game management aspect, there are plenty of positives to take from Carrick's time at Middlesbrough for United fans - particularly his ability to manage players, which will be important at a star-studded club like United.",
      "Another element that could help Carrick is his understanding of United as a club, the culture and knowing what fans want, as Johns concludes. \"For what Manchester United want in this moment, I actually think it’s an appointment that could work,\" he said. \"Their players would seemingly suit his preferred style, and he’s already worked with quite a few of them and, it appeared, had their respect.",
      "\"If he can deliver the same kind of uplift he did when first arriving at Boro, it’ll be exactly what Manchester United need until the end of the season. An arm-around-the-shoulder approach to boost confidence after what appeared a rather cold head coach in Ruben Amorim could be exactly the same as following Wilder at Boro.",
      "\"Being a Manchester United legend, you’d imagine he’ll unite everyone in and out of the club, and will understand the ethos and the ‘United way’, which Amorim just didn’t do.",
      "\"On top of that, all the criticisms I’ve given of him for his time at Boro, I think it’s only fair to nuance that by reminding, this was his first head coach role. When in the middle of the fire, you maybe don’t get a chance to be as reflective as is maybe needed to recognise the mistakes you’re making.\"",

      "The forward didn't earn a first-team appearance for United during his time at the club but had loan spells with Rochdale and Tranmere Rovers, while he was apart of the FA Youth Cup-winning side in 2022.",
      "Mather chronicled his time at the club, displaying wholesome pictures of signing his contracts and in action for the club in a post to Instagram. In the caption, he said: \"After 14 years my time at @manutd has come to an end, I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.",
      "\"I will always be grateful for my time here and wish the club all the best.",

      "Despite having another 18 months on his contract, the 21-year-old wants to compete in a professional environment and as a result, has decided to leave his boyhood club in favour of a fresh challenge.",
      "After missing out on a summer exit, Mather has taken part in first-team training sessions at Carrington this season. The youngster has made six appearances in academy fixtures to maintain match fitness.",
      "Shea Lacey, who has emerged as the latest academy graduate to make their first-team bow, was among those who offered their best wishes to the winger.",
      "The 18-year-old said: \"Good luck my brother all the best.\"",

      "As part of his move to Turkey, a fee and buyback clause have been agreed and installed in the deal.",

      "The striker doubled United's tally in the second half after Tyrell Malacia put them ahead. His first came from close range before he made it 4-1 with a calm finish inside the area.",
      "Obi has now scored five goals in nine Premier League 2 games this season. His tally in Telford was his first in the league since he scored in 2-1 win over Liverpool at the end of September.",

      "Last season, the striker played eight times for United, with seven of those games coming in the Premier League. However, the early Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town in August has limited opportunities this term.",

      "United Under-21s are currently top of Premier League 2 after winning eight of their first nine games. However, Benjamin Sesko's slow start at Old Trafford and Joshua Zirkzee's uncertain future mean Obi could get an opportunity under Carrick.",
      "Earlier this season, former United boss Amorim was criticised for his words on the club's academy. The Portuguese suggested there was a level of entitlement at United when quizzed on his decision not to use Kobbie Mainoo more often.",
      "\"I think it's the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" Amorim said in his press conference ahead of Man Utd's trip to Aston Villa in December. \"Sometimes strong words are not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not a bad thing for kids. We don't need to always be accolades in everything, every situation.",
      "Michael Carrick is expected to take over at Manchester United until the end of the season(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",

No, let's stay and fight, let's overcome and maybe the manager is wrong. I have the feeling we need to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match. [Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in the U21s.",

      "Ramsay was appointed as a player development coach at United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021 before going to work under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag. He has also worked as an assistant coach for Wales and had spells with Swansea, Shrewsbury and Chelsea.",
      "The appointment was confirmed hours after the Baggies beat Swansea in a penalty shoot-out to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup. Ramsay, who has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, replaces Ryan Mason, who was sacked on Tuesday after a 2-1 defeat at Leicester City.",

      "Fletcher oversaw his second game in charge against Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, but United suffered a 2-1 defeat to crash out of England's oldest cup competition at the first opportunity. United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town in August, meaning the defeat to Brighton ensures there will be no silverware won at Old Trafford this term.",

      "\"We got back to 2-1 and the energy was up but ultimately we couldn't get over the line. I think you can see the players are fragile. You need to dig deep. The fans weren't happy at the end, they have every right to do that. I'm sure if the players show the right reaction, the fans will get behind them like they always do.\"",

      "Lacey looked like a player worthy of wearing the famous No.7 shirt in the future when he came off the bench at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. The youngster came close to making a fairytale cameo, but that appearance in Lancashire should only be the start of his next chapter.",

      "\"I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game. I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "United have exercised patience with Lacey, who has struggled with muscle injuries, and the youngster deserves credit for staying determined to reach the first-team despite his progress having stalled.",
      "Lacey has been forced to watch as academy peers have been given their debuts over the last 18 months. United wrapped him up in cotton wool to protect him, and that foresight should now pay off.",
      "Lacey came close to scoring against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "The youngster has carried a huge reputation within youth circles since he was a boy. For some, expectation and pressure are too much, but Lacey got his head down and stuck to his task.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",
      "Lacey often took time to take photos with fans at Leigh Sports Village after academy fixtures and signed autographs before leaving the ground. The signature requests might be about to skyrocket this year.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his senior bow against Aston Villa in the Premier League last month, and Tom Heaton gave him words of encouragement as he prepared to come on from the bench.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made a beeline for Lacey when he didn't get a chance to make his debut against Wolves at Molineux. United were leading 4-1, and it felt like the perfect moment for Lacey to come on. However, he had to bide his time and was rewarded at Villa Park just a few weeks later.",
      "Harry Maguire, who is represented by the same agency as Lacey, has also provided the youngster with advice. There is recognition from senior players about his quality and potential.",
      "Fernandes speaks to Lacey at Molineux.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's rare to find someone who was born in Liverpool who supports United, but the youngest of three brothers, Shea is that anomaly. Lacey once had a season ticket at Anfield, but his middle brother, Luis, would complain that he wasn't interested in watching Liverpool.",
      "\"I can’t go from hating Liverpool in the morning when I’m playing against them, to supporting them,\" Lacey told his family, referencing how it felt to represent United's academy.",
      "Lacey's father is the reason he chose to join United's academy over Liverpool when he was just a boy. Shea's oldest brother, Paddy, came through Liverpool's youth system, despite his father telling him that Manchester was the best place for him to develop due to the better coaching.",
      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",
      "\"The shot he did against Burnley, cutting in from the right, all the wonderful coaches who have worked with him down the years, we've seen that strike from Shea a thousand times.",
      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

Benjamin Sesko bundled the ball over the line in response, but with 85 minutes gone it was always going to be an uphill struggle to find a way back into the tie.",

      "For that sole purpose Fletcher - or whoever is interim manager for the remainder of the campaign - will want a number of absent players and restore the squad to full strength.",
      "United's injury list has actually depleted in recent weeks, leaving just Matthijs de Ligt the only individual sidelined. In his case this has been due to a back problem since November, though the central defender does not yet have a return date outlined.",
      "Meanwhile, Lacey's red card on Sunday means he will have to serve a one-match suspension. The 18-year-old will miss next weekend's Manchester derby at Old Trafford and only becomes available again for the January 25 trip to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",

      "As for Mazraoui, he and AFCON hosts Morocco are part of the last-four and will play Nigeria for a place in the final. Regardless of the outcome, the full-back will only be available for United's meeting with Arsenal on January 25 because the losers of the semi-final will contest a third-place play-off on January 17, with the final scheduled for January 18.",

      "Referee Simon Hooper shows a red card to Shea Lacey in Manchester United's miserable FA Cup exit to Brighton at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Simon Hooper was correct to send off Shea Lacey for his act of dissent during Manchester United's FA Cup third-round elimination at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion, says Keith Hackett, the former head of refereeing body PGMOL.",
      "The 18-year-old had been introduced as one of Darren Fletcher's second-half substitutes and rippled the top of Brighton net shortly before Benjamin Sesko's 85th minute goal brought United back into the cup tie at 2-1 behind.",
      "A full fightback was not to be for the home side, who now only have Premier League football to play for the remainder of the season. Heaping more misery on the FA Cup exit was Lacey's sending off.",
      "The forward had been booked by referee Hooper for the first in the 87th minute for bringing down Yasin Ayari. Two minutes later, he did the same to Ferdi Kadioglu.",
      "Although the second foul was not deemed a second bookable offence itself, Lacey reacted by throwing the ball in anger and this was the action that earned his dismissal.",
      "In review, former PGMOL chief Hackett told Football Insider: \"Simon Hooper is correct in cautioning this rather petulant action which, of course, was a clear act of dissent.",
      "\"Hopefully the player will not do it again,\" he added about the United teenager from Liverpool, who was visibly distraught with the sending off in just his third senior appearance for the club.",
      "Lacey protested Hooper's decision before making his way off the field. He pulled his shirt over his face as he approached the Old Trafford tunnel, and television cameras caught the youngster kicking a wall in further frustration over the incident.",
      "After the dust had settled, the United player took to Instagram to post an apology to the club's supporters. He wrote: \"I want to apologise to all of my teammates staff and the fans [sad pensive face emoji]. I let everybody down tonight I shouldn’t let my emotions get the better of me I will do everything I can to make this right [praying emoji].\"",
      "Lacey will now serve a one-game suspension as a result of receiving two yellow cards in one outing. Because these carry across English domestic competitions, it means he is ruled out of next weekend's Premier League Manchester derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on January 17.",
      "The 18-year-old will next be available for selection for United's trip to the Emirates Stadium, where they will play league leaders Arsenal, on January 25.",

      "Darren Fletcher at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup against Brighton on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United fell at the first hurdle in the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town, and another disappointing defeat against Brighton means they will play just 40 games in all competitions this season.",
      "The Reds came into the game on the back of a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday. There were positives to take from Turf Moor, but Brighton drew first blood at Old Trafford in the first half of the game.",
      "Former United striker Danny Welbeck netted to extend Brighton's advantage. Benjamin Sesko scored with five minutes remaining to give hope of forcing extra time, but Shea Lacey was shown a second yellow card.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "At some point this week, a Manchester United great will ride back into Carrington and look to rescue a season that has hit rock bottom.",
      "Surely it can't get any worse than this. Fans of nostalgia will remember Mick McCarthy's iconic response to a press conference question along similar lines. \"It can,\" came the droll response. They are certainly fans of nostalgia around these parts and it's Manchester City and Arsenal up next.",
      "United's cup endeavours are over for another season, embarrassed by a team from the east coast and humbled by one from the south coast. This is a team all at sea. Darren Fletcher's chances of being the white knight are almost certainly over after his team were beaten by a smarter, slicker and more streetwise Brighton.",
      "Defeat in the FA Cup third round means United will play just 40 games this season and they have lost at the first hurdle in both cup competitions.",
      "This season is turning into an annus horribilis, but then so do most of them at Old Trafford these days. A trawl through the record books is difficult in the search for easy comparisons, but 1981/82 was the last time they went out of both cups at the first hurdle.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: One horrible moment with the ball at his feet in the first half, when he was lucky he wasn't punished. Did at least shrug it off well. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Early miss set the tone. Struggled defensively and got decisions wrong in the final third. Brighton got a lot of joy down United's right. 4",
      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Passing continues to be a major weakness and United need more from their No.6. His days are numbered. 4",
      "Read the full player ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "There will be no silverware this season.",
      "Lacey shown a second yellow card. That's a really harsh decision from the referee.",
      "You can never rule United out when they're chasing a late goal at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko scores a header from a corner and we suddenly have a game on our hands.",
      "Casemiro and Maguire ON.",
      "Ugarte and Martinez OFF.",
      "There were positives to take from the Burnley game, but this has been regression from United.",
      "Lacey beats his man down the right and plays a wonderful cross to Sesko in the box. That was oldschool wing player from the youngster. Fans around the press box jumped to their feet to applaud the move.",
      "Welbeck loves a goal at Old Trafford and finishes into the top left corner.",
      "Lammens had no chance with that strike from the former United striker.",
      "Mainoo and Mount OFF.",
      "Zirkzee and Lacey ON.",
      "Mainoo is shown a yellow card after a lazy challenge.",

      "Fernandes",
      "Close with free-kick 6",
      "Cunha",
      "Playing too narrow 5",
      "Sesko",
      "Making the right runs but needs to time them better 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Fletcher needs to have words during the break because this has been poor. Brighton made six changes to their team today, but they are leading at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes just screamed in frustration as his pass to Sesko failed to be controlled by the centre-forward. There was a little bit too much on it, meaning Sesko had little chance of latching onto the pass.",
      "United’s right side is malfunctioning at the moment. A lot of the play coming over this way, but Dalot been poor and Mount struggling with the width. Kadioglu also really exposing Mount when it comes to running in the other direction. It’s a strength for Brighton at the moment.",
      "United are struggling to build up from the back because Brighton are so well-coached.",
      "Brighton almost played all the way through United from their goalkeeper, but Dorgu recovered to thwart the danger. Dorgu has been in decent form over the last few weeks and has started well again today.",
      "United made a really quick start to the game, creating a handful of chances, but have faded.",
      "That is a disastrous goal to concede for United. The space and overload against Dalot was worked so easily and the marking in the middle was poor as well. They had started so well but that is basic stuff. Lucky not to concede a second with some poor distribution from Lammens. Suddenly rocking here and need to steady the ship. They have to get better defensively.",
      "I'm not sure what was going on down that flank. Brighton were given far too much space and time. Fletcher is watching a replay of the goal alongside Binnion on the bench, trying to work out who was responsible. Mount was pulled out of position and Dalot was left totally exposed.",
      "Brighton have taken the lead through Gruda at the Stretford End.",
      "Fletcher turned around to his bench and shook his head.",
      "\"We want the Glazers out,\" is the chant currently coming from the Stretford End.",
      "It felt like United would start games very passively here under Amorim, there was a strange lack of tempo and intensity, but they’ve come flying out the blocks today. No surprise under a head coach like Fletcher, who had the shackles off on Wednesday, but it has immediately got the crowd into it as well.",
      "Fletcher applauds Mainoo for dropping in between the defenders, picking up the ball from Lammens and turning. Mainoo is brilliant at that - he provides the team with an outlet to play from the back.",
      "Huge chance for Dalot but his finish was tame and straight at Steele.",
      "It was a gorgeous ball from Cunha, who picked the ball up from deep."

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "According to respected reporter David Ornstein, Manchester United have ‘reached an agreement’ with Michael Carrick over becoming their new interim manager.",
      "In recent days, Man Utd legend and former Middlesbrough manager Carrick has overtaken Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to become the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "It has been a week since the Red Devils parted company with Amorim, who is set to be replaced by an interim boss until the summer. At the end of this season, the Premier League giants will look to appoint a more established boss to oversee a long-term rebuild.",
      "In the meantime, Carrick has been tasked with steadying the ship for the remainder of this season, with Ornstein revealing to The Athletic on Tuesday morning that he has ‘reached an agreement’ with Man Utd.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘The deal, which includes the former midfielder’s proposed staff, is subject to finalising contract details with an announcement expected soon.",
      "‘Should everything progress as planned Carrick’s first game in charge would be against rivals Manchester City on Saturday at Old Trafford.’",
      "Previous reports have revealed that Carrick has been backed over Ssolkjaer because he impressed Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox during talks, while he has support from players.",
      "TalkSPORT have since revealed that ‘legendary former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson recommended Carrick over Solskjaer’.",
      "The same report has provided insight into who will be part of Carrick’s coaching team.",
      "They explained: ‘Carrick wants [Darren Fletcher] to be on his coaching staff as well as Jonny Evans, who worked as Fletcher’s right-hand man for the FA Cup defeat as well as a draw to Burnley in the Premier League last week.",
      "‘Carrick is hoping to recruit former Leeds, Newcastle, Real Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur and England defender Jonathan Woodgate to Old Trafford onto his coaching staff as well.’",

      "Manchester United are reportedly keen on signing former Wolves captain Ruben Neves, who is available for £20million in a transfer that has the potential to be the signing of the year.",
      "Neves is available this month for a bargain fee with his Al Hilal contract set to expire in June.",
      "United are interested in adding the Portuguese midfielder during the January transfer window and there appears to be little competition for his signature. Quite simply, they cannot mess this up.",
      "According to The Guardian, the Red Devils are targeting a new midfielder this month, with Neves firmly on their radar.",
      "United are expected to be active in the transfer market despite not having a permanent manager in place, with the report stating that Michael Carrick is set to be appointed interim boss this week.",
      "The club’s hierarchy are assessing whether a move for Neves is ‘viable’ and, if so, funds are available to complete the deal.",
      "The report states:",
      "With midfield one of the positions United want to strengthen, Al- Hilal’s Rúben Neves is a target. The Portuguese would cost about £20m and should his acquisition become viable there are funds available for his purchase or for any other player on the club’s transfer wishlist.",
      "Neves is exactly what United need. In fact, he’s exactly what many elite teams need. He remains a top-level midfielder and has not declined since moving to Saudi Arabia from Wolves in the summer of 2023.",
      "The 28-year-old was never reliant on pace, and he certainly hasn’t stopped moving in the Middle East.",
      "He still starts regularly for Portugal in a midfield that includes Vitinha, Joao Neves, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Joao Palhinha.",
      "Neves is a player Europe’s elite cannot ignore, and at £20m, he is a no-brainer for almost every top club. Which begs the question: why aren’t more teams in for him?",
      "United should act decisively before more come to the party. Central midfield has been a problem position for years.",
      "Ball-dominant teams often need a ball-playing defensive midfielder, not pure destroyers like Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Arsenal have Martin Zubimendi. Liverpool have Ryan Gravenberch. Manchester City have Rodri. Newcastle have Sandro Tonali. All four are superb on the ball and possess the defensive intelligence required to anchor midfield for elite sides.",
      "Casemiro has improved recently, but he is no longer the defensive force he once was, and he is certainly not someone who dictates tempo or consistently plays line-breaking passes.",
      "Neves would bring control, experience and genuine quality to United’s midfield. At £20m, he is a bloody steal, and could be the bargain of the year if the Red Devils do what they so often fail to do: the right thing.",

      "The 44-year-old previously served on Solskjaer’s coaching staff and, following the Norwegian’s sacking in November 2021, stepped into a caretaker role himself. Carrick oversaw wins against Villarreal in the Champions League and Arsenal in the Premier League, as well as a draw with Chelsea.",

      "Solskjaer was outstanding during his interim spell, winning 14 of his 19 matches, but the wheels came off after he was handed the job permanently.",

      "Manchester United’s worst fears appear to have been realised when it comes to the capture of primary midfield target Elliot Anderson, with sources telling TEAMtalk that bitter rivals Manchester City have already ‘made contact’ over a big-money deal.",
      "The Premier League’s transfer mill is heating up once again, with Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson firmly at the centre of intense speculation ahead of the summer window.",
      "As the winter window looks like it could end without a move for the 23-year-old England international, attention has shifted to what could become one of the most hotly-contested deals of the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "Multiple sources indicate that Man City are preparing a strong push for Anderson’s signature, with manager Pep Guardiola said to be a major admirer of the versatile central midfielder. Indeed, my colleague Dean Jones recently detailed City’s firm interest in the player just last week.",
      "City’s recruitment team, including director of football Hugo Viana, has closely monitored Anderson’s progress at the City Ground, where he has established himself as a key figure.",
      "Indeed, insiders suggest Guardiola views Anderson as an ideal fit for his tactical system – capable of operating as a deep-lying playmaker or box-to-box No. 8 – with the technical quality and composure to thrive in high-possession environments.",
      "Sources close to the situation reveal that City have already made contact with Anderson’s representatives, signalling their intent to formalise interest when the summer market opens.",
      "This has sparked significant concern among rival suitors, particularly Man Utd, who have identified the former Newcastle United academy product as a top option in their planned midfield overhaul.",
      "Indeed, United are targeting multiple reinforcements in the engine room, with Anderson high on the list alongside Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "United’s anxiety stems from City’s perceived advantages: their proven track record of success, Champions League pedigree, and the allure of working under one of football’s most respected tacticians.",
      "Some sources even claim Anderson himself is keen on a move to the Etihad, with whispers that he sees no better opportunity to elevate his career. This has led to assessments from rival clubs that, should City submit a competitive bid, they would enter as clear favourites.",
      "Nottingham Forest, however, hold a strong hand.",
      "Anderson is tied to a long-term contract until 2029, giving the club leverage to demand a substantial fee. Valuations range from £80million to over £100m, with some sources suggesting the price could climb further if Anderson shines for England at the upcoming World Cup.",
      "Forest have repeatedly stated no interest in selling in January, emphasising their desire to retain key assets amid their push for a stable Premier League position.",
      "Other clubs, including Chelsea and Bayern Munich, remain in the conversation, but the narrative increasingly frames this as a potential City-United showdown. With City’s midfield requiring fresh legs to complement stars like Rodri (as he returns to full fitness), Anderson represents a strategic long-term investment.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are still absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in nine games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",
      "",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly finding Ruben Amorim’s departure tricky to get over as the Red Devils receive a huge deal for his serviced.",
      "The Tottenham board are “split” on the future of Thomas Frank with some concerned the head coach is “not a good fit” for Spurs, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "An insider account has revealed that some Tottenham stars feel Thomas Frank is ‘waiting to be sacked’ by the club, where there he will earn around £20million.",
      "A Tottenham journalist how long he feels Thomas Frank has left at the club as they are “dysfunctional” and his “lifeline is getting shorter and shorter.”",
      "Spurs were almost entirely awful for all but five great second-half minutes against Aston Villa – and that will keep Thomas Frank in gainful employment."

      "Darren Fletcher was unable to part the dark clouds above Old Trafford, but the interim-interim manager has achieved some little victories, if no actual wins…",
      "Fletcher is reporting to Carrington on Monday morning to hear what Manchester United have in mind for the rest of the season. Reports suggest Michael Carrick has emerged as most likely to take over.",
      "He may not have won any games, losing to Brighton after a draw at Burnley, but Fletcher’s brief reign wasn’t a dead loss. There were some positives to take despite the bleak overall outlook.",
      "Handily for features like these, we’ve counted five…",
      "",
      "Mainoo v Amorim was in danger of becoming 2026’s Pogba v Mourinho, especially while the midfielder’s idiot half-brother was hellbent on milking his sibling’s exile for all the attention he could.",
      "Still, it was very clear that if Amorim remained in charge, Mainoo was finished. The manager did not trust the England star to play at the base of his midfield and he was way down the pecking order for the more advanced positions. A parting seemed inevitable…another academy product sold off and most likely to go and be a huge success elsewhere.",
      "But Amorim’s exit makes that prospect far more remote. There is a role for Mainoo in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, but the 20-year-old still has plenty to prove after almost a lost year.",
      "Upon returning from injury for the first post-Amorim game – convenient timing, that – Fletcher has given Mainoo the platform to build upon for the remainder of a season that may be all-but finished for the club, but the next 17 games are crucial for the player.",
      "",
      "Funny though it would have been to see Fletcher stick with a back three after Amorim, the interim-interim boss was never going to pass up the easiest win imaginable by reverting to a back four.",
      "Not only to highlight a contrast between himself and Amorim; a back four simply suits the players at his disposal despite the previous manager’s desperate attempts to shoehorn them into a 3-4-2-1.",
      "Especially the full-backs. Had Amorim stayed, United would have needed at least one, probably two new wing-backs. Literally all those who have played in the position over the last year are more comfortable as full-backs.",
      "It times of struggle, it is always easiest to revert to what comes natural and we would be stunned if any of United’s defenders have grown up more used to a three than a four. These Red Devils evidently don’t catch on quick (ask Ralf Rangnick), so it makes complete sense to simplify things, and the principles of defending in a back four are less taxing on the brain.",
      "All they need to do now is remember the basics of marking and closing down. One step at a time…",
      "MORE: Michael Carrick next? Man Utd have snubbed one of six best caretaker managers",
      "",
      "Another easy win, especially at Old Trafford, can usually be achieved by throwing in a kid. Fletcher resisted the temptation to do that with his sons but threw in Lacey, an 18-year-old who has been tearing it up in the academy.",
      "That is not to say that Fletcher promoted Lacey ahead of time for his own ends; the teenager has earned his promotion. But Fletcher has clearly been more willing than Amorim to facilitate it.",
      "Coming off the right flank, Lacey was bright against Burnley, almost scoring a stunner with his first senior touches, and against Brighton, it was evident his senior team-mates trust him. Of course, his two yellow cards were stupid and United have to hope it serves as a steep learning curve. But Lacey has whetted the appetite for more cameos through the remainder of the season.",
      "To ham up his association with the academy and all that represents at United, Fletcher could have included 15-year-old JJ Gabriel in his squad for Brighton. That he didn’t is a positive. At least let the lad finish school before throwing him into the circus ring.",
      "",
      "Sesko has been a tough watch since he arrived from RB Leipzig for around £70million in the summer. He’s certainly not the only big money striker to arrive from abroad and take some time to settle, but the Slovenian’s confidence appeared to be draining to dangerously low levels.",
      "That’ll happen when you don’t see the ball. Granted, there have been times when it has been slung his way and he’s been shrugged off it too easily for a lad of 6’5″, but far too much of his involvement in United’s play was far too far from the opposition goal.",
      "That seemed to change against Burnley. Not only did he score twice, doubling his tally through the first 16 games in one night, but there was undeniably a greater emphasis on finding Sesko around the box. His two goals came as a result of seven shots on target – the most any player has managed in a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Another goal though ultimately inconsequential followed against Brighton, with his three goals all different finishes: a first-time volley to meet a cross; a one-v-one after a run in behind; and a header from a set-piece.",
      "Whoever comes in needs to make sure Sesko retains a similar supply line that Fletcher has laid for the centre-forward.",
      "",
      "United’s search for a new manager is obviously their most pressing business. But their skipper’s situation needs plenty of attention too.",
      "Reports suggest he’s had enough of United’s s*** and fancies getting away in the summer. You cannot blame him. Fernandes has been brilliant for United since he came through door in 2020 and perhaps only after he leaves will his contribution be truly appreciated by some.",
      "From United’s perspective, hopefully there is still time to show Fernandes that it doesn’t have to be this bleak because literally no one would trust the club to replace his record-breaking creativity – he’s created double the number of chances of any other United player – in a summer when they are preoccupied with a manager.",
      "On that, Fletcher has made a positive start simply by playing Fernandes in a position closer to his best. Under Amorim, he had to play at the base of the midfield and he made a decent fist of things. But United – and Sesko – need him closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Against Brighton and Burnley (he played only an hour upon return from injury) in attacking midfield positions, Fernandes created five chances in each game, above his season average of 3.3 per 90. At Turf Moor, his withdrawal and United’s loss of control was no coincidence.",

      "After watching their loss in the cup, you couldn’t help feeling sorry for them. Even Darren Fletcher wore a sorrowful, hollow-eyed look, looking less like a caretaker and more like an undertaker standing graveside. In his post-game interview he already looks broken by the experience.",

      "Working on the basis that everyone looks better when they leave (Scott McTominay’s career seems to be a permanent case of ‘look at what you could have won’ with two more goals on Sunday), that must apply to the current iteration too. In other words, they can’t actually be that bad. But everyone tells them they are, all of the time. It has to be demoralising for a previously highly-rated player. Certainly every bit of skill, decent pass etc, seems immediately followed by a clumsy error.",
      "Just when they got back into the Brighton game, they picked up a red card. It sometimes feels like self-sabotage. There are roars as they go on the attack, which immediately turn to groans as a pass goes astray or is intercepted. At the final whistle, they all looked bereft, their season already effectively over. Highly remunerated under-performers stealing a handsome living. It’s embarrassing.",
      "But then they’ve had to tolerate possibly the worst ownership/management team in the league. A collection of over-promoted dunderheeds who are trying to pretend they’re professionals, who never answer for their poor choices. or have the first clue how to run a football club. But they can’t admit this, not even to themselves.",
      "This results in a Mr Magoo management style, where they blindly careen from one disaster to another, unable to see how pathetic they look or realise that everyone is laughing at them. There are good examples of better ways to run a club but they seem impervious to them, doubtless arrogant enough to feel they’ll do it their own way. Arrogance and misplaced self-confidence are a particularly toxic mix.",

We have chronicled 19 mistakes, some of which are so feeble, only a total fool would have even thought to do them. But with the arrogance of someone who’s made money, he can’t bring himself to believe he’s been wrong about anything ay all.",
      "Look at the way they’ve treated Bruno Fernandes, who now seems set to leave in the summer. It may be a low bar to qualify as United’s best player but it’s not sensible to alienate him and treat him like a prime cut of beef to be sold at a premium. Only to compound their idiocy, they don’t actually sell him, leaving a man on the books who feels disrespected and the team’s confidence on the floor. Stupid at every turn.",

They got so big in the successful years that it was a wild dog; they thought if they just kept feeding it red meat, it would never turn on them and they would never need to have a plan B. Obviously they don’t know what they’re doing and are making fools of themselves. But they see themselves as competent execs being let down by the players. It must be galling for the staff.",
      "As an example of some of the worst contemporary management styles, they can’t be beaten, frequently making terrible decisions that any of us could warn them against. Jason Wilcox has got a lot wrong and yet is kept in a job. What would he have to do to be dismissed? And what next? Install Tim Sherwood as club hairdresser?",
      "The players have to perform with clown cars bursting into flames all over the place, all of the time. Is it any wonder things sank to a nadir and have barely recovered? It’s clear to everyone that the problems with everything stem from this idiotic ownership. You can’t expect a team to perform well in a toxic atmosphere which is telling them they’re rubbish. Admittedly, they are rubbish, but they said that about Rasmus Højlund and he’s transformed at Napoli, which is hardly a model of stability. United is a curse for players that cannot be lifted.",
      "Every poor performance is another humiliation, not just a mid-table team losing. And the poor performances aren’t just narrow losses. Like against Brighton, they’re played off the park and look totally deflated.",
      "Obviously, playing staff isn’t the problem. They can play well, but not for United. They’re not useless wasters, even if United seem to have turned them into exactly that. Until the entire ownership goes away, the problems will continue. But history suggests they’ll keep throwing money at it to ever-decreasing effect and the players will continue to be booed for the failures of amateur executives who’ll continue to say nothing. As an example of how not to run a club, they are in a league of their own.",

It is thought another coach coming in to support Carrick would also be on the cards.",

      "“He’s a threat, he’s shown that and I think there’s so much room to improve. Physically, he’s got some amazing traits. I think he’ll get better and better. But the onus shouldn’t just be on Benjamin Sesko to score goals.",
      "“Back in the day, United had four or five strikers. You think about Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Then they had young lads coming through: Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, [Carlos] Tevez.",
      "“It shouldn’t just be Benjamin Sesko, a young man still learning his trade. We saw that with Rasmus Hojlund and how that ended, he’s on loan.",

      "It looks very much like Manchester United will opt for Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the caretaker role.",
      "It’s bold because Solskjaer has form; we rate his previous stint in charge as one of the best best spells in football history.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nSolskjaer was a surprise choice to step in when Jose Mourinho burned his bridges at Manchester United in December 2018. His senior management credentials consisted of a couple of spells at Molde in Norway around a failed tenure at Cardiff.",
      "But United didn’t need tactical acumen and complex man-management nous, apparently. All that was required was a big smile, an abundance of positivity and endless references to 1999 to lift the Mourinho fog.",
      "Solskjaer was due to return to Molde at the end of the season but United stumbled upon the next Sir Alex Ferguson when they appointed their former striker. Or so it seemed from the Red Devils’ form. Under Solskjaer, the Red Devils went unbeaten for a dozen Premier League games, winning 10, before a stunning fightback to beat PSG in the Champions League last 16.",
      "So giddy were United after that night in Paris, they gave Solskjaer a three-year contract. Which was hardly the wrong call at the time. We all egged them on.",
      "But, alarmingly quickly, it all went to sh*t. Solskjaer’s players reverted to type, taking their foot off the gas to win only two of their last 12 games.",
      "Solskjaer’s two full seasons in charge brought third and second-placed finishes, but never did he convince the majority that he was the right man for such a prestigious position. His third campaign was a disaster, leading to the sack when United dropped to eighth with an appalling defeat at Watford. United appointed another interim, Ralf Rangnick, but the players paid due attention for roughly 12 minutes.",
      "He wanted to repeat the trick after the sacking of Ruben Amorim but it seems the club has chosen Michael Carrick instead.",
      "",
      "Roberto di Matteo\nChelsea were fifth in the Premier League, three points behind the top four – and were still in two of the other three competitions open to them – when Andre Villas-Boas was sacked at the start of March in 2012. In relative terms, this was not even close to a crisis. But at a club that had not finished outside the top three during Roman Abramovich’s ownership, panic buttons were pressed far more readily.",
      "Villas-Boas’s assistant was subsequently thrust into the limelight. Di Matteo won his first four games in charge, including a famous 4-1 victory over Napoli in extra time of their Champions League last 16 second leg, and a crushing 5-2 win over Leicester in the FA Cup quarter-final. He would go on to beat Tottenham 5-1 in the semi-final and Liverpool 2-1 in the final to lift one trophy, but that was only the half of it.",
      "After the thrill of the Napoli tie, Chelsea strode past Benfica comfortably in the quarter-finals. Against all odds, Barcelona were beaten in a Gary Neville orgasm-inducing semi-final, before Bayern Munich found the Di Matteo tidal wave irresistible in the final. From caretaker to history-maker, Di Matteo had finally delivered Abramovich’s holy grail, 18 months after being sacked by West Brom.",
      "Chelsea handed a full-time contract to the Italian in the summer, unable to part with a man who had finally guided them to Europe’s summit. He was sacked within the first three months of the following season.",
      "",
      "Tony Barton\nDi Matteo was only following in the footsteps of Tony Barton. Appointed caretaker manager of the flailing but reigning First Division champions in February 1982, Aston Villa’s former chief scout made enough of an instant impact to be given the permanent job within a couple of months.",
      "Barton oversaw no miraculous improvement in league form, taking Villa from a relegation-threatened 17th to a safely mid-table 11th. But again, it was in Europe where he conjured magic from nothing. By the time Dynamo Kiev were beaten in the European Cup quarter-finals, Barton’s future in the hotseat was still far from certain.",
      "Two weeks after that success, Barton was given a three-year contract. But the honeymoon had only just begun: Tony Morley laid waste to Anderlecht in the semi-finals, before Peter Withe helped slay Bayern Munich in Rotterdam. Having begun the season with no prior first-team coaching experience, he ended it inflicting Bayern’s first ever defeat in a European Cup final.",
      "Villa simply couldn’t keep that remarkable pace. They finished sixth the following season, reaching the quarter-finals in defence of their European crown. After coming tenth in 1983/84, Barton was sacked and soon fell by football’s wayside, with Villa themselves suffering an ignominious relegation three years later.",
      "",
      "Glenn Roeder\nNewcastle were floundering in February 2006. With just six points separating them from the bottom three, the Magpies were compelled to act; Graeme Souness was sacked, the Scot blaming a 12-year-old Paul Pogba for his demise.",
      "His replacement was the unassuming, wholly unqualified Glenn Roeder, promoted into a role as Batman to Alan Shearer’s Robin with a remit to make St James’ Park great again.",
      "A five-game unbeaten run was ended with three consecutive defeats in March, as the club continued to struggle for consistency. But six wins in their last seven games lifted them into seventh, and meant that Roeder won ten of his 15 league matches in charge, compared to Souness’ seven wins in 23. Yes, he was given the permanent job. Yes, he barely lasted a full season. There’s a theme here.",

      "Chelsea were mired in fourth-placed crisis when they pulled the trigger on Luiz Felipe Scolari in February 2009; they would go on to finish third, win the FA Cup and lose a ‘f***ing disgraceful’ Champions League semi-final against Barcelona under Guus Hiddink. They found themselves in actual dire straits when he returned for a second stint in December 2015, but the Dutchman took them from one point outside the relegation zone to mid-table comfort.",
      "Hiddink has been Chelsea manager for 49 games in all competitions, winning 26 and losing just seven. He still holds the record for longest unbeaten start to a Premier League tenure with 12 games in 2015/16.",

      "It was a weird time. As Roy Hodgson was busy picking fights with Frank Rijkaard, signing Milan Jokanovic, losing to Northampton Town and admitting Liverpool were “in a relegation battle” as early as October, the spectre of Kenny loomed. The Scot returned to Anfield in summer 2009 in a role at the club’s academy, but would soon find himself steering a sinking senior ship.",
      "Liverpool were 12th when Hodgson was sacked and replaced with Dalglish in January 2011 – the club legend’s first managerial role in 13 years. They lost their first two games but an eight-match unbeaten run restored some pride on Merseyside. A 3-1 win over Manchester United, assisted by the worst hat-trick in Premier League history, saw the Reds finish strongly in sixth.",
      "Dalglish was rewarded with a three-year contract in May 2011, but his permanent reign is less fondly remembered. He was sacked after just one full season that included two cup finals, an eighth-placed finish and a misguided, regrettable defence of actual racism from one of his players.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that former Man Utd midfielder Michael Carrick is now “leading” the race to become the interim manager at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a falling out with director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and the January transfer window, making his position at Old Trafford untenable.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been in caretaker charge for their 2-2 draw away at Burnley in the Premier League and their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup over the weekend.",
      "And now Man Utd plan on installing an interim head coach until the end of the season before appointing a permanent sucessor to Amorim in the summer.",
      "Former Man Utd striker Solskjaer had been the favourite to come into Old Trafford as the interim boss but Romano has revealed that Carrick is now the frontunner.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “In the last 12 hours, Michael Carrick has made important progress in talks with Manchester United after a face-to-face interview.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans plead for Wilcox sack after season ends v Brighton",
      "“The meeting between Manchester United management and Michael Carrick was very positive in terms of ideas, tactics, communication and intention. The feeling was really good, and as of tonight Carrick is becoming the leading option for the interim job.”",
      "“Ole Gunnar Solskjaer immediately made himself available via his agents after Ruben Amorim was sacked. Manchester United had a meeting with Solskjaer and it was a good one. He is ready to help the club and very excited about the opportunity.",
      "“For Solskjaer it has never been about money or contract terms. He would be absolutely ready to return to Manchester United, but in the last 24 hours the Carrick option has clearly advanced.",
      "“Manchester United were quite happy with Darren Fletcher’s methods in training. But the Brighton game was always going to be decisive.",
      "“After a poor performance against Brighton and elimination from the FA Cup, the club decided to accelerate talks for a different interim manager. Fletcher was never the favourite, and after that game his chances were effectively over.”",
      "Carrick will still have a chance of landing the job on a full-time basis if he does well – but Romano has made it clear that Man Utd’s process to recruit a permanent manager “will not stop” while the interim boss does his job until the end of the season.",
      "Romano added: “Manchester United will start immediately a process to prepare the new permanent managerial appointment for the summer. They will identify a shortlist of two or three candidates and begin meetings with managers and their representatives.",
      "“Even if the interim manager does a very good job, United will not stop this process. If it is Michael Carrick and he performs well, he will obviously have a chance, but the club will still work in parallel on a permanent solution.",
      "“The understanding from sources close to Manchester United is that an official announcement is expected very soon. Possibly within 24 to 48 hours.",
      "“Carrick is ready to say yes, Solskjaer is waiting, and financially it will not be a problem. At this stage it is a club decision, but Michael Carrick is now the favourite to become Manchester United’s interim manager.”",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2025/26 season?",
      "According to respected reporter David Ornstein, Manchester United have ‘reached an agreement’ with Michael Carrick over becoming their new interim manager.",
      "Man Utd have chosen tactics over vibes but are treading familiar ground with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who will reportedly join this week.",
      "According to reports, Lucas Paqueta is nearing an exit from West Ham United as he has an ‘agreement’ over a transfer after he ‘asked not to play’.",
      "Two factors have reportedly contributed to Manchester United opting to favour Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the interim manager’s role.",

He’s married, has kids and something of a career but cant forget those glory days of 1998-2001.",
      "Watching the game the United fans stuck me as the same – all the songs were about Cantona, about Solksjaer (I appreciate he’s just left as manager), even one about Scholes. It’s not just the singing, they wanted Ronaldo, not just because he was once one of the world’s top two but more strongly because he was a link to the past. How many times does the camera cut back to the crowd to pick out Ferguson?",
      "United fans it’s time to move on. Whilst you spend time looking backwards football has moved on. Old Trafford is rapidly going the way of the old Wembley – full of football nostalgia but in no way a stadium for the 21st century.

I also wrote that I don’t think he has been helped by “Handsome Hughes” changing half the team. Allow me to explain a bit further.",
      "Last year, as soon as we won the ball, a defender would look to Diaz or Nunez for a quick break; a ball over the top or down the line was often the option. If that wasn’t on, VVD would look for the cross-field ball to Salah. However, with those two quick outlets now gone, and the resulting change in style, these options are no longer available.",
      "The slower transition has led to a more congested midfield, which in turn has negated last year’s other outlet: the drilled pass into Gravenberch, allowing him to turn the press and glide through the centre of the park.",
      "With Slot putting Frimpong wide and high on Thursday, the team finally seemed to rediscover a bit of last year’s mojo. Yes, there were no shots on target, but Frimpong’s pace and directness forced Arsenal to drop deeper in the second half. This, in turn, gave Gravenberch and Mac Allister space to pass between the lines and break the press, something we had not managed for several months.",
      "I only hope that Slot recognised this and keeps Frimpong higher up the pitch despite Bradley’s injury. Sometimes, playing a lesser player in the correct position, while keeping the other ten in their natural roles, is the better option. I am reminded of when we lost all four centre-backs five years ago and played the inexperienced Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams. Keeping them at centre-back allowed Henderson and Fabinho to remain in midfield and helped us secure a top-four finish.",
      "Speaking of the top four, I am heartened by Man United reverting to type when trying to find a solution to their 253rd crisis since Sir Alex left. However, if I were on the interview panel and a candidate mentioned “Fergie” and DNA, I would thank them, end the interview, and reject them out of hand. Sir Alex is a legend, one of the best managers of all time. He deserves his stand, a statue, and everything that comes with it.",
      "But hearing that interims, caretakers, and members of the Class of ’99 still seek his advice, permission, and even refuse to park in his space is embarrassing. Guys, it’s been 13 years. Bill Shankly was asked to stop coming to the training ground because of his status. In Klopp’s first interview, he said (circa) that the weight of history is like a backpack, it needs to come off. United (and I am quite happy that they are) are choosing to carry this Fergie-sized bag.",
      "Onto another example of sycophancy. I am surprised that so little has been made of the atrocious coverage of the Arsenal–Liverpool game on Thursday. I don’t think Liverpool were praised as much for winning the league as Arsenal are for being six points clear. The noises from Nevillier and the fawning adjectives pouring from the a$$-chapped lips of Drury were embarrassing. The producer and director also spent more time showing the Lego Sith Lord than I have seen devoted to other managers combined this season.",
      "This continued, unwarranted flattery is one of the reasons the club, in general, behaves so appallingly. The manager demands, and receives, respect he has not yet earned. A reminder to the suck-ups: he has spent close to a billion pounds and has one FA Cup and three second-place finishes in a beauty contest to show for it. Being constantly told you are brilliant and the best has fuelled Arteta’s ego and afforded him a level of impunity, evident in his touchline antics.",
      "Persistently operating outside his technical area, instructing his players to slow the game down at set pieces (then complaining when others do the same), and, in one instance, dragging an injured player back onto the pitch to time-waste sends a message to his squad. This is why I think Martinelli acted as he did. It is learned behaviour from the one person at the club who should know and act better. A few years ago, F365 ran an excellent comparison of Klopp and Arteta; it may be worth dusting off for a new generation.",
      "So I am torn. I don’t believe Liverpool or Villa will win the league, which leaves a choice between this Arsenal side or Man (115) City. Which of the two would be the least soul-destroying?",
      "I need a drink already.",
      "Have a great week all,\nIan H",
      "",
      "I beg you to sell this thing. Beg you.",
      "You are motivated by money. That’s ok. We live in late-stage capitalism. Everything is for sale. Bezos once sold books, which is quite cute, now he sells whatever the f he wants.",
      "You would get an astonishing return on your investment. Which is what motivates you.",
      "Because you sure as hell can’t claim that you genuinely have the interests of the fans at heart? Surely?",
      "In 2017/18, Spurs were better than Liverpool. Since then they’ve won 2 league titles and a champs league. In 2019 Villa were in the championship and Spurs were in the champions league. Now look at them.",
      "In that 7 years you have appointed numerous managers none of whom you’ve been able to empower in to achieving anything close to what the club is capable of achieving. You have had some world class footballers and not built around them. You currently have some footballers who actually seem to care. They’re as angry as the fans. But you have a manager who despite being a nice fella, is a bit of a doughnut. Micky Van der Van does not like or respect Thomas Frank. It’s clear. That isn’t the basis for a successful team.",
      "There is still some lingering gratitude for what you’ve done. Genuinely. The club is in a far far better shape than the one you took over. But your leadership / ownership actually peaked on the last day at White Hart Lane.",
      "It really is time to go.",

      "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United last week; Michael Carrick is the favourite and is in detailed discussions about the interim role; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been spoken to by his former club",
      "By Rob Dorsett, Dan Khan, Vik Varange",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 08:17, UK",
      "Manchester United are close to agreeing terms with Michael Carrick for him to become interim manager until the end of the season.",
      "There is no final agreement as yet, and no paperwork has been signed, but the plan is for Carrick's contract to run until the end of June.",
      "Over the last few days, both Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have met with Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, who is leading the process to appoint a new boss.",
      "Carrick and Solskjaer were both candidates for the role and both former United players have met with the club's bosses and made their pitches for the job.",
      "The current short-term interim head coach, Darren Fletcher, said after the 2-1 defeat by Brighton in the FA Cup that he has now reached the end of his agreed period in charge of the first team, and he will report to the Carrington Training Centre on Monday to find out what the club want from him next.",
      "United only have the Premier League to focus on now, having been knocked out of both cup competitions, and so the focus for the interim head coach will be to qualify for European football next season.",
      "Carrick is believed to be keen for his former assistant at Middlesbrough, Jonathan Woodgate, to join him on the coaching staff at Manchester United.",
      "It's not clear as yet whether United are prepared to agree to Carrick's wishes in terms of giving a short-term contract to the former Leeds United defender, while talks continue over the make-up of the backroom staff.",
      "It is possible there is a coaching role for Darren Fletcher, who has his last game in charge of the first team against Brighton in the FA Cup.",
      "United's record goalscorer and former Derby and Plymouth Argyle boss Wayne Rooney has also expressed interest in joining Carrick's coaching staff.",
      "Speaking on the Wayne Rooney Show podcast, the former striker said when asked if he would be open to joining him: \"Of course I would. I think it's a no brainer if that's the situation but I think that the club needs is people around the place, so whether that's if Michael goes in for instance, Fletch or John O'Shea or myself or whoever it needs people around the club who know the football and Roy Keane, I think.",
      "\"Having people who know the club, who care for the club, who understand what it takes to be a Man United player I think that's where the club needs to be.\"",
      "\"They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge 10 years ago, then Ole came in charge and you go back to the old boys, then you go for a new one, then you go for more experience.",

      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

      "The full-time whistle was greeted with boos before near silence ensued with the Man Utd supporters and players left stunned by yet another lacklustre performance. The loss means United will play just 40 games this season - their lowest since the 2014/15 campaign when they played 44 games, and Fletcher said that the fans had every right to show their displeasure.",

      "Fletcher attempted to gee up the crowd when he returned, but there was little to cheer during a disappointingly slow start to the second period. Lacey and Joshua Zirkzee were introduced in a bid to change the dynamics, but just moments later Brighton extended their lead.",
      "Welbeck received a pass from Gruda and was all too easily able to take a touch and slam a 65th-minute shot into the top left-hand corner.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the message from the United fans as they urged their side to get back into the game. Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",
      "\"You can see that the players are fragile and they need to build themselves up. It's up to them now, they've got to respond.",
      "\"Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football and when you don't have it, you have to dig deep, you have to win, battle, fight, grind, work, win games and then the confidence comes back.",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Had Shea Lacey's late strike found the net rather than the frame of the goal, it would have been one of those magical Manchester United moments. A young player who the supporters had wanted Ruben Amorim to trust with more minutes proving the hero.",
      "That Lacey was on the pitch at all was a product of more than Darren Fletcher's desire to lean into United's youth legacy but an attacking switch that saw United finish the game with Burnley at Turf Moor with a midfield duo of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "The away support appreciated it, chanting Fletcher's name as well as that of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick - two men touted with a return. But United need more than mere sentiment right now, they are chasing Champions League football.",
      "Games against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley have not yielded a single victory. They have now contrived to drop points to all of the bottom seven teams in the table since November. Even five points from the last three games would have United in the top four.",

      "Brentford scored more goals in open play than Chelsea last season. They were the fifth-highest scorers overall and produced 1.5xG fewer than Arsenal across the course of the campaign.",
      "But at a side with resources he could have only dreamt of 12 months ago, he has overseen relative drops in every single attacking metric.",
      "His old Brentford side was crafted with Matthew Benham's superbly honed data-driven system with a hit rate for finding hidden gems to rival any Premier League scouting department.",
      "He does not have that tailor-made side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but that does not mount anything like a sufficient excuse for the insipid football he has served up in his first six months.",
      "With results and style so poor, it's inevitable the pressure is ramping up around Frank. He must find a way to change things and fast before it is taken out of his hands.Ron Walker",
      "It's been a tough start to 2026 for Man City.",
      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",
      "And while Brighton did spurn some really good early chances, it wasn't City's makeshift defence that cost them victory at the Etihad.",
      "Pep Guardiola bemoaned the chances his side wasted, not only against Brighton, but also in the draws against Sunderland and Chelsea.",
      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",

      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",

      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",

      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",
      "The extra games United would gain from a cup run could prove very important for the rest of their season, as the new head coach (or coaches) try to bed-in their tactical system, and also get some much-needed game-time for the wider squad.",
      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",
      "In the background, of course, is the much more significant process of deciding who should be the head coach going forward.",
      "After paying around £10m in severance to Amorim and his staff, United will again want to try to avoid a big compensation bill for whomever they employ next.",
      "That is at least part of their thinking about why it is best to kick the can down the road, and postpone the big appointment until the summer.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",
