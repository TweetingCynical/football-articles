      "Ralf Rangnick is being treated in hospital and in need of further treatment after contracting an infection following ankle surgeries, say reports in Germany.",
      "The former Manchester United interim manager, 67, has undergone multiple surgeries on his ankle in recent months. And the Austria national team has now contracted a 'hospital-acquired germ' after his latest surgery in Murnau, Bavaria, last week.",
      "Complications from ankle surgery and the subsequent infection means Rangnick will now remain in hospital for an extended period. He initially underwent ankle surgery in June but was forced to undergo an emergency operation due to complications in July. His ankle issues saw him undergo another operation last week, with Bild saying Rangnick's infection is the 'serious reason' behind his extended stay in hospital.",
      "Johannes Gabel, an ankle specialist who has worked with some of Germany's top stars including Manuel Neuer and Jamal Musiala, will oversee Rangnick's further treatment.",
      "Rangnick's situation means he has been forced to pull out of the upcoming Austria squad announcement on September 29 ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Romania next month.",
      "He is expected, though, to be back on the touchline for those games. Rangnick's assistant, Lars Kornetka, will now announce the squad for those games.",
      "Rangnick had a brief stint as United's manager between December 2021 and May 2022 after the club decided to part company with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, winning 11 of the 29 matches he oversaw before the Red Devils appointed Erik ten Hag.",
      "Rangnick had initially signed up to take on a consultancy role at the club following his spell in the dugout. However, it was decided he would leave Old Trafford shortly after agreeing a two-year contract to become the new head coach of the Austria national team.",

      "Manchester United are set to return to Premier League action this Saturday, as they head to the Gtech Community Stadium to face Brentford. After a sluggish start to the 2025/26 season, the Red Devils will be hoping their recent victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford signals a change in fortune.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro found the back of the net after Robert Sanchez was given his marching orders early in the match. Ruben Amorim's squad will be making the journey to London for the weekend's early kick-off, with their sights set on securing their first win at Brentford since January 2022.",
      "Those tuning in or attending the match will notice a slight change in United's appearance. For the first time this season, United will be donning their black third kit. Up until now, they've sported their red home shirt in all six competitive matches, with the white away kit only making an appearance during pre-season.",
      "The third kit, with its black base, features yellow and blue accents, paying homage to the away kit worn from 1993 to 1995.",
      "However, for the Brentford match, United will be sporting a unique kit to adhere to regulations regarding kit clashes.",
      "Typically, the kit would consist of black shirts and shorts to match.",
      "But due to Brentford's black shorts and socks, the Reds will be pulling on yellow socks for this particular match.",
      "Arsenal had to make a similar kit adjustment last week when they faced Athletic Club in the Champions League.",
      "The Gunners' away strip, which is predominantly dark blue and black, including the shorts and socks, clashed with Athletic's home kit, forcing them to switch to white shorts and socks.",
      "The Premier League regulations stipulate that \"when playing in league matches the players of each participating club shall wear a strip which is of a sufficient contrast that match officials, spectators and television viewers will be able to distinguish clearly between the two teams.\"",

      "Greater Manchester Police have confirmed they are investigating after a Manchester United supporter who has gone viral on social media for vowing not to cut his hair until the club win five games in a row was assaulted at the weekend.",
      "Frank Ilett, who has gained over 374,000 followers on his 'The United Strand' Instagram account, announced last year that he would not be chopping his locks until the Red Devils chalk up five successive wins. He has since appeared on podcasts, radio shows and his posts have been shared all over social media after going over 350 days without a haircut due to United's poor form.",
      "However, things turned sour at the weekend when he was grabbed by the hair by a man who seemed to be a fellow fan during Saturday evening's 2-1 win over Chelsea. The man can be heard yelling: \"F*** off, I'll do what I f***ing want\" and \"he's not a United f***ing fan\" whilst lunging forwards in front of spectators on the Old Trafford concourse, including youngsters, in a video which has been widely shared on social media.",
      "It has now been confirmed that both Manchester United and Greater Manchester Police are probing the incident. A spokesperson for GMP said: \"We are fully aware of this incident and the investigation is ongoing in conjunction with Manchester United.",
      "\"The victim has been contacted and enquiries are ongoing to identify the offender.\"",
      "\"I have of course been a Man United fan my entire life and my intention with this challenge was never to highlight Man United's flaws. It was all a bit weird to be honest. I will always try to focus on the positives and hope that this was just a one off.",
      "\"I thought he was just joking to start with, but then he started yanking my hair and calling me an 'attention seeking c**t'.",
      "\"The whole day was full of hundreds of positive interactions yesterday and 99 per cent of all of the reactions to this challenge have been nice. But just a few people can ruin it!",
      "\"Like I've said before, I never expected it to go on for so long, but I'm hopeful we can go on a good run soon and I, more than most... want these wins to come as soon as possible.\"",

      "Across his 15 European appearances, he found the net eight times and contributed six assists, including two in their commanding 5-0 triumph over Inter in May's showpiece. The 28-year-old looked visibly moved whilst receiving the Ballon d'Or award on stage.",
      "Taking to social media afterwards, he posted images alongside the trophy with a message reading: \"So much joy, pride, and emotion.",
      "\"A dream come true. Thank you to everyone who has always supported me along this journey.\"",

      "Manchester United have reached out to offer Amad support after he was on the receiving end of online abuse over the weekend. Amad deleted all his Instagram posts after United fans criticised his decision to share a photo of himself with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The United winger posted a photo of himself posing with Garnacho's Chelsea shirt alongside his former team-mate, who was holding up his United shirt. The meeting between the two came after United beat Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "Although he didn't get onto the pitch after Robert Sanchez's early red card for Chelsea, it was Garnacho's first trip back to his former club following a £40million transfer in the summer. Amad is friends with the Argentina international, who is also represented by the same agency, but the post did not go down well with fans.",
      "The 23-year-old was abused by some supporters and reacted by deleting all his Instagram posts and all but one of his posts on X. The Sun reports that United checked on him on Monday and offered support.",
      "Despite his reaction to the backlash, Amad is understood to be okay. After playing the full 90 minutes against Chelsea, he will be hoping to keep his place in the side for when United travel to face Brentford in the league on Saturday.",
      "United have a full week to prepare for the trip to west London, having already been knocked out of the Carabao Cup. While most Premier League sides are involved in the third round competition in midweek, United were beaten on penalties by Grimsby Town in the second round in August.",
      "Amad has featured in all six of their matches so far this season, starting all but one fixture. He has so far contributed just one assist for the struggling side, who sit 11th in the Premier League following their second win of the campaign on the weekend.",
      "Garnacho left United under a cloud in the summer after falling out with Amorim in the final few games of last season. The 21-year-old was told he had no future at the club and became a part of the 'bomb squad', forced to train with fellow exiles Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Garnacho was only made two brief substitute appearances for Chelsea so far, against Brentford and Bayern Munich, and stayed on the bench at Old Trafford following Sanchez's early red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.",

      "Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson was known for his strict discipline, and it seems that even video games on the team bus weren't safe from his wrath. The insight comes from former Red Devil Paul Scholes, who shared the anecdote on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and fellow ex-United star Nicky Butt.",
      "The conversation started when McGuinness mentioned a tale told by Old Trafford icon Wayne Rooney. The club's record goal scorer suggested that part of United's incredible success during his time at the club was due to the bonds formed while playing video games on the team coach.",
      "A number of United players, including Rio Ferdinand, John O'Shea and Wes Brown, would participate in sessions of SOCOM on the PlayStation Portable.",
      "However, despite Rooney's assertions, these gaming gatherings didn't sit well with Sir Alex, who was famed for his iron-fisted leadership.",
      "When quizzed about Rooney's comments, Scholes said: \"I didn't play those games, it was more the younger lads in the group.",
      "\"The PSP (the PlayStation Portable) and SOCOM, and I can hear them all f*****g shouting from the back of the bus, and it's sort some of shooting game, a war game, and it's all you could hear and it was f*****g annoying.\"",
      "McGuinness chimed in, asserting that bus journeys to and from matches were usually filled with card games rather than video games.",
      "Scholes added: \"I do remember the boss going down the back of the bus saying, 'Shut the f**k up - because they're all shouting at each other, 'We're on our way to Arsenal away here, what's wrong with you?'\".",
      "However, he did admit that there might have been some camaraderie benefits from the group gaming, saying: \"Sometimes it's quite funny as they are having a right go at each other at the back and there is a bit of camaraderie and it's a team game as well.\"",
      "\"I really believe a big part of our success was playing on the PSP,\" said Rooney. \"It got us communicating more - we used to play it on the plane, on the team bus.",
      "\"It would be me, Rio [Ferdinand], Michael Carrick, John O'Shea, Wes Brown. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go and revive people when they get killed and it was a massive part of our success - ask any of those players, it was brilliant.\"",

      "Manchester United demonstrated this summer that there are times when a sale is necessary, regardless of whether the deal is ideal for the club or not. Alejandro Garnacho had to be sold in the last transfer window as his relationship with the club was causing more harm than good.",
      "Marcus Rashford was a similar case, albeit to a lesser extent as it seemed he may not have completely severed all ties, but based on the evidence, it was still right to let him go. In retrospect, the Reds made a terrible mistake in letting Scott McTominay leave the football club.",
      "Like Garnacho and Rashford, United profited from the deal, making the books look healthier once he departed for Napoli. However, unlike his former teammates, McTominay was not a problem at United.",
      "His previous manager Erik ten Hag even expressed regret at letting the Scottish international go. Ten Hag hastily decided that he needed to bolster defensive midfield but instead of trying to offload Casemiro, who remains one of the highest paid players at the club, he sold an asset who is now taking the football world by storm.",
      "Remarkably, in his first season in Serie A, McTominay managed to flourish more than anyone anticipated. His tally of 12 goals and six assists marked the best season of his professional career, proving instrumental in Antonio Conte's side clinching the Serie A title.",
      "However, his redemption arc was only fully realised on Monday night when he ranked 18th in the Ballon d'Or standings, ahead of Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Florian Wirtz. And let's not forget, there wasn't a single United player to be found anywhere near the Top 30.",
      "At the time, the decision to sell McTominay seemed like a short-term move that hadn't been thoroughly thought through. While no one could have predicted his sensational season in Italy, the 28-year-old's story should serve as a warning for United's future decisions.",
      "History already seems set to repeat itself under Ruben Amorim, with Kobbie Mainoo's future looking increasingly uncertain. He requested a loan move in the summer, which was rejected, and so far, there's little indication that United will be able to satisfy his concerns before the January transfer window opens.",
      "If Mainoo were to 'do a McTominay', he would be better positioned to succeed given his younger age and less inconsistent form at Old Trafford. Failing to address Mainoo's concerns though could once again lead United to make a short-term decision that ultimately hampers the club's long-term progression.",
      "Mainoo is keen to remain with United, which is why he only requested a loan move. However, the rigid adherence to captain Bruno Fernandes could push him towards a permanent exit.",
      "Fernandes' contribution to the team is undeniable, but there's a real chance he could depart next summer. If Mainoo has already been forced out by then, United could find themselves in a tricky situation where they have to replace both men.",
      "Amorim needs to start grooming Mainoo now to be Fernandes' successor. It's clear that he has the talent for it, and United is a club known for giving young players a chance.",
      "If United are to learn anything from McTominay's success, it should be that sometimes it's better to nurture the next generation from within rather than selling them off for quick cash. If Mainoo does leave, it would demonstrate that the Reds haven't learned their lesson, at all.",

The on-loan Manchester United forward began last week brilliantly with a spectacular two-goal display for the La Liga club away to Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "But the 27-year-old found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench for Barcelona's 3-0 victory over Getafe on Sunday after widespread reports in Spain claimed he arrived two minutes late to a team briefing. Ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has now cautioned Rashford that his conduct is \"not good enough\" whilst supporting Barca boss Hansi Flick's uncompromising stance on punctuality.",
      "It follows the Mirror reporting that the two clubs remain significantly apart regarding an agreement on the transfer fee needed to make the England international's loan switch permanent. Barcelona are believed to be eager to sign Rashford at a knockdown price of £26million, whilst United are hoping to secure closer to £35m for their academy product.",
      "Foster voiced his frustration over Rashford's latest indiscretion, despite lauding him for recapturing his best form in the Newcastle clash.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Rashford got a couple of goals, it was a fantastic performance and he just looked proper. It was old school Marcus Rashford and we love to see it.",
      "\"Then he goes and gets dropped at the weekend because he was late for a team stretching session on the morning of a game. The way that Barcelona have dealt with it, you can tell Hansi Flick doesn't take any s***.\"",
      "Foster later added: \"It's disrespectful and I understand people going, 'Oh, he's [only] a minute or two late,' but it doesn't matter. There are 29 other people there who are waiting for you. If you can't get the basics right, then it's not good enough.\"",
      "Rashford isn't the only player to fall foul of Flick's strict discipline code, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and most recently Raphinha all facing sanctions for similar infractions. Rashford was expected to start the Getafe clash on the left flank of Barcelona's attack, but Ferran Torres was selected in his place.",
      "Despite being left out, he displayed no visible signs of annoyance and entered the fray to replace Raphinha at the interval. Rashford shone on the right wing, setting up Dani Olmo's decisive third goal that sealed victory.",

      "Former Aston Villa star Stan Collymore has predicted Manchester United will soon be 'sniffing around' Unai Emery to replace Ruben Amorim. Current Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after a dismal start to the season - the club's worst since the 1992/93 campaign.",
      "Currently languishing in 11th place in the Premier League, United also suffered an embarrassing League Cup defeat at the hands of Grimsby Town. The club's rocky start follows a disappointing 15th place finish last season - their lowest in the Premier League era.",
      "Adding insult to injury, they were defeated by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May, meaning Old Trafford has no European football for the first time in over 10 years. With Amorim's position becoming increasingly precarious, it's no surprise that some of Europe's top managerial talent are being linked with the job.",
      "One such name is Villa's Emery, who was rumoured to be in the frame during Erik ten Hag's troubled tenure at United last year. Despite a slow start to the season with Villa, Emery's work in Birmingham has been widely lauded.",
      "His potential departure from Villa Park seems more plausible following the exit of the club's President of Football Operations, Monchi, on Monday, as he and Emery have been closely associated. Now, Collymore has weighed in on the unexpected news from his old club.",
      "\"Monchi. Lots of social media with others in recruitment about how hard they worked (so do others, especially Brighton and Bournemouth) which struck a chord with Villans as the going was good,\" he said via X (Twitter).",
      "\"But I make it three resounding successes in the market (players who play for the first team, not jiggery pokery for PSR) in Tielemans, Rogers and Pau out of a 20+ incoming of players. That's average recruitment at best. Emery wanted him and this now raises the question as to whether Unai's tenure will now grind to an end of season halt (*fires starting pistol on speculation every week about United, etc etc etc) or whether Unai has agreed with my analysis, biffed off a great friend but \"business is business\" and a new shiny recruitment guy comes in with a better strike rate.",
      "\"Said on here a few weeks back that recruitment at a club like Villa has to be at 80+% success rate in order to compete so that's the task for the new person. I hope Emery strikes up a rapport with someone new and gets his mojo back, doubles down and commits to the long haul.",
      "\"He's not of our neck of the woods though, he'll have suitors in Spain, probably one or two big Italian clubs and should United be serious about change then they'll have a sniff too, why wouldn't they, they can offer almost unlimited resources to back up what Villa did last season with multiple seasons of serious cash support.",
      "\"The next 48 hours will tell everything. If he's bullish and wants to stay, you'll see it as he's a straight talker. If he doesn't look at the camera, fidgits with his ear and doesn't answer 'do you see your long term at Villa?' then the owners and new recruitment guy need to get a list together quickly in case he exits sooner or end of season. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. UP THE RECRUITMENTLESS VILLA.\"",

      "The Old Trafford side had been leading 2-0 after Robert Sanchez was sent off in the fifth minute, with goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. However, Casemiro was also shown a red card just before half time, and Trevoh Chalobah capitalised on some slack defending to head home with 10 minutes left.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been spared by the Spanish media after being dropped for arriving late to a pre-match meeting. Despite his superb match-winning brace against Newcastle in the Champions League last week, the on-loan striker found himself on the bench for Barca’s La Liga clash with Getafe on Sunday.",
      "Rashford came off the bench at half-time and set up a Dani Olmo goal as Hansi Flick’s side strolled to a 3-0 home win. Since the game, it has been widely reported in Spain that Rashford was cut from the starting line-up after being two minutes late for a team rendezvous.",
      "His tardiness has been attributed to filling out an electronic form, which the club requires every player to complete each day. The Manchester United loanee wasn’t late for the pre-match activation session, due to start an hour later, but Flick, a strict disciplinarian, insists any player who doesn’t arrive on time doesn’t start the following game.",
      "Rashford isn’t the first player to be affected by the German coach’s team rules, with Jules Kounde, Inaki Pena, and, most recently, Raphinha being dropped for similar reasons. Rashford was reportedly due to start the Getafe game on the left side of Barca’s attack, but Ferran Torres got the nod instead.",
      "His response to his omission was telling, though, with no suggestion that he sulked about being dropped. After replacing Raphinha at the break, Rashford impressed on the right side of the attack as well as laying on Olmo’s game-clinching third goal.",
      "While the Spanish media has largely overlooked aside Rashford’s indiscretion, former Spain international Lluis Carreras wasn’t so lenient as he backed Flick’s methods. He said via SER: “I can’t imagine being late to a training camp. It shows the coach that you're not fully focused on the match.",
      "“Since you haven’t been focused, I’ll give you half so you can stay involved in the game. Raphinha [who scored twice after coming on against Valencia] showed that with two goals, Rashford with an assist, and it seems logical to me.”",
      "But it was all positive from Rashford after the game when he took to Instagram. “+3 points, vamos equipo [let’s go team],” he wrote with an image of himself in action.",
      "When questioned about his decision to bench Rashford, Flick insisted he was managing the forward’s workload, saying: “For Rashford, it’s normal not to play. Matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes.",
      "“You saw that with Fermin. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.",
      "“We scored three goals, and it's not always easy to score three goals against a strong team. I don't want to talk about the opponent; I want to talk about my team. We must focus on our game and our plan.” Barca, who are two points behind leaders Real Madrid, visit Real Oviedo on Thursday.",

      "The forward also chipped in with an assist during their weekend 3-0 triumph against Getafe, extending his impressive beginning since his latest temporary switch from Old Trafford. Rashford has returned to the headlines following his positive performances but it comes after his unceremonious exit after being cast aside under the Portuguese tactician.",

      "He'll be closely supervised under a tough 'closed regime' if there is space for him in local jails unless he makes an eleventh-hour payment.",

The court decision is understood to be based on the alimony payments Anderson owed as of July 28.",

      "His lawyer Julio Cezar Coitinho Jr confirmed to local press the case involved minors but said he couldn’t comment because of a secrecy order. Anderson was said to be father to four children in 2015 and NINE children at the start of last year when he recalled his time at United in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper.",

      "Sesko was signed for £74million and that price tag is set to hang over him until he finds the back of the net. Ferdinand couldn't believe his lack of involvement in what was a dominant first-half display for the Red Devils - in part owing to his lack of service.",
      "The ex-United defender said on his Rio Presents podcast: \"In the first half, against 10 men, he’s had six touches. Six touches! I think the responsibility goes to the striker as well [as other players].",

      "Ronaldinho subsequently became the planet's finest footballer whilst in Spain. He claimed the Ballon d'Or in 2005 whilst securing two La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2006.",
      "In his memoir, Sir Alex revealed precisely how near the Brazilian transfer came to completion. \"I had agreed a deal to bring him to Old Trafford. Carlos Quieroz [United's assistant manager at the time] was there and would vouch for that,\" Ferguson wrote.",

We thought he was going to bring something special, almost like what (Eric) Cantona brought to the team. Then three days later we're playing against him in Seattle, so everyone's trying to kick him! We were trying to beat him because he didn't sign for us.\"",
      "Ronaldinho told El Enganche in 2014 that boardroom changes at Barcelona, plus the club's track record of nurturing Brazilian talent, swayed his decision.",

A great friend of mine was about to become a part of the Barcelona board: Sandro Rosell,\" Ronaldinho said. \"I was almost on my way to Manchester United and only the details needed to be put onto that deal. But in the last minute Rosell called me to tell me they would win the election. That made everything happen fast. I wanted to play in Barcelona.",
      "\"I had the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of my idols. I was proud to play where Romario, Ronaldo and Rivaldo had played and I had the chance to be Barcelona's new 'R.' I loved that.\"",

His Barcelona team-mates Raphinha, Jules Kounde and Inaki Pena have all previously fallen foul of the same rule in the past.",
      "Despite beginning the game against Getafe on the bench, Rashford quickly made up for lost time after replacing Raphina at the break. The United loanee took just 17 minutes to provide an assist for Dani Olmo as Barcelona completed the 3-0 scoreline as he provided the perfect response to being dropped to the bench.",
      "For his part, Flick played down any sense of his team selection being because of a disciplinary issue. \"For Rashford, it's normal not to play, matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes,” he said. “You saw that with Fermin. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim sent a clear message to Jose Mourinho after the former United boss was named Bruno Lage’s successor at Benfica. Amorim was linked with the Portuguese giants, where he spent much of his playing career, before Mourinho’s appointment. Following United’s win over Chelsea, Amorim credited Mourinho’s early successes for giving other Portuguese coaches, such as himself, the chance to get top jobs.",
      "\"He’s the best Portuguese manager, and that won’t change.\" Amorim told DAZN Portugal, as reported by A Bola . He’s always been a very special person in our football, but also in the world, and he opened all the doors for us.",
      "\"I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Jose Mourinho. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun for you in Portugal, and we’re going to enjoy it. But that’s the way it is, and we’ll be here, watching to see what happens, but focused only on Manchester, and that will be my only club.\"",
      "Former United defender Phil Jones fears that Amorim’s reluctance to start Kobbie Mainoo could see the midfielder leave the club in the near future. Mainoo saw a loan request rejected during the final days of the summer transfer window, but the 20-year-old has made jus three substitute appearances in the Premier League, with his only start coming against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"It just looks like at the minute he’s out of favour. The manager has already come out and stated he's not going to be playing with Bruno,\" Jones said of Mainoo’s situation on Stadium Astro. \"It's going to be him or the other and you're not going to dislodge Bruno in the form that he's in and the way that he carries the team at times with his assists and goals.",
      "\"So, he's going to find it difficult for games and United aren't in any European competitions this season. There's not another competition that he might've got some game-time in.",
      "\"Time will tell, but I think by Christmas and January time, if he's not had the game time that he'll like, then I'm sure he will be trying to force a loan move.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chelsea will be hoping to return to winning ways against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup tonight, after falling to a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United. The Blues were hit with disaster early on as goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was sent off in the first five minutes for a last-man foul on Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro fired United into a 2-0 in the first 45 minutes, before the Brazilian was also sent off after receiving a second booking for a foul on Andrey Santos. Trevoh Chalobah made it 2-1 on the 80th minute, but it ended in defeat in Alejandro Garnacho's first game back at Old Trafford.",
      "Blues boss Enzo Maresca made some interesting substitutions throughout the game - likely due to his 'keeper's dismissal - with the Argentinian not making it off the bench against his old club. Midfield superstar Cole Palmer was also taken off early against United, as the Italian issued a fresh update on the England international's fitness as he struggles with a groin issue.",
      "Meanwhile, incoming Chelsea striker Emanuel Emegha was snubbed by the Strasbourg fans after scoring the winner as captain at the weekend. Despite celebrating his strike in front of the supporters, many of the crowd looked less-than-impressed with his appearance on the pitch.",
      "Garnacho returned to Old Trafford for the first time since his £40million switch to Chelsea in the summer - but he didn't make it off the bench.",
      "As Chelsea chased an equaliser during the final 10 minutes, many would've thought that the Argentinian winger would've been brought on for his flash of pace and ability on the flanks. And this was part of the plan. However, despite receiving tactical instructions in the second half, Garnacho never made it onto the pitch.",
      "Maresca has confirmed that this decision to snub the 21-year-old was down to the need to make substitutions elsewhere.",
      "Speaking post-match, the Italian said: \"Garnacho was ready to go, but then Wes [Fofana] asked for the change because he was tired after a long time so we decided to go for Malo [Gusto].",
      "\"But the idea was to give Garnacho minutes.\"",
      "Garnacho's return to United was met with a hostile reception from fans, with a symphony of boos ringing out every time he made an appearance from the bench during warm-ups.",
      "When asked if the poor atmosphere towards the youngster affected his decision to sub Garnacho on, Maresca shrugged off this notion and remained resolute in his first answer.",
      "He said: \"No, no, no. He was ready, I sent him for the warm up and he was ready but then Wes asked for the change so we decided to go with Malo.\"",
      "Incoming Chelsea striker Emanuel Emegha dealt with his own troubles in a similar fashion to Garnacho at the weekend, despite scoring for Strasbourg on Sunday. The 22-year-old has agreed a seven-year deal with the Blues, but won't head to Stamford Bridge until 2026.",
      "This means that the Strasbourg captain will remain with his current club - who function under the same owners as Chelsea - for the first half of the French season. However, this news hasn't been met with the best of responses from the fans, who have made their feelings known towards Emegha.",
      "In the club's 1-0 win over Le Havre last week, the striker was left out of the starting line-up, but a banner still went up in the crowd slamming the star's Chelsea move. It read: \"Emegha, pawn of BlueCo, after changing your shirt, give back your armband.\"",
      "This distaste continued into Strasbourg's 3-2 win against Paris FC, where Emegha topped off his return to action with a goal, which was subsequently confirmed by VAR after being chopped off initially.",
      "During the celebrations, the 22-year-old ran up to the away crowd and held his shirt up to them in a statement of intent. While some fans celebrated the goal, many could be seen looking unimpressed - which angered boss Liam Rosenior.",
      "The 41-year-old said: \"Emegha was devastated, and I was too. I am very disappointed by what I saw. Seeing banners against one of last season’s best players is unacceptable.\"",
      "The sale of Emegha to Chelsea was brought forward due to UEFA rulings, as per L'Equipe. If the two clubs had ended up playing in the same European competition next season, then the transfer would've been blocked - but it seems that Strasbourg fans aren't bothered much about the legal inner-workings of the deal.",
      "Maresca has issued a positive update to star player Cole Palmer ahead of the club's Carabao Cup tie against Lincoln City. The midfielder was taken off against United, in one of three substitutes within the first 20 minutes after Sanchez' red card and Fernandes' opener for the Red Devils.",
      "The England international had previously struggled with a groin injury, and Maresca confirmed that this issue is unlikely to result in surgery.",
      "Speaking ahead of the trip to the League One side, he said: \"The medical staff, they didn’t mention to me about surgery until today. I don’t know if in the next days or the next weeks, but I don’t think so, to be honest.\"",
      "However, it is likely that Palmer won't be in the starting line-up against Lincoln in midweek, with the Italian being able to rest some key players as they take on a lower-league side.",
      "The Blues have two tough games coming up in the Premier League and in Europe. Brighton and Hove Albion will come calling on Saturday, before ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho brings his Benfica side to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League.",
      "It is most possible that Palmer will be looking ahead to these tests, with other fringe stars being handed opportunities in domestic cup fixtures as and when they come up.",

      "Manchester United have been informed why the correct call was made to send off Casemiro during their weekend triumph over Chelsea.",
      "The Red Devils secured a 2-1 win against the west London side in their Premier League encounter at Old Trafford on Saturday night. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro found the back of the net for United in a match that saw both sides finish with ten players.",
      "Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez was shown a straight red inside the opening five minutes following a challenge on Bryan Mbeumo just outside the box. Casemiro was shown a red card in first-half stoppage times after collecting two yellows for challenges on Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos.",
      "The decision to give Casemiro his second caution has sparked discussion after referee Peter Bankes gave the United midfielder his marching orders. Now, ex-Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has revealed why he thinks the right call was made",
      "\"The second one - people will say to me, 'Is it enough for a second yellow card?' I am forever saying not every tackle after a yellow card is a second yellow card, but the difference here is he has deliberately gone to pull him back.",
      "\"We see every week, we are saying 'Everybody who is pulled back gets a second yellow card'. People say, 'He [Casemiro] got the ball', he gets the ball because he pulls him [Santos] back. I think second yellow card, red card.\"",
      "However, former Premier League striker Jay Bothroyd disagreed, arguing that Casemiro should not have been dismissed for his challenge on Santos. \"I think that was harsh,\" Bothroyd stated.",
      "\"On the pitch, players know exactly what is going on. The player [Santos] has actually run across Casemiro, he can't get out of the way because he is running as well at speed.",
      "\"There is nothing you can do apart from maybe put your arms up and try and get out of the way. I think that is what he is trying to do there. I think that is really harsh to give him a second yellow there to send him off.",
      "\"I think that is really harsh because he is trying to get out of the way, there is nothing he can do there at all.\"",
      "As a result of receiving two yellow cards, Casemiro will now serve a one-match ban, ruling him out of the Premier League match against Brentford this weekend. The Brazilian will be eligible to play again in United's home game against Sunderland on October 4.",

      "Manchester United will pursue a 'major goalkeeper' in next summer's transfer window after Ruben Amorim confirmed that neither Altay Bayindir or the club's most recent signing, Senne Lammens, are locked in as the team's No 1.",
      "United responded by sealing an £18.2million deal for Lammens on the final day of the summer transfer window. However, the 23-year-old Belgian is viewed as a quality prospect for the future and is not guaranteed to play ahead of Bayindir, who looked more assured in Saturday evening's 2-1 win over Chelsea.",
      "But despite spending a significant sum on Lammens just weeks ago, The Sun claim that United plan to bolster their goalkeeping options again next summer, with an elite shot-stopper on the club's wishlist with Onana moving to Turkey.",
      "It remains to be seen who the Red Devils will target, though. They also weighed up a move for Emi Martinez before pressing ahead with a deadline day swoop for Lammens after seeing an audacious loan bid for the Aston Villa goalkeeper rejected earlier in the transfer window. It's understood he would have cost significantly more than Lammens, who is viewed as Belgium's next No 1 keeper.",
      "Onana was signed for a fee in excess of £47m back in the summer of 2023 as the club decided to part ways with their long-term No 1, David de Gea. However, Onana has looked a shadow of the goalkeeper who starred for Inter Milan, making a string of errors during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Bayindir has also struggled to convince when deputising for Onana. He was at fault for the only goal of the game in United's 1-0 loss against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season but has been picked for all five league games so far this term.",
      "\"No, nobody has a place that is his place,\" Amorim said recently when he was asked if Bayindir was now United's first-choice keeper. \"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford was talismanic for Barcelona in their Champions League win against Newcastle last week.",
      "Then Rashford reported late for a team meeting and was dropped against Getafe. Rashford was only two minutes late, but Hansi Flick enforced a disciplinary rule that meant he lost his starting role.",
      "Rashford might have been stuck in traffic or slept through his alarm. And it was just two minutes, but he is paid handsomely to do his job and should be able to follow Flick's rules at Barcelona.",
      "Manchester United wouldn't have been shocked to hear of Rashford's punishment for being late to the meeting, as there have been concerns about his off-field behaviour in recent years.",
      "Rashford was not axed from the club after a boozy jaunt to Belfast. Erik ten Hag was furious at the trip, but believed it would be detrimental to freeze Rashford out of his plans and disciplined him instead.",
      "Ruben Amorim was not as forgiving when he saw something he did not like with Rashford in December. The academy graduate was dropped for the Manchester derby and sent on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona offered Rashford the perfect opportunity to breathe life into his career. Most pundits predicted that Rashford would be a success - La Liga is a weaker league and a change of scenery was expected to do him good - and his performance at St. James' Park was a reminder of his ability.",
      "\"I am not surprised,\" Flick said. \"I think he's a fantastic player. His skills and finishing are unbelievable. I think also in the first half, he tried to create chances, but the finishing wasn't there.",
      "\"In the second half, it was. For a striker, it's always good to score. I am really happy. He is an important player. When we spoke before the season about what we needed in the team, we felt we needed a player like him. When we had this chance [to sign him], I said we have to do it. He's an outstanding player.\"",
      "Flick added that Rashford's display had represented the \"first step\" and reiterated he needed to make \"the next step.\" The German was hinting at consistency, but Rashford was denied the chance to build momentum due to his lack of punctuality.",
      "Rashford came off the bench against Getafe for the second half to record an assist. His talent has never been in doubt, but Rashford must strive to become a model professional to get the best out of his career.",
      "Amorim's stance on Rashford has ultimately been vindicated by the events of the last week.",
      "Rashford sparkled against Newcastle, a fixture in his home country with millions of British eyes tuned in, but he needs to produce those displays each week.",
      "It was brilliant to see Rashford in full flow against Newcastle, but everyone was thinking: where is this level every weekend? He is capable of so much but has struggled for consistency.",
      "His failure to produce those consistent performances and concerns about his behaviour away from the pitch have prevented him from bridging the gap to become a world-class player.",
      "Consistency is the hardest part of football, however, it shouldn't be difficult to follow club rules. Rashford's lateness shouldn't be blown completely out of proportion - it was only two minutes after all - but it's not the first time he's been disciplined.",
      "He has been given a chance he cannot afford to waste at Barcelona. It would be a huge shame to see him squander an opportunity to kick on in his career because of more discipline issues.",

      "It seems incredulous, as he approaches a year in charge of Manchester United, that Ruben Amorim has failed to win back-to-back Premier League games.",
      "Amorim's record of nine wins from 32 Premier League games is pitiful, but of just as much concern is his failure to carry over the winning formula from those games into the next one.",
      "Even David Moyes, who lasted just 10 months at United - the same length of time Amorim has been in charge - won back-to-back league games on seven occasions during his ill-fated spell in charge.",
      "At Brentford on Saturday lunchtime, Amorim will once again try to string successive league wins together and build on the momentum and confidence gained from Saturday's gritty 2-1 win over Chelsea at a rain-lashed Old Trafford.",
      "Victory at the Gtech Community Stadium in the early kick-off would propel United up to the dizzy heights of a top-five place, before the later games kick off.",
      "More importantly, it would provide tangible proof of the progress Amorim claims to see every day in training, but has yet to be translated into matches in terms of consistency of results and performance.",
      "After every league win under Amorim – and they have been hard to come by, let's be honest – it has been a case of one step forward, two steps back, a false dawn for United's manager, players and fans, with their ongoing failure to make winning a habit.",
      "After a rousing 4-0 win over Everton in only his second game in charge, Amorim delivered his notable “a storm will come” soundbite and it did so three days later, as United went down 2-0 at title-chasing Arsenal.",
      "Despite that defeat, hopes were high among United fans after their late smash-and-grab 2-1 derby win at local rivals Manchester City, but again they capitulated in their next league outing, humiliated 3-0 at home to Bournemouth three days before Christmas.",
      "United had to wait until January 16 for their next win, a 3-1 triumph over Southampton, but reverted to type three days later, going down 3-1 at home to Brighton. Subsequent wins came over Fulham, Ipswich, Leicester and Aston Villa in the final game of the season, but none were backed up by another triumph.",
      "Defender Luke Shaw was honest enough to admit United's lack of consistency has been their biggest failing, not just under Amorim, but his predecessors, and admitted the team have to start putting together winning runs if they want to start challenging towards the top end of the table again.",
      "Shaw, speaking after the Chelsea win, said: “We spoke about it a lot this week - winning this game, winning three points and moving on to the next. The standard we have to set is how we did in the first-half. It's about being consistent and maintaining the levels, not just for 30 minutes or 45 minutes. It's where we need to get to if we want to be a top, top team at the top of the league.",
      "“I felt like we were going to win. I think that's how we have to feel every game. We have to feel like we're going to go into the game and win. That doesn't matter who we play, home or away, we have to have that mentality every game – that we're going to win. We've got to go into games with that mindset.”",
      "Shaw was spot-on in his assessment of United and the mentality they need to develop if they are to become a successful team again. But actions speak louder than words and on Saturday in west London we will discover if Amorim's players can turn rhetoric into results and achieve back-to-back wins under him for the very first time.",

      "Of the five changes made by Ruben Amorin in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea, that of Harry Maguire was perhaps the most curious.",
      "Maguire, restored to United's starting line-up in the Premier League for the first time this season after three sub appearances, was replaced by Leny Yoro after 70 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim gave no specific reason afterwards for the change, but given it was Maguire's first start this season, it is safe to assume he was replaced to protect him from injury.",
      "Amorim has spoken often about the dangers players face in games when they enter the “red zone” and are more susceptible to injury, hence why he makes so many in-game defensive changes.",
      "Given Maguire was immense on Saturday in the centre of United's three-man defence, with Matthijs De Ligt and Luke Shaw equally impressive either side, those within the stadium were understandably puzzled by his withdrawal with 20 minutes plus added time remaining.",
      "But Amorim's thinking in making the switch was clearly to protect Maguire, who has surely now cemented his place in the United manager's first-choice back three, along with De Ligt on his right and Shaw on the left, after his rousing display against Chelsea.",
      "Yoro may have started all four of United's Premier League games until the weekend, but he struggled in the abject 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City the previous weekend, which is why Maguire came back into the starting line-up.",
      "Maguire's towering display, complemented by the equally dogged and disciplined performances of De Ligt and Shaw, makes it unlikely Amorim will want to change his three centre-backs for Saturday lunchtime's trip to Brentford.",
      "One Maguire moment on Saturday, as the swirling rain fell on a filthy night, drew nearly as big a cheer as both United goals. With five minutes to go until half-time, Maguire chased down a 50-50 ball with Chelsea's Joao Pedro and got to it first, sliding across the turf to send it emphatically out of play and clear the danger.",
      "The clearance drew a huge cheer from United fans, with the decibel level increased when Maguire picked himself back up off the turf and purposefully but subtly barged into Pedro as he ran to get back into position, sending a clear message to the Chelsea striker that he was not to be messed with.",
      "The aggressive clearance and belligerent barge into Pedro demonstrated Maguire's confidence on Saturday, something he has struggled with at times during his turbulent six-year United career, but which now looks restored, allowing him to produce his best form.",
      "Maguire's aggressive and focused approach was shared by De Ligt and Shaw, the former making a vital last-ditch clearance to block a cross with Chelsea pushing for an equaliser, the latter making an equally important recovery tackle on Andrey Santos to halt a dangerous breakaway late on.",
      "Before the Chelsea game, Maguire was presented with a framed shirt and pictures to mark his 250th appearance for United, which came with his substitute appearance in the derby loss at City six days earlier.",
      "The milestone underlines Maguire's enduring value and importance to United, despite his much-maligned status outside of the club. As well as his defensive reliability, Maguire has proved effective at the other end of the pitch, plundering 16 goals, including six in the 89th minute or later, three of them winners and one last-gasp equaliser.",
      "At a time when United need stability, aggression and balance at the back, Maguire's return to the side and his return to his imposing best could not have come at a better time as Amorim seeks to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking charge.",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

United were underwhelming in the Manchester derby, losing 3-0 to their fierce rivals. And, unsurprisingly after such a heavy loss, the critics were out in force to pick apart the Reds' failings.",

The former United captain insisted the full-back, who is currently being utilised in a three-man defence, 'gave up' allowing Phil Foden to score. Addressing those criticisms after defeating Chelsea a week later, Shaw admitted: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has sent his support to Jadon Sancho after the winger made his Premier League debut for Aston Villa on Sunday at Sunderland.",
      "Both Rashford and Sancho have been good friends since their time together with both United and England. The latter landed himself in hot water with the Reds' fanbase last season when he declared that Rashford was now 'free' after joining Villa on loan.",
      "The spell at Villa Park managed to revitalise Rashford and managed to earn him a season-long loan to Barcelona this season. At the beginning of the summer, the duo informed the Reds that they wished to leave the club.",
      "Sancho had been expected to join Chelsea permanently at the end of last season but he was returned to Old Trafford after failing to reach an agreement with Enzo Maresca's side on his wage. It has been claimed that the former Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund man contacted Rashford to discuss moving to Villa.",
      "Rashford is thought to have given the West Midlands club a glowing recommendation and the deal was completed at the start of this month. On Sunday, Sancho made his first appearance for Villa in the Premier League but it did not go according to plan as Unai Emery's side failed to beat 10-man Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on the fixture on Tuesday afternoon, Sancho wrote: \"Unfortunate not to get the win over the weekend, head up and go again to make things right!\" Rashford was quick to send his support to his former teammate, replying with a red heart emoji to the winger's message.",
      "Sancho will be hoping to receive further minutes for Villa on Thursday night when his new team host Bologna in their opening Europa League fixture of the season.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick reportedly requires treatment on an infection caught during a hospital stay after an injury to his right ankle.",
      "German media reports his extended stay is because of a 'serious' reason. However, Rangnick, who is now the manager of Austria, is still expected to be on the side-lines for their two World Cup qualifying matches in October.",
      "It's understood by German outlet BILD he underwent surgery at the trauma clinic in Murnau, Bavaria. They also claim he has caught a \"hospital-acquired germ\" which has to be \"treated with further measures.\"",
      "Rangnick is expected to remain in the hospital to undergo treatment on the infection. While he is expected to be well enough to manage Austria during the international break, he will reportedly not be present at their next squad announcement.",
      "Instead, it's been claimed his assistant manager Lars Kornetka will announce the squad for their next matches against San Marino and Romania on October 9 and October 12 respectively. As a result of the numerous surgeries to his ankle, Rangnick has found walking difficult and was seen cycling the distance between the dressing room and the bench during Austria's recent clash against Bosnia.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "£35",
      "Rangnick briefly managed United between December 2021 and May 2022, taking over from the sacked Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer after Michael Carrick had acted as caretaker manager. He was entrusted with overseeing 29 matches in all competitions, winning 11, drawing nine and losing nine.",
      "After his spell as interim manager, Rangnick was initially going to take on a consultancy role at the club, where he would tap into his experience from being director of football for the likes of RB Leipzig and other teams within the energy drink brand's umbrella.",
      "However, at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, the Reds released a statement confirming he would not be taking up his consultancy role at the club. He would go on to be appointed as manager of Austria not long after leaving Old Trafford.",
      "At Euro 2024, Austria were one of the most exciting teams in the group stages. After pushing France all the way before narrowly losing 1-0, they convincingly beat Poland 3-1 before overcoming the Netherlands 3-2.",
      "Their tournament was ended by a surprise defeat in the round of 16 to Turkey. On many occasions, Rangnick has opened up about his experience at the Red Devils before revealing his opinion on the current state of the club.",
      "In June, he told Sport: \"I think we have to go back to 2013, when Sir Alex left the club. At the time he was still there, he was the mastermind behind it all. He probably also brought a lot of important people to the club.",
      "\"The moment he left, some of those people probably left the club as well. And, since then, I think they have a leadership problem. Who's really making the decisions and why are they making them? Are they really the best people for the job?",
      "\"I can only tell you that the six months I was there, it was difficult to say, even for me as head coach. Who were the decision-makers? Who? Who could I talk to? If we wanted to sign new players, it was difficult. There were people, but in the end, it was difficult.\""

      "Casemiro's reliability for Manchester United has been questioned after his latest sending off for the Reds.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side edged out a nervy 2-1 win over Chelsea on Saturday in just their second victory of a disappointing season so far. Amorim's struggling side were indebted to Robert Sanchez's sending off, which led to United taking a 2-0 lead into half-time.",
      "But the Reds had a man sent off of their own before the break, with Casemiro receiving his marching orders after a second yellow card. The Brazilian's red card was his fourth in United colours and means that he will now miss Saturday's trip to Brentford through suspension.",
      "And former Southampton star Matt Le Tissier has offered his view on Casemiro's future under Amorim - sharing his belief that the former Real Madrid star could fall out of favour under the Portuguese.",
      "“I really feel like the manager is going to be looking at Casemiro now and thinking ‘can I trust you in the long-term?’ Certainly not too long-term as he is 33, but ‘can I trust you for the rest of this season in that important area of the field?'”, he said via Football Insider.",
      "“I think the answer is going to be…there is too many reds. He will find himself dropping down the pecking order at Manchester United. It will be interesting to see if he can get back into the team after he has served his latest suspension.”",
      "The decision to award Casemiro a second yellow card has been debated ever since referee Peter Bankes booked the United midfielder. But former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has explained why he believes the correct decision was made.",
      "\"The second one - people will say to me, 'Is it enough for a second yellow card?’ I am forever saying not every tackle after a yellow card is a second yellow card, but the difference here is he has deliberately gone to pull him back.",
      "\"We see every week, we are saying 'Everybody who is pulled back gets a second yellow card'. People say, 'He [Casemiro] got the ball’, he gets the ball because he pulls him [Santos] back. I think second yellow card, red card.\"",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Twenty-four years ago, almost to the day, I started covering Manchester United.",
      "The 2001-02 season was to be the last of Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious reign, having announced his intention to retire at the end of that campaign.",
      "A new manager would be installed and a new era would begin, for both United and myself. That was until Fergie's retirement U-turn at Christmas 2001, which saw him stay in charge for another 11 years, and with it for me came numerous run-ins with and bans from the man recognised as arguably the greatest manager of all time.",
      "Since Fergie retired in 2013, another five permanent managers – David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag – have tried and failed to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent boss to try to restore United to the status of champions, a task that seems more onerous than ever following last season's 15th-placed finish, the club's lowest for 51 years.",
      "But one thing I have learned, over nearly a quarter of a century of covering United, following them all over the world – Europe, America, Asia and South Africa – is that their global appeal is as strong as ever, even if they have failed to win the Premier League or Champions League for more than a decade.",
      "The old adage from United fans – 'Hated, adored, never ignored' – has never been more pertinent. In times of success, in times of crisis, no other team in the world comes close to matching United's enduring worldwide appeal, even in lean times such as now, as evidenced by the 75,000 fans who continue to fill Old Trafford every time they play.",
      "Covering a club of United's stature for so long has been a privilege, watching them play week in, week out, getting close up to and on first-name terms with some of the greatest managers and players of the modern era, not always seeing eye-to-eye with them, as is the nature of the business.",
      "I was in the tiny press conference room at United's training ground when Fergie flew into a rage over questions about Juan Sebastian Veron, cutting short his press conference and storming out, but not before delivering the infamous line: “Veron's a f****** great player, youse are f****** idiots!”",
      "Fergie may have been known for his legendary 'hairdryer' treatment, but there was a lighter side to him, such as the time the Mirror carried a front page story about the team's training sessions being filmed by a spy plane flying overhead.",
      "When I asked Fergie about the plane at the next press conference, he burst into laughter. “I saw you flying it,” joked Fergie, putting his hands upside down to impersonate a pair of flying goggles. “I could see you up there in your Biggles hat and goggles. Biggles McDonnell, Biggles of the Mirror!”",
      "Fergie's successor, Moyes, banned me from press conferences because I refused to stop leaking his starting line-ups, sometimes five or six hours before games, until he was dismissed before the end of his first season in charge of United.",
      "On the pitch, including Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, friendlies and pre-season matches, I reckon I have racked up more than 1,000 games covering United, and been privileged to be at some momentous occasions, including the 2008 Champions League final penalty shootout win over Chelsea in Moscow, where the relentless rain made it feel like home for the travelling United fans.",
      "Other highlights include United's epic derby duels with local rivals City, notably the 4-3 win for Fergie's side in 2009, which came courtesy of a dramatic 90th minute winner from Michael Owen, and not forgetting Wayne Rooney's stunning bicycle kick to beat the Blues 2-1 at the Theatre of Dreams two years later.",
      "I was also privileged to report on Rooney's United debut, back in 2004, when the then raw 18-year-old forward, who had taken Euro 2004 by storm, announced himself as a Red with a sublime hat-trick in a 6-2 win over Fenerbahce at Old Trafford, the first goals that would lead to him becoming the club's all-time leading scorer.",
      "As well as covering the highs for United over the past 24 years, there have also been some major lows, not least their 6-1 home defeat to City in 2011, the season in which the Blues went on to win the title from Fergie's men on goal difference on the final day.",
      "There were two Champions League final defeats to Pep Guardiola's peerless Barcelona and, more recently, with United mired in an ongoing identity crisis, many crushing losses, such as the 7-0 defeat to arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield two years ago under Ten Hag.",
      "But there is a reason United remain one of the biggest draws in world football, even when they have been unable to compete for major trophies in the past decade, and that is because of their rich history, stretching back to the Munich tragedy and the rebirth of the team under Sir Matt Busby, to the unprecedented era of success overseen by Ferguson.",
      "I hope to do the same as I begin this new chapter.",

      "The ball was so seldom in the Manchester United third in the first half that Altay Bayindir exercised to stay warm to ensure he would not be caught cold.",
      "A comedown of a second half should not overshadow the near-perfection United served up in the first. All but five minutes of it were played against ten men yet United had Chelsea on the back foot from the first whistle.",
      "The real United has turned up across their three home matches, each one more progressive than the previous. With this triumph they have laid down a marker against one of the Premier League's Champions League participants.",
      "United were eventually caught cold by Trevoh Chalobah's header from a corner. Substituting Harry Maguire a day after Amorim referenced Chelsea's threat from crosses felt remiss with a quarter of the match remaining.",
      "\"Seven!\" shrieked the United supporters at the number of added minutes in the second half. They celebrated the additional nine in the first half, back when victory seemed a formality. Yet this is a club that feels like it is obliged to quicken the heart rate of its supporters.",
      "\"Oh United, we love you,\" roared their supporters as the clock ticked towards the 97th minute. Amorim paced nervously around the technical area, glanced at his staff and issued the odd instruction. United held on.",
      "This has to be the turning point in United's season. They were better than Chelsea in every conceivable department, from the stands to the pitch. United supporters belted out 'Take Me Home' with more gusto than ever since its introduction shortly before kick-off. The players fed off the atmosphere, enhanced by the evening kick-off time.",
      "United used the Mancunian rain to their advantage. Benjamin Sesko's flick on skidded perfectly into the path of Bryan Mbeumo and Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez fell into the trap. The Chelsea analysts had issues connecting to the network. It was soon Sanchez who malfunctioned.",
      "The Stretford End was so buoyed by Sanchez's fifth-minute red card they aired Amorim's chant before United scored. Bruno Fernandes got the goal a mere nine minutes later.",
      "There was more biblical rain at Old Trafford but Amorim's ark has not flooded. He will not be the second Premier League manager to be sacked this season. That is bound to be Graham Potter.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was United's catalyst in his best game yet for his new club. He went close to scoring before Sanchez's expulsion and earned a standing ovation when Matheus Cunha was ready to replace him. Amorim had a rethink and Mbeumo stayed on. He elicited a second round of applause when he eventually made way minutes later.",
      "The winger's importance is such that Fernandes, usually in his element ordering new teammates around, was borderline deferential towards Mbeumo during the electric first half. Mbeumo's name was chanted by the Stretford End as he headed back to the dugout, his route doubling as a lap of honour. Amorim clasped hands and patted his head.",
      "United fans put their hands together twice for Maguire, too. He was presented with a commemorative shirt to mark his 250th appearance before the game and the United defence was better off with him back on his first Premier League start of the campaign. Maguire only made way midway through the second half to manage his workload, a costly change.",
      "This was an evening United supporters could scarcely have believed when the teamsheets were printed. Amorim picked seven defensive players in a must-win home game. Alas, United seldom defended. Their first half was one of their most accomplished and pleasing until Casemiro reignited a contest against a seemingly condemned Chelsea.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui embarked on his own celebration after Casemiro made it 2-0 and received a hug from Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes. More bonhomie seemed inevitable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was instructed to warm up after Casemiro was booked in the 17th minute. Mainoo was the only substitute limbering up, a sure sign Amorim and his staff knew Casemiro would not last the duration.",
      "Casemiro has walked a tightrope before and got away with it. Erik ten Hag hooked him at half-time against Luton two seasons ago after he was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card. Casemiro could not hold his nerve until half-time as he cynically halted Andrey Santos' getaway.",
      "Fernandes' position has been disputed regularly and here he was arriving late to connect with Patrick Dorgu's header. The linesman called it impeccably by keeping his flag down as only Fernandes' arm was offside. A Chelsea analyst, optimistic that they had a case for offside, smacked his hand against his forehead upon the final outcome.",
      "This was another inspirational effort from Fernandes. Shortly before his removal, he embarked on a superhuman run and unleashed a testing shot that was parried by Filip Jorgensen. Fernandes immediately turned to the Stretford End and implored them to continue with their backing. They obliged.",
      "Fernandes was back on the pitch at full-time, pointing out to Manuel Ugarte and Patrick Dorgu where they went wrong. The United captain's mentality remains unmatched.",
      "United have rarely had a better first 20 minutes on their own patch. They were a man up and soon a goal up. Then Cole Palmer became Chelsea's third substitution, enforced by injury. Palmer chucked his gloves on the floor, claimed a coat and skulked down the tunnel. \"City reject,\" crowed the United supporters. Palmer re-emerged with a bag of ice against his thigh.",
      "Only a handful of former United players are booed on their return at Old Trafford and it cannot be a coincidence that four of them are Argentinian. Alejandro Garnacho copped it before kick-off and the Stretford End dusted off its old ditty about Carlos Tevez that starts with \"Who's that t**t from Argentina.\" The Chelsea contingent vainly chanted \"Viva Garnacho\".",
      "Garnacho was ordered to warm up in the 53rd minute and received an embrace from Kobbie Mainoo on his approach to the Stretford End. Garnacho had the nerve to run past the corner flag and observe some caustic sign language.",
      "Garnacho's bleached barnet was distinguishable before he pulled his hood up when he emerged for kick-off. The focus was soon off him when Sanchez upended Mbeumo. Garnacho never got off the bench.",
      "He stayed in the cold.",

      "Altay Bayindir has started in all four of United's Premier League matches this term, having arrived for £4.3m from Fenerbahce as back-up to Andre Onana on deadline day in September 2023.",
      "United allowed Onana to join Trabzonspor on a season-long loan earlier this month, leaving them without a clear and obvious first-choice 'keeper.",
      "When asked whether Bayindir was the new United number one, Amorim replied: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place.",
      "\"Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place. I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko is yet to break his duck for United after five games. Sesko made his full league debut in the 3-0 loss at City after failing to score in two starts for Slovenia in their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "The 22-year-old was the tenth outfield player to take a penalty in the 12-11 shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round, though he was suffering from cramp at the end of the 90 minutes.",
      "Sesko said during the international break he needed time at United. The former RB Leipzig striker is three months younger than his predecessor, Rasmus Hojlund, who managed three goals in his final 35 appearances for United before he joined Napoli on loan.",
      "United have had the most attempts at goal in the Premier League this season, have hit the woodwork more times than any other team and Bruno Fernandes has created more chances than any other player.",
      "Amorim acknowledged that Sesko was too isolated in the derby. \"I think, if you remember Arsenal, I think we missed a lot. Burnley, I think we missed a lot. Fulham in the beginning, I think we missed a lot. We have four games and I said three.",
      "\"And then there is the thing that you say is not a big opportunity. The first play (against City), Amad has the ball between the lines. It's four against three and we put the ball out. It's not a big opportunity. It should be. So all these things.",
      "\"But if you ask me, against City, Sesko looks like he's alone in the box, I agree. He was always alone. So the guys were around, near the box. But in the final third, we get there many times.",
      "\"But I also said that, I think, in the end of the game. When I look at the box, Ben was alone. We cannot score in that way. So I think it's not the same team in that department compared to last year.",
      "\"He's at a different club. He's taking it all in and he's a professional. So you can feel that. He wants everything for tomorrow and we have to balance that.",
      "\"But he's doing the job. And again, guys, we can talk about all the things here. The system: if one ball goes inside the box, we win one game and two, this will change.",
      "\"The important thing is that last year, I said to you, I think I was really clear: we cannot play well. We cannot create chances. This year is completely different. We can avoid all the goals that we are suffering. Yes, it's our fault. So let's work on that and try next week and next week and next week.\"",

      "Not even two years have passed since Alejandro Garnacho scored a sensational overhead kick to power Manchester United to a 3-0 victory over Everton.",
      "The strike was a goal of season winner as soon as it crashed into the net and at that stage it seemed the winger was destined to have a key role for years to come at Old Trafford.",
      "Six months later he scored in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City and his future at United seemed as bright as his wonder goal.",
      "Yet this weekend he will trot out at Old Trafford in the blue of Chelsea having found himself ostracised by Ruben Amorim at United. He's gone from being talked about as having United parallels with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, to being discarded having trained with a 'bomb squad'.",
      "Amorim did not even want to talk about him in his pre-match press conference and it is clear the head coach did not value the Argentina international, who criticised the manager's decision to omit him from the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "That was the final straw in a tormented relationship between the pair and from that moment on it was a case of when the 21-year-old would leave, not if.",
      "Chelsea were long-term admirers and swooped in the closing days of the transfer window. The Blues considered the £40million fee a bargain price given Garnacho's ability, experience and high ceiling, and wanted additional competition for Jamie Gittens on the left flank.",
      "He's made only two substitute appearances since his move but could start against United. Blues boss Enzo Maresca has spoken positively of Garnacho and he played a part in Moises Caicedo's goal against Brentford last time out.",
      "The questions over his attitude while at United are not a concern at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea reporter for Football London, Bobby Vincent, pointed to the comparison between Garnacho and Jadon Sancho, who spent last season on loan at the club from United, as evidence of the Blues being able to get the best out of mercurial players.",
      "\"Like all things, it (his attitude) would have been considered when Chelsea were initially exploring a move for him,\" he said. \"Maresca worked with Jadon Sancho last season, who had similar complaints surrounding him, but from what I understand, Sancho worked really well during his time at Chelsea and the club were impressed with the winger's work ethic and professionalism.\"",
      "Yet Garnacho still has some work to do to win over the supporters, with Vincent adding: \"The fans are very much still split on his signing. It seems, though, most of them were encouraged by his cameo in Brentford. He has plenty to prove to the fans - let's put it that way.\"",
      "He will have plenty to prove to himself, too, particularly on his return to Manchester on Saturday evening.",
      "One man who knew him well coming through the ranks at Old Trafford was former United Under-21 boss Neil Wood.",
      "\"Garna' has got talent, some of the choices he has done off the pitch might have not helped him,\" said Wood, when speaking to the MEN earlier this year. \"A bit of immaturity maybe, but it is a shame to see it. A couple of those things can be easily stopped, whether it is a bit of education.",
      "\"He is not a bad lad or a bad guy but his choices have not helped him. He needs to get back to concentrating on his football and let that do the talking.\"",
      "We will see who has the last word come Saturday night.",

      "Amorim was reassured by Ratcliffe that his position is still secure. Amorim is under contract at United until the summer of 2027.",
      "The United head coach also discussed the state of play at the club with chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. Amorim opined that United \"are playing well until the boxes\".",
      "\"New contract, he was offering me a new contract!\" Amorim joked. \"No, it’s normal things just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project.",
      "\"He said many times this is my first season. For me, it’s not. But normal things. I spoke with him, with Omar, with Jason, just trying to see all the data around the team. A normal meeting and we had several. But in this moment, it’s normal people pay attention to that.",
      "\"This is the club with the most pressure in the world. We want to win and, again, you can say whatever. I think last year I was very critical of the way we play. I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes, we need to be more clinical, the rest we are improving compared to last year, we are in a better place.",
      "\"We need to win. We lost against Arsenal and we lost against City. Here, losing especially in the beginning after last year, is a problem.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and to analyse the next game and to prepare different things. I think we are playing well until we reach the boxes. If you see the number of shots, the XG, all these things are good, but you don’t score it doesn’t mater. You don’t win games.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games, we just have to maintain the way we are playing but improving on the opponent’s box and our box.",
      "\"Especially against Chelsea. When they cross they have more guys inside the box and we suffer a little bit against Fulham. We work a lot during the week to be better on that.",
      "\"It’s always the same cycle. To analyse what we did wrong at the weekend and to improve the next week.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United \"complicate our lives every time\" after the win against Chelsea.",
      "United were handed an advantage just minutes into the contest against Chelsea when goalkeeper Roberto Sanchez was sent off.",
      "Sanchez fouled Bryan Mbeumo and received his marching orders. Bruno Fernandes then opened the scoring for United and Casemiro extended the lead with a headed goal in the 37th minute.",
      "United were cruising to the interval against 10-man Chelsea, but Casemiro was shown a second yellow card just before the break. Chelsea set up a nervous end to the game when Trevoh Chalobah scored with 10 minutes remaining, but United defended bravely to secure a 2-1 victory.",
      "Speaking at his post-match press conference, Amorim said of the win: \"It was really important. I think we deserved it. But we complicate our lives every time. I think we started the game really well, with the aggression and showing the opponent we were there.",
      "\"Of course, the sending off for the goalkeeper helped us a lot, but we were in control, scored two goals. And with everything going well, we complicated it with the sending off.",
      "\"The second half, I think we managed well, but in the end like the last 15 minutes was tough for us. They scored a goal, we suffered together and we managed to win.",
      "\"I think the players showed that [desire], but we also showed when everything is going well, we do something to make it difficult. But again, just the way we start the game, the first and second ball, I remember when we scored the first one we had many situations, three against one, three against two, goalkeeper outside of the box, with the last pass we are not being perfect in that moment.",
      "\"And that can help us a lot to control the games and to win games, but we suffer together in the end and that was a good thing. If you look at the game, we deserved to win.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he saw the \"aggression\" that he discussed in his pre-match press conference and said: \"I think if we try to remember the game, you can feel it, especially in the beginning. It's 11 vs 11 and I don't remember the big player we did. It's not about that in this moment.",
      "\"It's about the second ball, the first ball, the aggression and speed. Even Casa' with the sending off, he was really aggressive. Of course, he needs to do better in that moment, but we show today we wanted to win really, really bad.\"",
      "When asked about complicating the game, Amorim responded: \"That they [the players] are trying to do things a little bit too much, making a tackle that maybe we shouldn't? It's hard to say, because that is the pressure.",
      "\"The guy [Casemiro] has five Champions League. I feel more pressure in some young guys sometimes. But maybe it's because Casemiro cares. We score one and he has that tackle.",
      "\"And then they had maybe one time that they passed half of the pitch and we want to win the ball right away. So I think sometimes it's not the pressure, they wanted too much in that moment. That is not a bad thing.\"",
      "Amorim said on Friday he would not change formation even if the Pope asked him to. \"I was a joking,\" laughed Amorim. \"And you like it guys, so don't complain. You love it that way. Let's try to win the next one and I will give you another one.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim suggested even the Pope could not change him to pick a different formation.",
      "Amorim has used the 3-4-2-1 system in all 47 matches he has taken charge of at United but the team have won only eight out of 31 in the Premier League.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe visited United's Carrington training complex on Thursday but there was no puff of white smoke. Ratcliffe reassured Amorim after a galling start to the season in which United have won one of their five matches and were humiliatingly eliminated from the League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim will continue to use the 3-4-2-1 system he swears by in United's Premier League home fixture against Chelsea on Saturday night and clarified he does not intend to change United's shape now.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim replied when asked if the formation was mentioned with Ratcliffe. \"No one, not even the Pope will change… This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.",
      "\"But I will change the system, there will be an evolution, but we need to make all the good steps. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure, it doesn't matter if he's all around the world, is saying, 'you need to change the system' and I'm going to change in this moment, they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"So, everything, when you think about the impact that any decision is going to have on the team, everything is important. So, I will say the same thing: this will have an evolution. I'm doing things my way. Some guys do it in a different way.",
      "\"But it will change. So, I hope to have the time to change! But it will change.\"",
      "Amorim expressed encouragement at United's performance progression, citing their second-place status for the expected goals metric. United are first for most attempts at goal and efforts that have hit the woodwork in the Premier League.",
      "However, United have scored one goal from open play in six hours in the league so far this term. Apart from Bryan Mbeumo's second-half strike against Burnley, United have scored two own goals and Bruno Fernandes converted an added-time penalty to beat Burnley.",
      "Champions Liverpool have won all five of their league and Champions League games with a goal scored in the last ten minutes or in added time. Amorim feels Liverpool have the belief United are lacking.",
      "\"I think it's everything,\" he opined. \"It's belief. It's confidence. It's aggression. It's everything. And sometimes, what we call luck is the way we play the game with more belief.",
      "\"So I think it's Liverpool. It's winning all the games. It's something about the teams that are winning that something is going to happen, to have that feeling. And sometimes, with us, I feel the opposite. We are playing well, but something is going to go wrong in some moments.",
      "So, we need to change that, but it's just with wins. I can do whatever. They can do whatever. But, if you look at the goals against City, Fulham, all these moments, we scored against Burnley. We are good in the game and then we take the draw.",
      "\"All these moments, I think we can do better. It's our fault. So, we work on that during the week to improve for the next.\"",
      "Amorim was fleetingly linked with a return to Lisbon as Benfica manager early in the week. Reports in Portugal suggested Benfica presidential candidate João Noronha Lopes was keen on bringing Amorim in to replace Bruno Lage, who was sacked after the Champions League defeat to Qarabag in midweek.",
      "Instead, incumbent Benfica president Rui Costa appointed Amorim's mentor and former United manager, Jose Mourinho, as Lage's replacement. Former Sporting coach Amorim clarified that there was no contact with Benfica and that whenever he leaves United he will require a break.",
      "\"No guys, no contact,\" Amorim added. \"I'm Manchester United manager. Until something changes, and after that, for sure, if it's next month, tomorrow, in ten years, I will rest because I deserve it.",
      "\"So, no contact, not so ever. And then Mourinho is there. So guys, if you want, you will have fun!\"",

      "The head coach was still strongly backed in the summer, with Man Utd spending over £200m on new signings, most notably revamping their attack with the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After spending big, the Red Devils turned their attention to outgoings in the final weeks of the window.",

      "READ: Man Utd told to get Southgate ‘in to restructure the whole place’ at Amorim’s expense",
      "There was intense chatter over his future after he was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games, with clubs ranging from Real Madrid to Tottenham linked. But the hierarchy, led by INEOS’ Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had no desire to let the England midfielder leave on loan.",
      "Since then, Mainoo has had limited minutes: 45 off the bench against Burnley, 28 against Manchester City, three against Chelsea, and the full Carabao Cup second-round defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has previously boiled p*ss by saying Mainoo is competing for Bruno Fernandes’ position in the team, rather than competing with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to play next to the Man Utd captain.",
      "Fernandes is not getting dropped, especially in his current form, and with Ugarte failing to impress and Casemiro suspended after his red card against Chelsea, the clamour to see Mainoo start is growing even stronger.",
      "But spending a club-record fee on Baleba would all but nail Mainoo’s Old Trafford coffin shut. While Baleba’s arrival might excite fans, their academy graduate is the last player they want sacrificed to make it happen.",
      "From a boardroom perspective, Mainoo can be sold for pure profit, a godsend for the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which only makes his potential departure more appealing.",
      "The prospect of losing him has already angered supporters, and if Football Insider is right that Man Utd will try again for Baleba in January, then the club are effectively willing to shove Mainoo out, whether deliberately or as collateral damage.",
      "The report in question states:",
      "Sources say that Ruben Amorim’s side are likely to go back in for the 21-year-old in January, and that speculation will increase again in the new year.",
      "However, United would struggle to complete a deal during the mid-season window due to Brighton’s reluctance to sell, and would have a better chance of signing the youngster next summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at over £100m… Despite this, the speculation is playing into the Red Devils’ hands, with the Cameroon international suffering a poor start to the season amid claims that his head has been turned.",
      "Indeed, Baleba’s head might well have been turned by the struggling Red Devils, and Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler suggested as much after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "“Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he’s a very young player,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“It’s all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there’s interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying, ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "“It’s even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.”",
      "Man Utd are prepared to allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in the January transfer window on one condition, according to reports.",

      "Manchester United have been told to sack Ruben Amorim and bring in Gareth Southgate by Teddy Sheringham who believes the ex-England boss can “restructure the whole place.”",
      "Southgate has not taken up another job since leaving the England post in July 2024 but Sheringham is not the first to link the former Middlesbrough boss with the United gig.",
      "The 55-year-old was said to be high up on Jim Ratcliffe’s shortlist back in March 2025 when the minority owner was considering sacking Erik ten Hag. An FA Cup win gave Ten Hag a stay of execution but when it came round to appointing his replacement in November, they opted for Ruben Amorim.",
      "But with the Portuguese under increasing pressure, plenty of pundits like Sheringham have been telling their former club just how to fix the problem.",
      "The former striker’s solution is to sack Amorim and bring in Southgate, suggesting the way he turned England around could be done with United.",
      "“If you look at some of the high-profile managers who have been at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson left, a lot of them have come in and unsuccessfully tried to take the club forward in their own way,” he told Coin Poker.",
      "“I know some United fans had reservations over Gareth Southgate due to his style of play, but having looked at what he achieved with England, he could be the man to steady the ship at Old Trafford.",
      "“Manchester United are the pinnacle of English football, and I think Southgate will understand the enormity of the task having been the manager of England for eight years.",

      "“He’d understand the pressure that would come with the task and he’d be in a better place to take on the mantle of getting United back to where they belong. I don’t want to see Ruben Amorim or any other manager lose his job, but you could do a lot worse than getting Gareth in to restructure the whole place.”",
      "Southgate has previously said he is in “no rush” to return to club management having last done so in 2009.",
      "“Sometimes when you are in a big role you don’t realise the weight until it’s gone,” Southgate said at the European Club Association’s general assembly in October. “It is one of those jobs where everybody has an opinion.",
      "“I am enjoying my life so there is no rush. For 11 years I committed fully to the national federation. I won’t coach in the next year for sure. I am certain of that. When you come out of a big role you need to give your body time, your mind time.”",

The existence of this higher offer puts Barca and, above all, Deco in a delicate situation. While the 30 million clause gives Barca an advantage, it also means that Deco and the board must decide whether to activate this option or negotiate with PSG.’",
      "Rashford has already been punished for missing a team meeting with Hansi Flick deciding to put him on the bench for their 3-0 win over Getafe at the weekend.",

      "Forget Kylian Mbappe or Lamine Yamal, if Ousmane Dembele winning this year’s Ballon d’Or tells us anything, it is that the era of predictability is over.",
      "While in previous years, organisers could be pretty sure the big golden ball was going to either Messi or Ronaldo, four different winners in the last four seasons suggest the Ballon d’Or is now impossible to predict.",
      "That fact could not be demonstrated more beautifully than by the example of Dembele, who appeared to be wasted potential following his departure from Barcelona but has instead scooped the shiniest individual gong in world football.",
      "With that in mind, we are getting out the crystal ball to give you six left-field predictions of players who could win the award next year.",
      "",
      "Harry Kane tends to grab the headlines whenever Bayern do well – which they usually do – but one of their best-performing players is Michael Olise.",
      "Transferring from the Premier League is not always easy – just look at Sadio Mane – but a first season in Germany saw him contribute 30 combined goals and assists in 34 Bundesliga appearances.",
      "The French international has started this season strongly too, scoring three and assisting two in four league games so far and at 23, can only get better. So much better that Liverpool are already said to be sniffing around as they scout for a long-term replacement for Mo Salah.",
      "Bayern have won just one Champions League in the past 12 years and should they double that tally this season, you get the sense that the former Crystal Palace winger will be key to that. And then there’s the small matter of France at the World Cup.",
      "",
      "There is nothing like a Barcelona midfielder to whet the nostalgic appetite but while plenty of have been dubbed the new Andres Iniesta or Xavi, Pedri seems the likeliest candidate to actually reach that level.",
      "Against Newcastle, he put in a masterclass of a midfield performance and while the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha may score the goals, Pedri ensures the team behind them ticks along nicely.",
      "But, Pedri need only ask Iniesta and Xavi when it comes to midfield players not being fairly represented at the Ballon d’Or. Rodri, Luka Modric and Kaka are the only midfielders to win it this century but what does work in Pedri’s favour is that he does not have Lionel Messi blocking his path.",
      "It is also a World Cup year with Spain one of the favourites for next summer’s tournament.",
      "",
      "The Ballon d’Or went to Paris this year and there is every chance it does again next season, only this time it could be going to Kvaratskhelia.",
      "The Georgian was already impressive when he featured at Napoli but a move to PSG in January propelled him into the limelight and he played nine times in the French club’s Champions League-winning run.",
      "In Luis Enrique, he has a manager who can get the best out of him and while Dembélé will be once again one of the favourites should PSG repeat their Treble trick, Kvaratskhelia could steal the spotlight.",
      "",
      "There is nothing like leaving Manchester United to restart your career and Marcus Rashford appears to be the latest beneficiary.",
      "Having held out for a dream move to Barcelona, Rashford has so far made the most of his opportunity and looks more like the player who burst onto the scene at Old Trafford rather than the one we saw in later years.",
      "Rashford’s main challenge is the players ahead of him with Yamal and Raphinha being near undroppable but two excellent goals against Newcastle will have done his chances the world of good.",
      "More of that and Rashford may be nominated for the Ballon d’Or for the first time in his career.",

      "Okay so hear us out on this one but there is a timeline where De Bruyne could be holding the shiny golden ball this time next year.",
      "Yes we know he’s 34 and arguably past his best but making an ageing player look like a world-beater is Serie A’s premium jam.",
      "Two goals in four matches as well as his form at the end of last season show De Bruyne is not a busted flush and there is a real chance that Napoli have a very good campaign ahead of them.",
      "Antonio Conte’s side are favourites for the league and could be a Champions League dark horse even if their campaign began with a defeat at De Bruyne’s old stomping ground.",
      "Let’s not forget that the Ballon d’Or is anot decided by robots but instead humans who can very much be swayed by sentimentality (see Messi in 2023). If Napoli do go deep, could we see a world where De Bruyne, who has only been in the top three once, is given the gong? Unlikely but yes we can.",
      "",
      "Just four English players in history have ever got their hands on the Ballon d’Or, but you have to go back to 2001 and Michael Owen for the last winner from the country that invented the sport.",
      "While the likes of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard came close in 2005 and Wayne Rooney somehow never made the top three, this current generation appears to have a much better chance of breaking the 24-year drought.",
      "Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice made it to the top 30 while Cole Palmer was somehow eighth, but in terms of the 2026 award, you get the feeling that Harry Kane is the best candidate.",
      "While there are question marks over whether the other three will win the league this year, we can say with almost certainty that Bayern will triumph this campaign, and the German giants are tipped to be one of the strongest contenders in this year’s Champions League.",
      "And there is the World Cup to consider. Thomas Tuchel has been brought in with one goal in mind and that is immediate success, and Kane is very much central to that.",
      "At 32, this will be his final World Cup in his peak, and a good club season followed by a World Cup-winning summer may see Kane join the list of Owen, Keegan, Charlton, Law and Matthews.",

      "Man Utd could reportedly be in for an unexpected boost in the transfer market next summer with PSG willing to offer more than Barcelona for Marcus Rashford.",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has hit out at Marcus Rashford over his behaviour at Old Trafford and for new club Barcelona.",
      "Erling Haaland is rapidly closing in on Kevin de Bruyne for Manchester City Premier League goals against the Big Six, with an obvious leader in front.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them."

      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has hit out at Marcus Rashford over his behaviour at Old Trafford and for new club Barcelona.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Premier League rivals Aston Villa but Unai Emery’s side decided not to take up the option to make the deal permanent.",
      "It was clear in January that his time at Man Utd, at least under Ruben Amorim, was coming to an end with the head coach claiming he’d rather start his goalkeeping coach over Rashford.",
      "And over the summer Barcelona agreed to take Rashford on a loan deal until the end of the season with an option in his contract to buy for around £26m.",
      "After having a mixed start to his time at the Camp Nou, Rashford exploded into life in their Champions League match against Newcastle with a brace in a 2-1 win.",
      "But there have already been signs of some unprofessionalism from Rashford at Barcelona with Hansi Flick omitting him from the starting XI for their 3-0 win over Getafe after he turned up late for a team meeting.",
      "READ: A title race! Gyokeres! Bournemouth! Potter! Top 10 things we’ve already got wrong this season",
      "It is a mistake he also made during his time at Old Trafford with Rashford dropped to the bench by Erik ten Hag in 2022 against Wolves for oversleeping, before he came on to score the winning goal.",
      "And Scholes admits he has a hard time feeling happy for Rashford with the Man Utd academy graduate not giving his all during his final days at Old Trafford.",
      "Scholes said on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: “I really struggle to feel happy for Marcus Rashford.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful. The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave… His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.",
      "“I think he quit on Man Utd. When you quit once, you’ll quit again. He was late last night [for Barcelona].",
      "“He wont get away with that for long at Barca. There’s absolutely no chance. How can you sleep in these days? Your phone, f*****g alarm, whatever. How can you sleep in?",
      "“He’s definitely got the talent to be [one of the best players in the world]. But he’ll never have the mentality.”",
      "After going out in Belfast in January 2024 before calling in sick for Man Utd training, Rashford defended himself in The Players’ Tribune as he’s become a media target.",
      "Rashford said: “I think some of it goes back to the [coronavirus] pandemic. I was just trying to use my voice to make sure that kids weren’t going hungry, because I know exactly how it feels.",
      "“For some reason, that seemed to rub certain people the wrong way. It seems like they’ve been waiting for me to have a human moment so they can point the finger and say, ‘See? See who he really is?’ – listen, I’m not a perfect person.",
      "“When I make a mistake, I’ll be the first one to put my hand up and say that I need to do better.”",

      "It’s only September and we’ve all already got so much wrong about this season, from expecting an actual real-life title race like damn fools, to expecting the promoted teams to just meekly surrender as has become the style of our times.",
      "We feared for Bournemouth, like massive idiots, we thought Graham Potter just needed a pre-season, like even massiver idiots. We thought Man United would be a bit less sh*t this time.",
      "We thought Viktor Gyokeres would either fire Arsenal to the title or flop hard and the awkward bugger isn’t going to do either of those things.",
      "And let’s not even start on that ‘Chelsea title challenge’ we all talked about after the Trump World Cup.",
      "As always, you can see our pre-season predictions in full here. Laugh hard.",
      "",
      "So angry about this one already. Can’t fault Liverpool, can we? They’re doing their bit. Could hardly have looked more vulnerable if they’d tried, could they? But they’ve still accidentally won all their games despite falling entirely asleep the very moment they take a 2-0 lead.",
      "Meanwhile nobody else can even be bothered. Mikel Arteta is as timid as a tiny mouse with a suspiciously full head of hair, Pep Guardiola is cosplaying Jose Mourinho sufferball for reasons we simply cannot fathom, and Chelsea… well, we’ve got more to say about them later.",
      "Look, it’s obviously very early to be writing off the entire title race, and the main reason people are keen to do so now is in the hope they can call Liverpool bottle jobs later. They are objectively the worst very good team in Premier League history, and a lot of the teams who are better than them at this stage didn’t actually go on to win the league.",
      "But with everyone else shambling about to one extent or other and the sure and certain knowledge that Liverpool are only going to get better as they all get to know each other, it does appear like the best opportunity anyone else had to knock Liverpool off their perch this season was in these early weeks.",
      "It hasn’t happened, either through Liverpool dropping points or anyone else looking much like taking advantage if and when they do. And now it probably won’t happen. The sheer extent to which Arsenal already appear certain to finish second is truly extraordinary. World-class commitment to the bit.",
      "",
      "He is already the Premier League’s most fascinating player. Incredibly awkward, almost sarcastically un-Arsenal, and entirely incapable of fashioning or creating anything for himself, which means that in the big games where Arteta’s instinct is always going to be safety-first, Gyokeres isn’t going to get a kick. Like he didn’t against United, like he didn’t against Liverpool, like he didn’t against City.",
      "",
      "But what Gyokeres does have is an uncanny ability to stick the ball in the net. So in the games where Arteta takes off the handbrake – which across the course of the season will be a far higher percentage of games than has been the case in Arsenal’s undeniably difficult start – he’ll score a whole bunch of goals.",
      "It won’t stop people calling him a massive flop, because a lot of people seem weirdly invested in the idea of Gyokeres as a massive flop. The discourse around him is very strange, perhaps because he is such an awkward-looking player to watch. Nothing about the way he plays football screams £60m superstar in the way it does with, say, a Hugo Ekitike.",
      "He’s going to score loads of goals against all the teams that aren’t brilliant. So he’s not going to be a massive flop. Even now, the only Premier League player with more goals this season than Gyokeres is literally Erling Haaland.",
      "He is, though, going to get called a massive flop because he ‘hasn’t delivered in the big games’. He’s going to be labelled a ‘flat-track bully’ (like literally here). He’s going to be told he hasn’t done enough to shift the needle, because obviously there was no evidence last season that Arsenal might have benefited from someone to consistently score goals against teams like Bournemouth or West Ham or Newcastle or Everton or Brentford or Nottingham Forest or Aston Villa or Brighton or Crystal Palace or Fulham or, well, you get the idea with that.",
      "Above all, though, he’s going to be labelled a flop despite scoring 23 Premier League goals.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola, we owe you an apology, we weren’t really familiar with your game. We should have been, because he’s been performing minor Premier League miracles for a good while now with Bournemouth.",
      "But this is surely his greatest trick yet. Having built last season’s considerable success on the strength of his back five, Iraola has now seen four of that five stolen away by assorted members of European football’s collection of big bastards. Huijsen went to Real Madrid. Zabarnyi to PSG. Kerkez to Liverpool. And, to a lesser extent, Kepa to Arsenal.",
      "That was more than enough to place Bournemouth in the large pile of similarly asset-stripped smaller clubs about whom we had significant fear.",
      "We should have had more faith, because what Iraola has done is simply instantly build another brilliant team built on another excellent defence.",
      "A Spurs team that has scored at least twice in each of its four other Premier League games this season could barely muster a meaningful chance across 90 minutes where the sheer extent of the Cherries’ total control of proceedings was almost eerie.",
      "And that was no one-off fluke. Only Liverpool have more points after five games than a team that should by rights have been thoroughly broken by the events of the summer.",
      "And only Liverpool have beaten them, after a ding-dong opening-night battle at Anfield. Bournemouth conceded four goals that night, but have shipped only one since and an upcoming fixture list featuring Leeds, Fulham, Palace and Forest between now and the end of next month offers serious scope for continued defying of Premier League gravity.",
      "Right now they are Champions League-bound and it doesn’t even feel daft.",
      "",
      "Sure, it was often very bad indeed in those closing months of last season, but patience was needed. Potter is a details man, who needed to imprint his ideas and methods on to a squad not without its charms.",
      "As it turns out, he didn’t need that at all. What Graham Potter in fact needed was a time machine to go back to the day he took the Chelsea job and punch his past self squarely in the face and talk him out of committing career suicide.",
      "We’re almost certain there is now no chance Potter can save himself at West Ham specifically. It’s just too f*cked. What’s really wild, though, given where he was just a few short years ago is that we’re really not at all sure now how he goes about saving his career at all.",
      "Seriously, think about it. When the inevitable happens and the axe falls and West Ham appoint Gary O’Neil or Nuno to try and do just enough to avoid the ignominy of relegation, where does Potter go next? What’s his next step? Who takes a chance on him, and would he be at all interested in the sort of club that would do that anyway?",
      "He might be even more screwed in this equation than West Ham themselves, and that’s a club currently in some of the deepest despair we’ve ever seen, with a fanbase apparently only now able to agree on what they don’t want rather than what they do.",
      "That’s especially inconvenient because among those things are a terrible stadium and terrible owners that they appear rather stuck with.",
      "If you ask us, it all started to go wrong the moment the entire club tried for some reason we’ve never really understood to gaslight us all into pretending their previous much less soulless stadium had always been widely known as the Boleyn Ground and that nobody had ever called it Upton Park, actually.",
      "Seriously, why did they do that? What was the point?",
      "",
      "They won the Club World Cup! And to a less noteworthy degree the Europa Conference! They bought a load of good players again! And sold a lot of rubbish at very decent prices! But still forgot to sign an actual goalkeeper! Which is costing them really badly! And forcing Enzo Maresca to make the single worst collection of substitutions in any Premier League match ever!",
      "Ah, well. An undignified scrap with Spurs et al for fourth it shall be, then. And probably a managerial change as well. He’s just too bald.",
      "",
      "The Barclays giveth and the Barclays taketh away. While the Our League Gods have again, in their infinite wisdom, not deemed it fit to grant us a Proper Title Race they are seemingly going to grant us a good old-fashioned relegation ding-dong after all that promoted-and-immediately-relegated drudgery of the last two years.",
      "Two things were required to make this happen. Some of the Settled Seventeen looking a bit cack, and the promoted trio showing signs of competence.",
      "Happily, we have both. Even Burnley haven’t been entirely wretched, and along with Leeds and Sunderland they have now amassed 19 points from 15 games at 1.27 per game. It’s already pretty much a third of the total points tally the promoted-relegated trio managed last season at 0.57 points per game.",
      "Lovely stuff. And then throw in the catastrophic awfulness of Wolves, West Ham and even Aston Villa, with high potential for your Brentfords or even Nottingham Forests to get themselves into strife and we’ve got ourselves a proper scrap for survival.",
      "",
      "Worth its own section for the sheer scale of its wrongness. But accustomed as we’d come to seeing promoted sides struggle horribly and armed with the fact that Sunderland looked like a textbook example of a team committing the disastrous error of accidentally winning the play-offs at least a year too early in their process, it was easy to imagine they might have a Southampton-esque tilt at the Premier League’s ultimate wooden spoon.",
      "Technically they still might, of course, but we’re not afraid to admit that on the balance of probabilities a Sunderland team that has managed eight points from its first five games will probably manage to scrape together at least another four from the remaining 33.",

      "We’re five games into the Premier League season and some of the fears over big summer signings are being realised.",
      "All of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal appear to have made striker blunders, while Chelsea have signed a downgrade and Newcastle can’t get better than Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is a ‘flat-track bully’ \nThe major concern having watched Gyokeres plunder a gazillion goals for Sporting was whether he could match or even get near those goalscoring heights against superior opposition in the Premier League. The stats are damning.",
      "He’s scored three in five games so far, two against newly promoted Leeds and the third against a Nottingham Forest side whose manager had been in place for about four minutes. Not only has he failed to score against Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City, he’s accrued an xG of 0.0 in those three games.",
      "Mikel Arteta says Gyokeres is “trying his best”, bless him, and we assume the Arsenal boss will continue to insist a lack of service is to blame until Kai Havertz returns to fitness and replaces the Swede for these big games.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens is a Noni Madueke downgrade\nIt doesn’t say much for Gittens’ standing five games into his career at Chelsea that at no point amid Enzo Maresca’s irrational substitutions against Manchester United on Saturday was there any great dismay at him failing to turn to the £48.5m winger to get them back into the game. At least Alejandro Garnacho was on the verge of being introduced before being snubbed in favour of Tyrique George and Malo Gusto.",
      "He looks like a man who doesn’t truly believe he should be there, in many ways the antithesis of Madueke, who may not have set the world alight at Stamford Bridge, but never lacked for confidence. And after his fine start at Arsenal, it feels as though Chelsea have simply nurtured, developed and improved one winger to aid their Premier League rivals and replaced him with another at the start of that journey, very possibly without the same self-belief to take those positive steps forward.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz is too lightweight\nWhile we totally understand why he’s been targeted and have absolutely jumped on the bandwagon, Wirtz has not been half as bad as the Liverpool-baiting media and fan responses to his performances would suggest.",
      "As much as anything, we all just need a stick to beat the Premier League champions-elect with right now, and much of the criticism is based around the fear of just how f***ed everyone else is when he and Liverpool actually start playing well. We’re getting the jabs in while we still can.",
      "A common slam is how easily he appears to get knocked off the ball. And he does look lightweight, but we are now all looking for examples which we’re guessing could be found by analysing the footage of plenty of Premier League No.10s. We don’t particularly remember Phil Foden or James Maddison bullying their way through opposition challenges, for example.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the new Rasmus Hojlund\nThere has perhaps been no greater sign of just how far the Manchester United stock has fallen than their fans batting away criticism of their new £67m striker after he was hooked at half-time in the victory over Chelsea by extolling the virtues of an Andy Carroll-esque flick-on from a long punt up the pitch.",
      "That was one of eight touches for Sesko in a half of football against 10 men in which he completed three passes, had no shots and didn’t attempt a dribble. He’s had five shots in 207 minutes of Premier League football. We know what you’re thinking – if only he was getting the service. Sound familiar?",
      "",
      "Liverpool don’t need Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak\nAs great headaches for a manager go, the struggle to choose between a striker who’s already got four goals and an assist and the most expensive Premier League signing of all time is a real doozy.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Slot “has to play” Ekitike after his fine start to life at Anfield, but although we would all revel in Isak continuing to watch Liverpool games rather than playing in them after escaping that whole-season reality on deadline day, Slot also sort of has to play him, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze is not a left winger\nWe don’t suppose Arsenal fans care all that much which left winger changed the game and secured victory in their Champions League opener before scoring an equaliser against their title rivals in the very next game, but you would have got pretty long odds on that player being Gabriel Martinelli at the start of the summer transfer window. Nico Williams or Rodrygo may have been more likely.",
      "Martinelli wouldn’t still be at Arsenal if they had received a good enough offer for the Brazilian, but still looks like their best bet on the left wing over Eze, very simply because Martinelli is a left winger and Eze is not.",
      "Arteta should accept Havertz-esque defeat now.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga isn’t worth £55m\nOur suggestion that Elanga may not be worth £55m to anyone else but is to Newcastle was predicated on him being able to replicate something similar to what he did for Nottingham Forest last season for his new club.",
      "Having started the first two games of the season he’s taken up a spot on the bench for the last three, which makes us wonder just how good a right winger Newcastle need to sign in order to one day displace Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens is not a No.1\nAsked whether Altay Bayindir is now his No.1 goalkeeper having started every Premier League game so far this season, Amorim insisted “nobody has a place that is his place”. He may very well have said the same thing had Manchester United signed Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, but either one of them would now definitely be in the starting XI.",
      "Bayindir may grow into the role and prove himself capable, but no right-minded United fan will have any real hope of that being the case, and they may currently be wondering why their club has spent 18 million precious pounds on a back-up goalkeeper who we can only assume is at best a minor improvement on the man currently tending goal.",
      "As soon as Ousmane Dembele was awarded the 2025 Ballon d’Or, the speculation must begin about the 2026 iteration.",
      "The Newcastle medical department is working overtime to expedite the recovery of the solution to their problems. Arsenal and Liverpool await some debuts too.",
      "West Ham have reached the stage where anger is in danger of giving way to apathy. It’s a club where absolutely everything seems broken beyond repair.",

      "Scott McTominay is officially the 18th best player in world football. He’s better than Jude Bellingham. He’s better than Erling Haaland. He’s better than Virgil van Dijk. He’s sure as sh*t better than any Manchester United player.",
      "Perhaps Rio Ferdinand should reflect on how after one season away from Old Trafford, he’s better than Declan Rice and only slightly worse than Harry Kane, who may not have been the pairing to cure all of United’s ills after all.",
      "In fairness to Ferdinand, he was against United selling McTominay to Napoli, although his steady Eddie reasoning hasn’t aged well after the Scot was named Serie A MVP in his debut season under Antonio Conte.",
      "“I look at Scott McTominay and not every player can be a star, a standout player,” Ferdinand said. “But to win the league you need the likes of John O’Shea, Wes Brown, Darren Fletcher.",
      "“They might not start every game but they were huge, you need those players and most of them know the DNA of the club, especially ones who have come through the academy, there’s a lot to be said for that. It really doesn’t sit well with me.",
      "“With McTominay you know what you’re getting. He might not always be a nine out of 10 but invariably he’s a solid seven out of 10 and sometimes he will be an eight out of 10 and get you a goal.”",
      "But the pundit recently fell into a trap which has claimed many a Manchester United stakeholder in the last decade or so, in claiming that issues can be solved by spending a couple of hundred million on two very good footballers.",
      "“I honestly think and I’m convinced that if Man United would have got Harry Kane and Declan Rice in that window, they’re in a different place now. It goes back to the environment, those two drive an environment I think because they’re two top pros.”",
      "There’s no doubt that Kane and Rice improve Manchester United, but Tottenham finished eighth in Kane’s last season for them despite his 30 goals in that campaign. Rice led West Ham to the Conference League title but a 14th-place Premier League finish. There’s only so much one man can do for a football club failing to meet expectations, or in this specific Ferdinand-imagined case, what two men can do at Manchester United.",
      "And based on the admittedly arbitrary Ballon d’Or ranking of all footballers in every position which sees McTominay placed between Rice in 27th and Kane in 13th, neither of those potential saviours would have had anything like the impact for the Red Devils that they’re currently having at Arsenal and Bayern Munich respectively.",

It goes one of two ways, either sparking a necessary period of collective and individual self-analysis or feeding into what seems to be a sort of victim mentality which has been allowed to fester at Villa Park.",
      "There is an increasing divide between those backing Emery and others who believe him to be the problem and removing him at least part of the solution.",
      "It has been an unfathomable spiral from that potentially transformative week in April when Southampton, Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle were all dispatched to the tune of ten goals. An inability to pinpoint any one broken thing is not helping, and the worst may well be yet to come.",

      "Jeff Shi extolled the virtues of “stability” and giving Pereira “time to work with the squad, to build a chemistry with new players”, but Marie Curie and Dmitri Mendeleev would struggle on that front as co-managers.",
      "A mere glance at that Wolves starting line-up is enough to conclude they do not have nearly enough of the requisite quality or experience. Sa; Agbadou, Mosquera, T. Gomes; Tchatchoua, J. Gomes, Krejci, R. Gomes; Lopez, Bellegarde; Arokodare is just a collection of random letters with no semblance of cohesion or identity.",

      "Baleba has now been substituted at half-time in two of those starts, while being taken off in the quadruple substitution which triggered that exceptional win over Manchester City.",
      "Against Spurs it was he who surrendered possession in the build-up to the first goal and while Fabian Hurzeler ought to engage in a little more introspection when it comes to carelessly dropping points when leading at home, the manager was right in his assessment of Baleba: he’s “not a machine” and it’s Brighton’s “responsibility” to help him.",
      "",
      "An inability to see out games has been a consistent issue for Brentford these past couple of seasons. No team dropped more points from winning positions than their 30 in 2023/24, and last season only four had a worse record when ahead.",
      "This season has seen Brentford already drop as many points from winning positions (eight) as in the entirety of their first campaign in the Premier League. What was once a key strength has become a glaring weakness.",
      "And the problem with appointing a continuity candidate with no prior senior management experience is that they will struggle to change those aspects of a club’s identity. Indeed, the nature of his promotion only encouraged Brentford to maintain rather than evolve.",
      "In the face of adversity these players will lean into the long throws, the set-pieces and back fives because it’s what they know. But there remains doubt as to whether Andrews has the tactical acumen to override that muscle memory and imprint his own style.",

      "That is 58 visits to Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United in the Premier League without a single win, obviously only propagated by Everton having just three extra minutes in which they could at no point look like scoring.",

      "And nine times out of ten that performance would have been good enough for a win. But it does not take a vivid imagination to see how games against Real Betis, Sunderland, Midtjylland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto and Bournemouth cause things to suddenly spiral before November.",
      "As soon as Ousmane Dembele was awarded the 2025 Ballon d’Or, the speculation must begin about the 2026 iteration.",

      "West Ham have reached the stage where anger is in danger of giving way to apathy. It’s a club where absolutely everything seems broken beyond repair.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "“When you are playing against better teams, there are times when you’re not going to have the ball, and that’s when you have to know the position brilliantly.

      "“He had Doku coming inside. I’ve been there myself, you’re constantly looking over your shoulder, thinking where is my man, it’s a horrible place to be at times. If you’re on the ball all the time, then Fernandes is brilliant [in deeper midfield].",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who only really has misery and Graham Potter for company.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Even after five wins from five games there is a small yet irritatingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but that voice won’t quit.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Finally managed to win a game without needing a dramatic late goal against Everton, but didn’t quite put to bed those ‘weirdly flaky when 2-0 up’ allegations, either.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal are broadly unscathed, yet it also does feel like they’re already playing catch-up from that all-too-familiar second place. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford – and 0-0 draw with a good Palace side – means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brought back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "It’s not been awful, but it’s really not been great either. Being above Manchester United is not the boast it used to be.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there could be more on the wagon.",
      "",
      "Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly. Heavy defeats at Arsenal can and do happen to anyone – draws with Burnley less so – but it is an inauspicious start nonetheless for a manager whose methods have suffered a further blow by the speed and extent with which Spurs have improved basic things like ‘defending set-pieces’ and ‘attacking set-pieces’ and ‘having a midfield’ under Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening five games to go with a creditable draw against Newcastle is plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed for now.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "Bleak fare indeed, and you do wonder whether Emery might now be minded to take any opportunity to jump ship that comes his way before his reputation starts to sink with Villa’s league position.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "There is some good news, though, because Wolves have a much-needed appointment scheduled with Dr Tottenham this weekend.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. The 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea is not a turning point; they’ve run out of those.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what four defeats in the opening five games will do to you after a summer where little went right for West Ham.",
      "Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that. Then any hint of renewed optimism was dashed by grim  flaw-exposing defeats to Tottenham and Crystal Palace.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "Teddy Sheringham reckons United should do away with Ruben Amorim and bring in Gareth Southgate who could fix the place up a bit.",
      "Man Utd have finalised a three-man shortlist to replace Ruben Amorim if the Red Devils decide to sack the Portuguese coach, according to reports.",
      "Amorim *could* do some coaching like Slot has done to transform a Liverpool star into ‘the best in the world’. The Man Utd boss has an opportunity vs Brentford.",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",

      "After a game in which Manchester United fans roundly booed a player they very recently considered one of their greatest hopes for the future, a number of them took a step towards ostracising a new great hope by abusing them on social media for their association with that most abominable defector.",
      "“Who’s that t*** from Argentina? Who’s that money-grabbing w**re” was the chant aimed at Alejandro Garnacho by the Red Devils faithful, all of whom will have no doubt sung ‘Viva Garnacho’ in earnest throughout a Manchester United career which, lest we forget, was cut short by Ruben Amorim, not Garnacho himself.",
      "Sure, Garnacho described the season as “sh*t” when asked for his assessment after being dropped for the Europa League final. But not one single United fan will have disagreed with that. And it was Amorim who told Garnacho in front of his teammates ahead of the final league game of the season that “you better pray you can find a new club to sign you”. He may well be a “money-grabbing w**re”, but he was given no option but to leave United.",
      "We understand some hostility on the basis of Garnacho wearing Marcus Rashford’s Aston Villa shirt, which was an absurdly childish means to wind up the club which was still paying his wages, but the decision had already been made by that point. He was never going to play for United again.",
      "Garnacho’s unforgivable crime was not being in the plans of a manager whose Old Trafford tenure is still widely deemed to be doomed despite the win over Chelsea, largely because of his failure to waver from a philosophy and formation unsuited to the vast majority of the players still in his squad, let alone those like Garnacho who have already escaped it.",
      "The 21-year-old was denied the opportunity to further rile with a goal and we suspect what would have been a badge-kissing celebration, but the Garnacho-obsessed United fans didn’t skip a post-match opportunity to make their confused feelings felt, when they piled on Amad Diallo for swapping shirts with the Argentinian.",
      "Amad was seen hugging Garnacho at full-time, like you or I might do when meeting a pal, before later posting a picture on Instagram of him and his former teammate smiling and posing with one another’s shirts, quite possibly under the instruction of Lead3rS, the agency which represents both of them.",
      "The more P.C. responses from United fans to the post, reported by The Sun, included ‘Amad is an idiot’, ‘Amad doing this sh*t after dropping a stinker’ and ‘can you read the room Amad?’ We don’t know how extensive and unpleasant the reaction was, though we can guess as the result was Amad deleting that post, all other Instagram posts and all but one on X.",
      "Our question to United fans is a simple one: Why do you care? The only effect of abusing Amad for being friends with Garnacho is to alienate another young player.",
      "It would have been unthinkable a year ago for Garnacho and fellow ‘untouchable’ Rasmus Hojlund to be playing elsewhere this season, while a third in Kobbie Mainoo looks for an exit. Amad was last season’s brightest spark, and is now being presented with reasons to think a future away from United is an attractive prospect by fans who can’t help but stick the boot in where it’s not needed.",
      "The switch from unadulterated love for Garnacho to pure hatred is weird enough, but for that remarkable feelings U-turn to extend to anyone who comes into contact with him is absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Enzo Maresca has explained why he decided to leave Chelsea without an attack through his substitutions in their defeat to Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United stars ‘privately’ gave a ‘withering verdict’ on Alejandro Garnacho before he joined Chelsea in the summer.",
      "A new report has revealed how Alejandro Garnacho and Ruben Amorim’s ‘relationship unravelled’, with an ‘intervention’ involving three Man Utd stars failing.",
      "Maresca dismissed suggestions he selected a weak Chelsea team with Bayern Munich in mind, while Garnacho is blamed for ‘falling asleep’.",
      "Chelsea needed a half-fit Cole Palmer to spark them into life at Brentford. But Alejandro Garnacho went to sleep on the Bees’ biggest weapon…",
      "It has been claimed that Chelsea could ‘almost immediately agree’ a mega-money transfer after signing Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United."

      "Manchester United’s victory over Chelsea on Saturday has relieved the mounting pressure on Ruben Amorim’s shoulders a touch, and he will no doubt take the win as a notch on his bedpost of obstinacy, but after Arne Slot turned a Liverpool star into one of the best, if not the best, in a previously alien position, Kobbie Mainoo must be wondering why a supposedly excellent coach can’t do the same for him.",
      "Mainoo was introduced in the 87th minute to see out United’s victory over Chelsea, and showed his worth to the team even in that short cameo, winning a corner in stoppage time to put the nail in the Blues’ coffin, having illustrated it far more evidently in the defeat to Manchester City as the Red Devils’ best player on the day after coming off the bench.",
      "The 20-year-old is yet to start a Premier League game this season, featuring for just 76 minutes in total, having been denied a loan exit at the end of the transfer window in search of more game time and amid rumours of January moves from various high-grade suitors.",
      "Amorim’s contention is that he can’t play Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in his double pivot. The United captain’s display against Chelsea served as a timely reminder as to why he remains so crucial to the Red Devils after an inauspicious start to the season.",
      "But Casemiro’s experience was no match for his stupidity and he is now suspended for their next game after his red card, and although Manuel Ugarte put in one of his better performances as his replacement in midfield at half-time, the Uruguayan’s very low bar suggests Amorim should at least be tempted to play Mainoo alongside his captain against Brentford next time out.",
      "Because while Amorim may currently feel as though he’s ill-suited to the role, and we don’t necessarily disagree, it is also possible for a coach to coach a footballer – particularly one so young and seemingly open to developing and adapting his game – into playing a new position.",
      "Just as Slot has done with Ryan Gravenberch, who was once again outstanding for Liverpool in their 2-1 win over Everton on Saturday, leading Michael Owen to question whether there is a better No.6 in the world right now.",
      "“He is seriously talented,” Owen said. “He can do anything. I love him in the sitting number six role. It just shows you can push him forward, and he can still have a big influence.",
      "“I look around the world at the moment at midfield players and I think, Who is better than him? Who is performing better than him? I don’t see many at all. I think, he is one of the finds of the last season or so.”",
      "He was heavily linked with the Liverpool exit in the summer of 2024, and if the Reds had landed Martin Zubimendi after having an offer accepted for the now Arsenal No.6, there’s a very good chance Gravenberch wouldn’t still be at the club.",
      "But in a situation very similar to the one being experienced by Amorim at United after they failed to sign Brighton’s Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfielder this summer, Slot was pushed into playing Gravenberch as a square peg in that round hole, and the Netherlands international is now perfectly spherical having adapted in stunning fashion.",
      "“Not just this season, he’s been playing like that from the moment last season started,” Virgil Van Dijk said after the win over Everton. “He’s unbelievable. He’s very important to the way we play.",
      "“You see the amount of times I try to look for him. It benefits him, me and the team. He’s in incredible shape. He’s in the form of his life. He has to keep going. He’s still young.",
      "“During his first season here he hardly played either. Listen, it’s a mix of everything: getting confidence, progressing and improving as a player, playing games at the highest level and knowing your role in the team.",
      "“I’m very pleased for him because he puts in a lot of hard work to do what he is doing.”",
      "We understand that a Mainoo-Fernandes partnership isn’t ideal, but nothing is at United right now, and if Slot can turn a negative into such a huge positive, why can’t Amorim?",
      "He’s concerned his players will lose respect for him if he wavers from his philosophy and formation, but surely the absolute opposite would be true if they witness him coaching one of the most talented footballers in the squad to operate in a role which – let’s face it – is hardly light and day to the one Mainoo thrived in for United and England last season.",
      "Teddy Sheringham reckons United should do away with Ruben Amorim and bring in Gareth Southgate who could fix the place up a bit.",
      "Man Utd have finalised a three-man shortlist to replace Ruben Amorim if the Red Devils decide to sack the Portuguese coach, according to reports.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",
      "Ruben Amorim ‘might not even be in his job’ if Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘hadn’t appointed him’ as Man Utd boss and the Chelsea win is ‘no turning point’.",
      "Enzo Maresca lost his head and openly admitted it after taking the Manchester United sack pressure from Ruben Amorim and placing it on his own shoulders.",
      "Paul Merson has made a prediction relating to Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, while Wayne Rooney has raised one “big question” about the game vs Chelsea."

      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",
      "However, he is concerned about what his squad would think if he changed now and hopes he will be in charge long enough for it to happen.",

      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",

      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
