      "James Weir was handed his Manchester United debut off the bench against Arsenal in February 2016 and went on to enjoy a career in Europe before an early retirement",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder James Weir has opted to call time on his career at the age of 28.",
      "His only appearance for the Red Devils came in January 2016 when Louis van Gaal was at the helm. An injury-hit United side saw off Arsenal 3-2 at Old Trafford with Marcus Rashford, who was also making his debut, scoring a memorable brace for the hosts.",
      "Weir was introduced as a substitute in stoppage time, replacing Ander Herrera. That short stint on the pitch proved to be his only outing for United as he and Rashford saw their careers go in very different directions.",
      "The Englishman joined Hull City on a permanent deal just months after his Manchester debut. He spent three years at the Yorkshire club, albeit he only played a handful of games. Weir had a loan spell at Wigan before later joining Bolton.",
      "After that he headed to mainland Europe, moving to Slovakian side Pohronie, where he spent two years. He then had a stint at MTK Budapest in Hungary before returning to Slovakia once again. That proved to be his final switch with Weir hanging up his boots well before his 30th birthday.",
      "He posted on Instagram: \"Life update. After a lot of thought and consideration, I’ve decided to hang up my boots professionally. A bittersweet moment, but I can look back on my career with happy memories. Despite my injuries, I’ve met some incredible people, forged life-long relationships and travelled the world doing what I love.",
      "\"Huge thank you to family, friends, coaches, teammates and fans who’ve all helped me on my journey. Through the highs, lows and everything in between, I’ve lived my dream. I’m excited in the pursuit of living my next dream away from the beautiful game.\"",
      "Van Gaal gifted a host of youngsters their opportunities whilst he was in charge in Manchester. The Dutchman was more than happy to trust in youth with Rashford his biggest success story. He also handed out debuts to the likes of Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Tyler Blackett.",
      "Jesse Lingard's first United appearance came as a result of Van Gaal with the midfielder going on to become a major player during his tenure, scoring the winner in the FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace back in 2016."

      "Marcus Rashford has been told to stop partying and boozing if he wants to fulfil his full potential at Manchester United.",
      "Rashford was fined two weeks' wages – around £700,000 - for failing to report for training after going on a two-day boozy bender in Belfast. The England striker “took responsibility for his actions” and was restored to the side after being dropped for United's 4-2 FA Cup win at Newport.",
      "Former United captain Gary Neville has told Rashford he cannot afford to be going out on the town and warned him about the people he surrounds himself with.",
      "“We were talking about Marcus Rashford, about having that right group of people around him,” said Neville. “You can’t do the things that your friends are doing, so if you’re influenced by your friends, there's that element of 'Oh go on then' and that 'Go on then' would have done me.”",
      "Neville, speaking on the Stick to Football Podcast, said he sacrificed his social life at the start of his United career, something Rashford has not done.",
      "“I never went out in the first five or six years of my career at Manchester United,” Neville declared. “I don’t think I could have done.",
      "“To me, it was work ethic and love for the club, I listened, trained, and wanted to do well. These are the things that are the biggest factor.”",
      "Rashford was restored to the United line-up for their dramatic 4-3 win at Wolves last week and went some way to atoning for his ill-discipline by opening the scoring with a stunning strike.",
      "But the 26-year-old, who plundered a career-best 30 goals last season, only has five from 28 games in all competitions this term and has struggled to find his best form."

      "Van Persie was spotted having a four-hour dinner with Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag and his agent Kees Voss shortly following United's 3-0 win over West Ham last weekend. It has now been revealed that the 40-year-old is back in Manchester as part of his UEFA Pro Licence.",
      "The coaching course requires him to spend time learning at a foreign club and Van Persie asked Ten Hag if he could visit United. Ten Hag agreed and Van Persie, as well as fellow Dutch coaches Ruben de Uil and Tim Bakens, will observe first-team training and carry out workshops with United staff.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson signed Van Persie from Arsenal in 2012 and he spent three seasons at Old Trafford, helping them win the Premier League in 2013. Following his retirement in 2019, he returned to his former club Feyenoord to begin his coaching career.",
      "Van Persie has worked with both the first team and the academy and was approached by Ten Hag to join his coaching staff when he took over as United boss in 2022. However, Van Persie rejected the offer because he wanted to continue developing at Feyenoord and did not want to uproot his family.",
      "\"My son and daughter are important right now,\" he told Life After Football. \"The fact that they have both found their passion is great. A hobby is nice, but you hope that they really find a passion.",
      "\"Dina succeeded in doing that with horse riding, she's totally into it, and Shaqueel has the same thing with soccer. My wife, Bouchra, is developing all her talents with our projects and that's great to see. We're enjoying ourselves together.",
      "\"In London, when I played at Arsenal, we moved five times. We also lived in Manchester and Istanbul. All in all, we were away for almost fourteen years. But then we thought 'What's good for the kids now?' and felt a little stability would be nice.\"",
      "Van Persie's son Shaqueel is also on the books at Feyenoord, having signed his first professional contract with the club in 2022 after joining their academy setup from Manchester City back in 2017.",
      "\"As a club, we are very satisfied with the development that Shaqueel is undergoing at Feyenoord,\" academy boss Rini Coolen said at the time. \"He is strong, has an excellent winning mentality, easily scores goals and shows that he is a real leader during training and matches.\""

      "Dozens of players have traded England for Turkey in recent years, with many still playing in the Super Lig. Several moved just last summer, including Wilfried Zaha and Davinson Sanchez joining Galatasaray and Nicolas Pepe trading Arsenal for Trabzonspor.",
      "It hasn't stopped in January, either. Fulham striker Carlos Vinicius has joined Zaha and Sanchez in Istanbul, and Hwang Ui-jo joining Alanyaspor on loan from Nottingham Forest.",
      "Could there be one or two more deals wrapped up before Friday's deadline, though? Here, Mirror Football picks out five Premier League men who could be the subject of interest from Turkish clubs.",
      "According to reports in Turkey, Eriksen has held 'secret' talks with Galatasaray over a potential move. The Danish international has found game time harder to come by at Manchester United, with Kobbie Mainoo developing into a regular starter in central midfield.",
      "Eriksen, who joined United in the summer of 2022, is under contract until the end of the 2024-25 season. He has played 19 times this term, but started just three times since returning from injury just before Christmas.",
      "",
      "Despite reports of conversations over a move, Eriksen is expected to stay at Old Trafford at least until the end of the season. If he remains sidelined by Erik ten Hag, though, the situation could change in the longer-term.",
      "Arsenal defender Cedric was another on Galatasaray's radar after the January sale of right-back Sacha Boey. If he wants a move, though, it might need to be elsewhere - with Gala instead moving for Nottingham Forest man Serge Aurier.",
      "Portugal international Cedric, 32, has played less than 90 senior minutes all season long. His only start came in the Champions League dead rubber against PSV Eindhoven, while he also got a run-out for Arsenal's Under-21 side in the EFL Trophy.",
      "Even if Cedric doesn't find a new club this month, he'll need to move to pastures new in the summer. His Gunners contract expires at the end of the current campaign, with no signs he'll be offered a new deal.",
      "Argentina international Lo Celso returned to Tottenham over the summer after 18 months away on loan, showing signs of a renaissance with goals in successive games against Aston Villa and Manchester City. He got a run in the side when James Maddison was out injured, but Maddison's return has coincided with an injury for Lo Celso himself.",
      "His injury is not thought to be long-term, with (you guessed it) Galatasaray linked with a move in the Turkish press. Former Spurs men Vinicius and Sanchez are already at the club, while Tanguy Ndombele joined on loan from the London club last summer, though Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou's recent comment about Lo Celso don't sound like the words of a man desperate to sell.",
      "\"\"Gio was great, he's been great the last two or three weeks,\" Postecoglou said after the December victory over Bournemouth. \"With the amount of injuries we've had and absences we've had, we've needed everyone in the group and everybody who has come in has stepped up.\"",
      "Forgotten man Sarr was moments from leaving Chelsea for Le Havre at the end of the Premier League window, only for the move to collapse. “It is shameful what they did to him,” the French side's sporting director Mathieu Bodmer said (as translated by Get French Football News), with the Blues accused of failing to submit the relevant documents in time.",
      "Despite staying in West London, defender Sarr is no closer to featuring under Mauricio Pochettino. Indeed, he hasn't even made a matchday squad this term, though, and is set to enter the final year of his contract come the summer.",
      "The initial Le Havre proposal is said to have involved the 25-year-old cancelling his Chelsea contract and signing a two-and-a-half year deal in France. With no path to the first team at Stamford Bridge, might a Turkish move appeal?",
      "Everton forward Danjuma is understood to have wanted assurances about first-team football in January. The Dutchman joined the Toffees on loan from Villarreal for the season, but was linked with a Lyon switch in the winter window.",
      "In the end, the former Bournemouth man stayed on Merseyside and Lyon looked elsewhere. The Ligue 1 strugglers spent big in January, with Gift Orban bolstering their attacking ranks and Said Benrahma completing a last-minute loan from West Ham.",
      "January brought Danjuma's first two league starts since September, but he picked up an ankle injury against Fulham which kept him out of Saturday's draw with Spurs. He may feel the recent minutes represent enough of a show of confidence from Sean Dyche, but if not then there could be a fresh exit route."

      "\"I understood well why he went to United back then, and I've said that publicly. I also think he's done well. Of course, he had an injury before Christmas for a while. But if Christian wants, he's very welcome.\"",

      "Roy Keane enjoyed a brilliant career at Manchester United and was captain for their best-ever season, but the Republic of Ireland midfielder has one major regret",
      "Roy Keane has admitted he was heartbroken to miss Manchester United’s famous Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999.",
      "United won the Treble in the 1998/99 season, with Sir Alex Ferguson ’s side claiming the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies. It was an impressive achievement that has gone down in the club’s history and made the squad revered by fans.",
      "Keane was captain of the team and played in the 2-0 win over Newcastle in the FA Cup final on May 22, but like Paul Scholes, was unable to take the field four days later in Barcelona. The Republic of Ireland international was injured at Wembley, so might have been unavailable anyway, but he still felt the pain of missing the iconic match, which saw United score twice in added time to come from behind and beat Bayern 2-1.",
      "Asked on the Stick to Football podcast whether he had a sinking feeling about missing the game, Keane replied: “Yes, you do. The standard answer when people ask you is, ‘That’s life,’ but it’s heartbreaking when you miss a big game like that.",
      "“Your mindset at the time is that you’re United, competing, and you’re convinced that you’ll get back to another final, but you don’t. Scholesy did eventually get back to another one, I didn’t, and that’s the reality and brutal side of the game. You can’t be suspended now [for a final], just my luck that.”",
      "Keane travelled with the squad to Barcelona and was there to witness his team making history thanks to Teddy Sheringham’s equaliser and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ’s winner. But he allowed stand-in skipper Peter Schmeichel to lift the trophy, insisting he wouldn’t feel comfortable doing so himself after not playing.",
      "“No, I don’t agree with that,” he explained. “I’m not against other people doing it, but at the time I would have been really embarrassed, cringing to be honest. We went down at the end, me and Scholesy, but that was late into it and even then, I was thinking, ‘really,’ cringing.”",
      "Gary Neville played in the Champions League final for United and thinks the win was even more special because of absences of Keane and Scholes, who was also suspended. He said: “We only found out a couple of weeks before that Roy and Scholes couldn’t play but because all the games we had left were the FA Cup final and last game of the season, we couldn’t practise with the team, we had no games in hand to work with.”",
      "Neville felt the team “were all over the place” towards the end while chasing the game, with Ferguson throwing on reinforcements in search of a goal. Ryan Giggs and David Beckham were among those forced to play out of position due to Keane and Scholes not being available.",
      "“Giggsy was playing on the right that night, for 75 minutes – I never played with Giggsy [down the right side] in my life, and he’d never played with me,” he explained. “Yorke was upfront with Coley (Andy Cole), Jesper [Blomqvist] was on the left and Becks was in central midfield.”"

      "As part of our collaboration with WhoScored, Mirror Football looks at the emergence of the Manchester United midfielder, who must be on the radar for Gareth Southgate ahead of the Euros",
      "It may have been overlooked over the weekend but Jordan Henderson made his debut for Ajax on Saturday.",
      "The 33-year-old left Al-Ettifaq after just six months in Saudi Arabia in a move that tarnished his reputation. One person who didn't miss Ajax's Eredivisie meeting with PSV, though, was England boss Gareth Southgate.",
      "In attendance at the Johan Cruyff Arena, Southgate wouldn't have seen anything he didn't already know about Henderson, who was, as is to be expected, tidy in possession in the 1-1 draw. Southgate would have been better off saving his air miles and making the trip to Old Trafford instead.",
      "While Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund stole the plaudits for their respective performances in front of goal, the 3-0 win over West Ham marked yet another solid display from Kobbie Mainoo in the middle of the park. Fresh from netting a late winner at Wolves on Thursday night, Mainoo put in another fine showing, this time alongside Casemiro, up until his withdrawal midway through the second half.",
      "Injury in pre-season delayed Mainoo's emergence on the scene but he's quickly getting to speed with the demands of regular senior football and maximising his opportunity to nail down a regular spot in the United midfield, not just for the rest of the season; but for years to come. Southgate could do a lot worse that follow suit and bring the teenage into the Three Lions fold sooner rather than later.",
      "Ghana are believed to be looking to sway the midfielder's international allegiance. \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents,\" Randy Abbey, a member of the executive council of the Ghana FA, said recently. Best act fast then, Gareth!",
      "Having spent the bulk of Erik ten Hag's first summer in charge at Old Trafford actively pursuing Frenkie de Jong, they should have taken one glance at the academy to realise they had a midfielder on the books who would actively seek possession from the defence and drive the team forward. Ten Hag saw sense ahead of his second full season only for Mainoo to sustain an ankle injury against Real Madrid over the summer. Where might United be now had he been fit for the entirety of the campaign?",
      "The fact is, he's the perfect midfielder to help drive United on. An average of 0.9 dribbles per 90 is modest but then you have to remember this is a midfielder in his breakout campaign, one who might be more willing to play a safe option rather than get bullied off the ball in such a key area of the pitch.",
      "That he is being dispossessed just 0.9 times per 90 shows he can handle the physicality of England's top tier, this despite only turning 18 last April. England do have players prepared to receive the ball from the defence but the standout in this category is Declan Rice, and he's expected to anchor the midfield for the Three Lions this summer.",
      "In England's favoured three-man midfield, there is arguably a role for Mainoo in Southgate's preferred 4-3-3 setup. Henderson only has one top-flight European game under his belt this season while Kalvin Phillips has looked rusty in his two West Ham appearances following his arrival from Manchester City. By comparison, Mainoo looks scalpel sharp.",
      "On the ball, improvements are needed of course. England are a nation expected to dominate on the international stage but Mainoo has returned a pass success rate of just 85.3 per cent from 42.3 passes per 90 in the Premier League this season. This may be a reason why Southgate is reluctant to hand Mainoo international recognition just yet.",
      "The England boss wants control in games, a quality to the teenage midfielder's game that isn't presently quite up to the standard of his more senior compatriots. Of course this will improve in time and there's no doubt that Mainoo will become a fully fledged England international further down the line... provided Ghana don't swoop for the United star first.",
      "Nevertheless, he's proving the brain of this United midfield. While in an ideal world, Mainoo would have been eased into first-team action rather than thrown in at the deep and asked to sink or swim, of which he has done the latter.",
      "The next logical step is international recognition, which is likely to come sooner rather than later. If Southgate had any sense about him he'd be focussing his efforts on the future rather than spending his time watching midfielders who'll soon be part of the past."

      "The next generation of Manchester United stars may struggle to blossom at the club due to the lack of leaders in the dressing room, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Neville came through the famed United academy and made his debut in 1992 as part of a talented group of youngsters. The right-back was in the same crop as his brother Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs, who became known as the Class of 92.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was able to integrate the young players alongside established stars like Peter Schmeichel, Roy Keane, Steve Bruce, Denis Irwin and Paul Ince. Those players helped guide Neville and his peers, but he doesn’t think the current crop like Kobbie Mainoo have the same support system.",
      "“It’s a massive factor, the dressing room that you come into as a young player and the influence and standard bearers in the dressing room,” Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast. “These United lads who have come through in the last five to eight years, if you’re a young lad coming through at Liverpool and Manchester City you’ve got a good chance, whereas if you’re at United now, you’re thinking who's guiding that dressing room.”",
      "Mainoo has been one of the bright sparks for United this season, with the 18-year-old becoming a fixture in Erik ten Hag’s midfield. He is leading a group of young players who are pushing for starts, alongside the likes of Omari Forson, Willy Kambwala and Amad Diallo.",
      "Former United skipper Keane agrees with Neville’s assessment of the current crop under Ten Hag. He joined the club from Nottingham Forest in 1993 and was immediately struck by the atmosphere in the dressing room.",
      "“I loved the dressing room,” he said. “I thought all these players were brilliant professionals, and I looked around and thought what a great group of people. Players like Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, all amazing professional players.",
      "“Remember the Cliff, our old training ground in Salford, I’d come in for a big fee at the time, but I was looking around the group and even the chat and the banter was great. My first pre-season we went to South Africa, and I couldn’t believe how brilliant It was and how good the players were.",
      "“We’re talking about plenty of players when we played who would happily give tough love, but clearly no one is doing that at Manchester United for Marcus Rashford and that is one of the problems that the team has, they don’t have that core group of players.”"

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made several trips to Manchester United's training ground since the club confirmed the British billionaire is to take a 25 per cent stake",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's repeated presence at Manchester United's Carrington training ground has gone down well with those around the club, it has been claimed, with a sense he is \"getting down to business\".",
      "Ratcliffe's arrival at United was confirmed on Christmas Eve, with the billionaire's 25 per cent investment - worth around £1.3bn - expected to be ratified this month. He has already been to his first United match since the announcement, taking in the Premier League draw with Tottenham in January, and has made multiple visits to Carrington.",
      "United's long-term owners the Glazer family have only made fleeting appearances during their nearly two decades at the helm. Ratcliffe, in contrast, has taken what appears to be a more active role in proceedings.",
      "The INEOS chief has been joined by ally Sir Dave Brailsford for several visits, including an appearance at Old Trafford on Tuesday for a memorial service honouring the victims of the Munich Air Disaster. According to the Manchester Evening News, there has been recognition of the fact that Ratcliffe has wasted little time even as he waits for final regulatory approval for his investment.",
      "The same publication notes that no member of the Glazer family has attended a fan-led Munich memorial service. Ratcliffe, who grew up supporting United, spoke about his fandom both during his bid to invest in United and after the late December announcement about his investment.",
      "\"As a local boy and a lifelong supporter of the Club, I am very pleased that we have been able to agree a deal with the Manchester United Board that delegates us management responsibility of the football operations of the Club,\" he said. \"Whilst the commercial success of the Club has ensured there have always been available funds to win trophies at the highest level, this potential has not been fully unlocked in recent times.",
      "\"We will bring the global knowledge, expertise and talent from the wider INEOS Sport group to help drive further improvement at the Club, while also providing funds intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford. We are here for the long term and recognise that a lot of challenges and hard work lie ahead, which we will approach with rigour, professionalism and passion.",
      "\"We are committed to working with everyone at the Club – the Board, staff, players and fans – to help drive the Club forward. Our shared ambition is clear: we all want to see Manchester United back where we belong, at the very top of English, European and world football.\"",
      "The Ratcliffe era has already begun to take shape, though not in the transfer market. United made no new additions to their first-team squad in January, instead offloading more than a dozen senior and under-21 players.",
      "One of the significant new appointments is that of Omar Berrada, who will join from City Football Group as United's new CEO. Predecessor Richard Arnold left his post at the end of last year, with Patrick Stewart serving as interim CEO until Berrada takes the reins.",
      "Ratcliffe's investment moved one step closer this week, with an SEC filing showing a special resolution had been passed at an extraordinary general meeting of the club's board. This resolution will grant enhanced voting powers to the Class B shares purchased by Ratcliffe’s INEOS corporation.",
      "Despite not being majority owners, INEOS will be in charge of United's football operations. In addition to Ratcliffe's trips to Carrington, United staff members are said to have made the journey to Ratcliffe's home of Monaco for separate meetings."

      "Harry Maguire's bid to finally clear his name over a brawl in Mykonos is set for another delay due to a lawyers’ strike in Greece.",
      "Maguire was arrested and later found guilty of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and attempted bribery while on holiday in August 2020. The 30-year-old Manchester United defender was handed a 21-month suspended sentence for his involvement in the fight outside a bar.",
      "He appealed the verdict, which nullified the conviction under Greek law, but has been awaiting a hearing on the neighbouring island of Syros ever since. The England international was hoping to clear his name and finally draw a line under the incident on Wednesday, but his hearing before an appeals court judge has been pushed back.",
      "“The case is going to be adjourned,” the prosecution lawyer Yannis Paradisis told the Guardian. “The strike has meant court proceedings cannot take place. We will be given a new date by the judge tomorrow.”",
      "Paradisis, who represents two of the three policemen who claim Maguire kicked and punched them, added: “They are professionals and they know that justice [in this country] can take a long time.” It has now been 42 months since the brawl which landed Maguire in trouble. When the hearing does take place, Maguire won’t have to attend in person – instead he would give evidence via videolink.",
      "“At this rate Maguire may have retired from professional football when he receives a summons,” a court official at the Syros tribunal told the Guardian. “After eight years the statute of limitations kicks in. If the case hasn’t been heard by then it will be written off.”",
      "Mirror Football have contacted Maguire’s representatives to request comment. It is not the first time his case has been shelved, with the same thing happening in May after his lawyer, Alexis Anagnostakis, was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict.",
      "The incident happened when Maguire was on holiday with a group of family and friends which included his wife Fern Hawkins, his sister, Daisy, and his brother Joe. He claims that the altercation started outside the Bonbonniere bar after Daisy was injected with an unknown substance by two strangers.",
      "He alleges that, despite wanting to take her to a hospital, he was taken to a police station where he was beaten. Worried he was part of a kidnap attempt, Maguire attempted to flee the scene. “Some people will believe me, some people won’t,” he told The Times in November 2022. “But one thing I would say about Mykonos is that I have no regrets.",
      "“I don’t worry about what the outcome is going to be. I don’t worry about anything to do with it because my conscience is so clear about what happened that night. The people who were there that night, there were nine of us, we all understand what went on and what happened.”"

      "Though the former Chelsea boss guided the Giallorossi to two European cup finals, Mourinho was relieved from his duties as Roma boss last month after a particularly dismal run of form. It has since emerged that the self-proclaimed 'special one' didn't take this news all too well.",
      "The 61-year-old returned a ring that was gifted to him by his players following their Europa Conference League success in 2022. Mourinho is said to have left it in the locker of captain Lorenzo Pellegrini, as per Italian outlet Il Messaggero.",
      "His gesture didn't end there however, as alongside the ring Mourinho left a note to his former squad. It read: \"When you are men, give it back to me.\"",
      "The note is a clear representation of how Mourinho felt like his players didn't give their all for him to turn their season around. At the time of his departure, Roma languished as low as ninth in the Serie A table.",
      "However, since his interim successor Daniele de Rossi took charge, the players have managed to find some form out of somewhere and have since won three games out of three in the post-Mourinho era. Their most recent outing saw them demolish Cagliari with a 4-0 now win which in turn, sent them to fifth in the table.",
      "Mourinho was adored by the Roma faithful and news of his sacking was not greeted well by the club's supporters. However, three successive wins has turned the morale around, but the man himself is still hurting.",
      "Since his Stadio Olimpico exit, Mourinho has been linked with a number of jobs - including a sensational return to the Premier League to take charge of either of his former sides in Chelsea or Manchester United.",
      "According to sources close to the Portuguese coach, his heart is set on another shot in the Old Trafford dug-out. However, Erik ten Hag is starting to relieve some of the pressure that was mounting on him after three consecutive wins.",

Mauricio Pochettino can't seem to get a tune out of his expensively assembled Chelsea squad and fans are growing louder in their discontent, though Mourinho is not a name expected to be on Todd Boehly's wishlist of successors if the current manager can't turn things around."

      "Rasmus Hojlund has bizarrely been told he is on \"borrowed time\" by Manchester United legend Dwight Yorke - despite being in the best form of his Red Devils career.",
      "The Denmark international has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games, after a lengthy spell that lasted four months without one. Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in the summer for an eye-watering fee of £72million, but failed to hit the ground running and as a result, the expensive transfer was questioned by fans and pundits alike.",
      "However, Boxing Day's 3-2 win over Aston Villa saw Hojlund net his first league goal and he hasn't looked back since. As a result, the bulk of United fans are significantly more optimistic about how their striker will fare in the long run, but Yorke clearly doesn't share that sentiment.",
      "The ex-United ace explained that Hojlund may suffer from not having enough senior players operating at the peak of their powers to learn from. Yorke questioned if the former Atalanta ace is the answer to United's problems, before telling Sky Sports: \"He’s still on that borrowed time, he still needs time, but I’m glad that he’s got a couple of goals. That may settle him down.",
      "\"Another question, what are his strengths? Because I still don’t know what his strengths are. Often enough, when you do your due diligence about players and your playing £75m for a player – is he fast, can he head it, can he shoot, can he dribble…?\"",
      "Yorke continued, questioning what traits United identified when they scouted Hojlund from the Serie A outfit. He also added that the club's wider struggles are hardly going to help create an environment where the striker can thrive.",
      "\"If you’re coming in it doesn’t matter how good you are, how young you are or how old you are, you’re going to be struggling in a team that is struggling, that is inconsistent,\" Yorke explained. \"I feel for the kid and I think there will be some challenging times ahead for him.\"",
      "The suggestion that Hojlund is on borrowed time is not the first time Yorke has levelled that claim at a United player. He said the same about Jadon Sancho back in May of last year.",
      "It played out as Yorke predicted in that instance, with Sancho now on loan at Borussia Dortmund less than three years after he first arrived at United as part of a £73m move, after a fall-out with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "With that being said, Hojlund is a Ten Hag signing and has had no complaints about his work ethic or attitude. It seems incredibly unlikely he meets the same fate as the exiled Sancho any time soon."

      "Tottenham landed up and coming Swedish star Lucas Bergvall in the January transfer window but the teenage sensation had previously been on trial twice at Manchester United",
      "Tottenham new boy Lucas Bergvall has previously been on trial twice at Manchester United - only to get overlooked.",
      "Bergvall looked set for Barcelona but the north Londoners swooped in to secure an £8.5million deal with Swedish side Djurgarden, who will keep the player until the end of this season, when he'll then make his way to Tottenham.",
      "Doubt over who would replace Xavi was a factor in why the 18-year-old rejected the Spain side amid concerns over the style implemented by the next coach. Before that though, United had the chance to land the teenager, as did Bayern Munich and Juventus, reports football.london.",
      "Three of Europe's giants saw Bergvall close up with Peter Kisfaludy, a leading academy figure at Djurgarden, eventually landing the teenager when he was coming through the ranks of Brommapojkarna, who also unearthed current Tottenham star Dejan Kulusevski.",
      "Bergvall has been described as a \"little copy of Frenkie de Jong\" such is his ability to play the ball in between the lines. That is the type of player Erik ten Hag has been desperate to land since arriving in Manchester, failing to land De Jong himself in his first summer.",
      "The former Ajax boss pushed hard to land De Jong, whom he'd worked with in Amsterdam, only for Barcelona to stand firm. The Dutchman has since remained at the Nou Camp with United still lacking a creative influence from deep in their midfield.",
      "Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou is understood to have played a major role in convincing Bergvall that a switch to the Premier League was the best move he could've made. A desire to give the teenager minutes is thought to have been a major motivator.",
      "Kisfaludy said: \"I think that the coach at Tottenham when he spoke to Lucas told him 'I love young talented players and if you work hard here I will give you the chance to play'. So I think that is really important when the head coach says that to an 18-year-old boy. I think that's a really, really good sign and an important thing to give the player, that warm feeling that they are going to take care of you.\"",
      "Bergvall will continue to play regularly for Djurgarden for the remainder of the season before his switch to north London, where he's been tipped to take six months to get up to the speed of England's top flight."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has devised a transfer strategy for Manchester United's summer window that will see the Red Devils target big names, but in cut-price deals with Joshua Kimmich on their radar",
      "Manchester United are planning to target players who are entering the final 12 months of their deal as part of a new strategy under Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Recruitment has been a major issue at Old Trafford for the past decade and it is an area the Ineos chief wants to get hold of and improve. United, who have given Erik ten Hag hefty sums to spend in his two summers in charge, again have money to spend.",
      "The club are looking to pursue players whose market values are likely to be less than usual due to their contract situations. Clubs are often willing to accept less for individuals who could leave for free in 12 months and they are who United will eye, which will ease the strain on their finances.",
      "A source told ESPN that the club's money situation remains \"tight\" despite efforts in January to cut the wage bill by offloading the likes of Jadon Sancho and Donny van de Beek on loan. United's strategy will see them target Bayern Munich duo Joshua Kimmich and Alphonso Davies.",
      "The pair have uncertain futures at the Allianz Arena as contract talks rumble on. Kimmich has been a mainstay at Bayern for years but is now being linked with both Manchester clubs. Davies, whilst of interest to United, is understood to favour a move to Real Madrid if he does move on.",
      "Lille forward Jonathan David, who has scored 39 goals in the last 18 months for the French side, is a forward on United's radar. Nice's Khephren Thuram was linked with Liverpool in the summer and is another man on the Old Trafford shortlist due to his contract winding down.",
      "Ratcliffe's strategy could also see him consider moves for the likes of Ivan Toney, Juventus ' Federico Chiesa and Ten Hag's compatriot Denzel Dumfries - all of whom will see their deals expire in 2025.",
      "United were alerted to Mason Mount's situation last summer which led to them pursuing the former Chelsea midfielder, who had been unable to agree a new deal at Stamford Bridge. That somewhat forced the Blues' hand and they were forced to sell to a direct rival.",
      "Ten Hag's record in the transfer window thus far has been very hit and miss. He spent big on the likes of Antony and Andre Onana, two men who've failed to match expectations. Questions are also being asked of the decision to sign Casemiro in his first summer in charge.",
      "Ratcliffe and his INEOS team have. begun planning for the summer despite not yet appointing a new director of football, although they plan to do so in the coming weeks with the likes of Michael Edwards, formerly of Liverpool, and Newcastle's Dan Ashworth among those linked."

      "Atletico Madrid are considering a summer move for Mason Greenwood as they try to bolster their forward line.",
      "The 22-year-old, who joined Getafe on loan from Manchester United in September, has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 22 appearances this season. Greenwood netted the opener from the penalty spot in Getafe's 1-1 draw at Real Betis on Sunday - six days after finding the net against Granada.",
      "Greenwood has been impressive at Getafe and his form is attracting interest from Atletico as well as other La Liga rivals, including Barcelona. According to The Telegraph, Greenwood is on Atletico's list of forward transfer targets after a deal for ex-Everton striker Moise Kean fell through during the January window.",
      "Back in August, United agreed for Greenwood to resume his career away from Old Trafford after they concluded an internal six-month investigation. The striker was arrested in October 2022 and was subsequently charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Those charges were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "Getafe announced the signing of Greenwood on transfer deadline day and he has made an impact after returning to football for the first time in 20 months. He grabbed an assist on his first start for the club against Athletic Bilbao, before scoring his first goal in a 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo on October 8.",
      "Greenwood has less than 18 months left on his deal at United and could leave on a permanent deal in the summer. Getafe are thought to be keen to secure the long-term services of Greenwood, while Barcelona are also interested in the forward despite their limited spending power in the transfer market.",
      "Last Thursday, Greenwood was in the spotlight when Getafe filled a complaint after Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham allegedly called him a \"rapist\". La Liga have launched an official investigation into the slur aimed at Greenwood.",
      "Speaking on Saturday, Getafe boss Jose Bordales defended Greenwood, who went on to score in the 1-1 draw against Betis. \"I know the same thing that you know,\" Bordalos told a press conference. \"It's not up to me, it's the club, La Liga and the (Spanish Football) Federation (RFEF) that have to make an assessment about it.",

      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has allowed Joe Lewis to train with his senior squad as the veteran goalkeeper looks to keep up his fitness levels.",
      "Lewis, 36, has been without a club since leaving Aberdeen at the end of last season. The England under-21 international played his only Premier League game a decade ago, while at Cardiff City, while his only senior England call-up in 2008 didn't result in any game time under Fabio Capello.",
      "The veteran had been working on his fitness with United's under-21s before the turn of the year, according to the MEN, but more recently asked to join the seniors. His request was granted by Erik ten Hag, with the same publication reporting that Ten Hag allowed Lewis to join backup keepers Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton in a session for players not involved from the start against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "United are relatively well-stocked in goal, with no indication Lewis' training will lead to a contract offer. However, veteran defender Jonny Evans was able to earn a deal at Old Trafford after initially coming in to train alongside senior squad members.",
      "Lewis spent seven years with Aberdeen, making more than 200 appearances in the Scottish top flight. He also made more than 20 European appearances for the club, the last of them coming in a 2021-22 Europa Conference League defeat to Qarabag.",
      "“I’ve got so many good memories here at Aberdeen, both on and off the field, and I’ve made many friends within the club, so it feels quite emotional to be moving,\" Lewis said upon leaving Aberdeen last summer. \"I have no regrets; I’ve always tried my hardest every time I wore the shirt and I’m enormously proud to have captained the club and played as many games as I did.",
      "“The supporters took to me immediately and during the last seven years have stuck with me through thick and thin so I’d sincerely like to thank them. The people of Aberdeen in general have been so welcoming to my family so whilst we’ll be leaving the city, we won’t be strangers.\"",
      "Is there any chance of Joe Lewis earning a Man Utd deal? Give your thoughts in the comments section",
      "United added Bayindir and Andre Onana to their ranks last summer, but also allowed several keepers to leave the club. Dean Henderson was sold to Crystal Palace and Matej Kovar joined Bayer Leverkusen, while David de Gea left as a free agent after his contract expired.",
      "Heaton is one of the players who remained at Old Trafford, with the club triggering a one-year extension. However, before that happened, he cast doubt over his longer-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "“I love it here,\" he said. \"I have been part of this football club for a long time, but I can't lie, I also love playing. We will have a sit down and chat and see where we go.\"",
      "United have been tipped to add at least one new goalkeeper over the summer, though anyone coming in would do so knowing they're arriving as a back-up to first-choice Onana. For now, though, Lewis is taking advantage of the situation to stay sharp for whenever his next contract offer comes around."

      "Erik ten Hag has been left with a major selection headache after Lisandro Martinez's injury, with Harry Maguire set to step into the starting line-up while the Argentine is sidelined",
      "The enforced loss of Lisandro Martinez for at least eight weeks is the latest blow in an injury-cursed season for Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "There is no doubt United's progress in their second season under Ten Hag has been compromised by a consistent loss of key personnel to injuries, particularly at the back. Ten Hag has been without Martinez, Luke Shaw, Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Tyrell Malacia for sustained spells, the United boss unable to pick a consistent side, but unwilling to use it as an excuse for his side's failings this season.",
      "Martinez's latest injury, a medial collateral ligament strain in his right knee, was sustained in United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, with the hope he can be back in action for the season run-in.",
      "Martinez and Varane had emerged as Ten Hag's first-choice central defensive pairing, but the former's second serious injury of the campaign is likely to see Maguire get the nod to partner Varane.",
      "Varane and Maguire are facing uncertain futures, with both potentially on their way in the summer, but the way in which the latter has revived his United career suggests he may well stay put. Ten Hag's decision to take the captaincy off Maguire in the summer and hand the role to Bruno Fernandes marked a new low in the England star's turbulent United career.",
      "Jettisoned for much of last season, Maguire looked set to leave United last summer, but turned down the chance of a move to West Ham and elected to stay and fight for his place. That decision was vindicated when Martinez was sidelined for a long spell after United's 4-3 defeat at Bayern Munich in September, although Ten Hag opted for Varane, Lindelof and Evans in the immediate aftermath.",
      "Yet Maguire soon proved himself to be the most reliable centre-back – form and fitness-wise – in the absence of the injured Martinez and started 14 games in a row for United in all competitions.",
      "From looking like he had chosen a season on the bench, one with England's Euro 2024 campaign at the end of it, Maguire had managed to reinvent himself and remind United of his enduring value.",
      "Injury would ultimately afflict Maguire in mid December, keeping him out for eight games, but his renaissance this season suggests he is likely to be retained by Ten Hag and United in the summer. The same cannot be said of Varane with the same sense of conviction, with the France World Cup winner the most likely of United's central defenders to be on the move this summer.",
      "Despite his stature and experience, Varane's form has been patchy this season and he has been a hostage to a succession of minor injuries and ailments which have interrupted his campaign.",
      "United are looking to recruit a centre-back this summer to partner Martinez next season, which indicates at least one of Varane, Maguire and Lindelof will go, with Jonny Evans also set to leave when his one-year deal expires at the end of the campaign.",
      "With a year left on his current deal, United could recoup a decent fee for Varane, whom they signed from Real Madrid for £41million in the summer of 2021, while keeping Maguire and possibly Lindelof.",
      "The next few weeks are likely to have a big say on which defenders stay at United and which are moved on this summer, with Maguire, Varane, Lindelof and Evans all with a point to prove in the enforced absence of Martinez."

      "\"We have Omari (Forson), we have Amad Diallo, of course, we have Rashford who can play there. I think for the rest, all the positions are occupied. But, yeah, we have to be a little bit creative if it's up to the number nine position.\"",
      "However, United are set to be active ahead of next season as Ratcliffe's £1.25bn purchase of a 25 per cent stake took another step forward, with his shares coming with enhanced voting powers. The vote was a necessary step before the completion of deal with Ratcliffe and Ineos.",
      "Planning for the summer is already taken shape and though the club are looking to complete signings, the pursestrings could remain tight. That will see the 13-times Premier League champions target players with less than 12 months on their contract.",

      "The Manchester Evening News understands renovation of the 114-year-old stadium would be complicated due to the railway lines and the existing structures. Although sources have suggested enhancing the stadium would be more cost-efficient than rebuilding it, the expense would still be considerable and more time-consuming.",

      "A new Old Trafford would be a higher capital cost but provide a better return on the investment and could be constructed while Old Trafford is still in use, as Tottenham did with White Hart Lane while their new stadium was under construction next door. That would prevent United from playing in front of reduced-capacity crowds.",
      "Spurs moved out of White Hart Lane in 2017 and resided at Wembley until their new stadium opened in March 2019 due to a string of delays.",
      "United hired stadium masterplanners Populous to present proposals for an expanded Old Trafford in April 2022. As revealed by the Manchester Evening News last year, rebuilding the stadium would enable United to rotate Old Trafford and maximise the site's footprint.",

      "With structural and personnel changes expected once the Ineos Group receive regulatory approval from the Premier League, it is unclear if Populous's proposals will be sanctioned by Ineos chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "Man Utd could soon welcome back their £60m summer signing but his role in the team is not so sure.",
      "Mason Mount will soon be available again for Manchester United. You might not notice right away. He has been sidelined since November 11 with a calf problem and last started a Premier League game on October 7. It's not exactly the return Erik ten Hag hoped for when he identified him as his top midfield target a year ago.",
      "Mount joined United from Chelsea for £60million in the last summer window and has been 'struggling' with injury issues since August. It begs the question of how much United knew of the extent of his injury issues before he joined.",
      "The England international did not start in any of Chelsea's last 18 matches of the 2022–23 campaign due to a pubis injury, and he has started nine games in the last year, completing 90 minutes only once. It would be a surprise if he played a full game before the end of the campaign.",
      "That's not because of further fitness concerns, but because of the fact he won't be starting matches in the first place. What is so alarming is that even when he is fit, it is hard to see exactly where he fits into the United side, a problem that has worsened during his spell on the sidelines.",
      "Mount was signed to be the link man in midfield, tasked with progressing the play from defence to attack and bringing composure to the role. Kobbie Mainoo has proven to be that man instead.",
      "In the five matches that Mount and Casemiro played together at the start of the campaign, United struggled for a midfield presence, with the duo struggling to match the physicality of the Premier League.",
      "Mount's case is again not helped by the fact teenager Mainoo has shone with his physicality as well as his ball-playing ability, showcasing both silk and steel during his senior breakthrough.",
      "The former Chelsea midfielder is now a backup at best for United, behind Mainoo in the progressive midfield role and still behind club captain Bruno Fernandes in the more advanced attacking midfield role too.",
      "It is not necessarily the biggest blow to have a player like Mount on the bench, though it once again undermines Ten Hag's own eye for talent and the huge amount of money invested in a squad player, which left them short of funds to strengthen the squad in the January window.",
      "Mount is also not helped by the fact United look to have finally solved their right-wing dilemma. Up until late December, there was no outstanding candidate to occupy the right-flank role, a position that he had shone in during his time at Chelsea.",
      "The 25-year-old looked like an ideal big-game player thanks to his energy, pressing ability, and defensive discipline, but Ten Hag will favour the attacking threat of Alejandro Garnacho in that position instead.",
      "There could still be occasions in which United decide Mount is worthy of a position switch out wide to help them against some strong possession-based opponents, though there are few opportunities for that to be tested between now and the end of the season.",
      "As he nears a return to injury, Mount will be desperate to make up for lost time. The bad news for him is that others made the most of it instead.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is getting to work on transforming Man Utd but his plans for long-term progress have been made easier since the deal was announced.",
      "When the deal handing Ineos 25% of Manchester United was confirmed on Christmas Eve their to-do list was both long and unappealing. The beginning of the end for the Glazers was toasted by supporters over the festive period, but the situation remained grim.",
      "Defeat to Nottingham Forest in the final game of 2023 made it five defeats in December for Erik ten Hag’s side and while Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford were busy getting to work behind the scenes, what was unfolding in front of them on the pitch would have been causing more immediate concern.",
      "Ratcliffe is still waiting for regulatory approval for his minority investment to go through but his fingerprints are all over every major decision United have made in the last six-and-a-half weeks, most of them focused on bringing long-term success back to Old Trafford.",
      "But while Brailsford’s review of football operations at the club and Ratcliffe’s attempts to put the football front and centre once again were worthy attempts at bringing some kind of order back to the club, their task was only going to be made more difficult by getting the reins in a season that was threatening to become an unmitigated disaster.",
      "On Christmas Eve they inherited a manager under pressure, a £72million striker who couldn’t score and a team that lost as often as they won. They were out of Europe already and threatening to not even qualify for continental competition in 2024/25.",
      "With their compliance with the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) already tight, such a scenario was daunting. It would have a significant affect on this summer’s budget at a time when United need to spend to get back in the top four.",
      "But as the day the keys are officially cut for Ineos gets closer, the situation is looking up. Perhaps the two short-term scenarios they least wanted to countenance are no longer looking quite so problematic.",
      "Ratcliffe and Brailsford’s initial discussions with Ten Hag were positive and results are improving, as the Dutchman suggested they would when the injury situation eased. He isn’t out of the woods yet, the collapse at Wolves before Kobbie Mainoo’s intervention was concerning and although the win at West Ham was an example of the clinical finishing they’ve been missing, they still allowed the visitors to have 22 shots at Old Trafford.",
      "But four wins in five games have eased the pressure on Ten Hag and suggested he might just be the man to oversee the Ineos era on the pitch. The last thing Ratcliffe wanted was to have to consider a change in manager while looking for a new sporting director. He desperately wants - and needs - Ten Hag to steady the ship and reassert his own credentials.",
      "With no prospect of managerial change to consider, the planning for the summer transfer window becomes easier - especially with a new sporting director appointed in plenty of time. United do need to get away from allowing Ten Hag the level of control he has over recruitment decisions, with too many of his signings not working out.",
      "But one that is certainly paying off is the decision to back Hojlund this summer. The signing of an inexperienced 20-year-old striker to lead the line at United was a gamble but that roll of the dice is certainly looking better.",
      "United still need another striker this summer, but Hojlund has now scored in four successive Premier League appearances and is up to 10 goals for the season. He is beginning to look like the frontman Ten Hag and football director John Murtough thought he could be.",
      "If the Dane can maintain that form until the end of the season, then the focus this summer will be on signing competition for him, rather than needing to consider another elite striker to score the goals required at United. Hojlund suddenly looks like he might be that man and that change in status could save the club millions this summer.",
      "With no decision to be made over a new manager and no need to break the bank on a first-choice striker, the in-tray for Ineos could be looking better. It will allow Ratcliffe to focus on infrastructure developments at Old Trafford and Carrington and on getting the right personnel in the right positions. The weeks between confirmation of the deal and approval from the Premier League have gone as well as could have been hoped for.",

Asked about the club's toughest nights in Europe, Neville recalled on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet: \"There are a couple which sticks in my mind, I am going to say this for legal reasons, I think there were a few teams we played against who weren’t clean.

Mainoo has become a key figure in United manager Erik ten Hag's thinking in the last few months and has scored two goals in his last three matches.",

He had the courage to try something different in the last minute of the game and it was a special moment.",

      "If you had said in the early '00s that Old Trafford would not be one of the venues for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland's joint Euro 2028 bid, many would have rightly laughed. However, this was the reality last year as it was overlooked in the North West by Manchester City's Etihad Stadium and Everton's new Bramley-Moore Dock development.",

      "In the meantime, United must cope without their only senior centre half certain of remaining at the club next season. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans are out of contract in June, Victor Lindelof is next year and the next three months will have a big bearing on Maguire's future.",
      "Rewatching Jarrod Bowen's one-on-one that Diogo Dalot thwarted against West Ham, there are eerie parallels with Watkins's goal. The aerial ball evades Maguire far too easily.",
      "It was not his only lapse. He was on the back foot, rather than the front, in receiving a pass at 1-0 that Emerson Palmieri seized on. We have seen Maguire do that before (Leicester away, October 2021). The only difference was it did not lead to a goal.",
      "Watkins enjoyed a more rhythmic Saturday night than Whigfield at Bramall Lane, scoring one and creating another two goals. Watkins has 11 goals and 10 assists in the Premier League this season and is the first Villa player to break double figures for those metrics in the top flight since Dwight Yorke in 1995-96.",
      "Had Watkins, 28, not extended his contract with Villa by another five years in October he would be beeping on the radars of the elite clubs. Nobody will go near him now. Premier League-proven striker + England international + current top-four club = nine-figure valuation.",
      "Watkins was on a streak of 11 goals in 14 games when Villa returned to M16 in the Premier League last April. United's back four consisted of three full-backs and one centre back but they neutered Watkins and their sheet stayed clean in a 1-0 win.",
      "Lindelof and Luke Shaw, the defensive axis, were paired together for the third game running that afternoon. Lindelof started the last 12 games of last season in what was his finest run of form for the club while Shaw showed he is almost as good at centre back as he is at left-back.",
      "The likelihood is it will be a completely different pairing at Villa Park. Varane was rested against West Ham as, in the words of one high-profile United source, \"Varane has said, 'I can't do this any more.'\" That would be starting twice in a week.",
      "Maguire's two near-costly errors blemished an otherwise accomplished return on his first start in nearly nine weeks at the weekend.

Maguire has shown commendable resilience and was the Premier League Player of the Month for November.",

      "Lindelof also recently returned from a long lay-off of 10 weeks, having undergone groin surgery in December. Evans was in the directors' box rather than the dugout against West Ham, pushed back down the pecking order after a prominent period.",

      "Another emotive rendition of The Flowers of Manchester from Pete Martin followed and a chorus of 'we'll never die, we'll never die' broke out after the performance. There was a visible mix of young and old supporters gathered to pay their respects. It is essential for any young United fan to be educated about the Munich air disaster.",
      "Jimmy Murphy's son, Paddy Crerand, Brian Kidd and John Murtough were among the other notable attendees. As Sir Matt Busby fought for his life in hospital after the disaster, Murphy became caretaker manager and promised that United would rebuild and enjoy a prosperous future.",
      "\"The Red Devils will rise again\" Murphy said just days after the crash. \"It took Matt Busby, Bert Whalley and myself 13 years to produce the 1958 Red Devils. It was long, tiring, hard work.

But we'll do it.\"",
      "Murphy was right and United did rebuild. Sir Bobby Charlton was at the centre of that and following his passing in October, this year’s anniversary was the first without any living disaster survivors. Charlton miraculously survived the crash and carried that trauma his entire life. Rev Boyers touched on Charlton's passing and a tribute to others who passed in the last year was paid.",
      "That included Lady Cathy Ferguson, the wife of Sir Alex, who passed away last year. The crowd broke into applause and Ferguson solemnly bowed his head and uttered 'thank you'.",
      "Ferguson and Ratcliffe exchanged words at the end of the ceremony. Ratcliffe was born in Failsworth, grew up supporting United and was six years old when the Munich disaster happened. It was a classy touch for Ratcliffe to attend and representation at the ceremony from INEOS will not go unnoticed by fans, who have become accustomed to absent custodians.",

      "LaLiga responded to the incident in a statement: \"LaLiga is going to report the incident to the Public Prosecutor's Office for minors as it involves a minor. The police have already identified him.\"",
      "Rayo also released a statement, condemning the behaviour of the fan. The club said: \"This isolated action is solely the individual responsibility of the fan who carried it out, with neither Rayo Vallecano nor any of the other almost 15,000 spectators who filled the Estadio de Vallecas for the match against Sevilla having any responsibility for it and who had exemplary behaviour.",
      "\"Rayo Vallecano at this time is working to identify the fan so that, if he is a season ticket holder, it can adopt the appropriate disciplinary measures according to the internal regulations.",

      "Man Utd will be without their best defender for the third time since he joined the club in the summer of 2022.",
      "The fact so many rival fans appear to be revelling in Lisandro Martinez's latest injury setback shows just how feared he is.",
      "Without him, Manchester United are an inferior side, and of all the players they have had to cope without this season, he is the one they have missed the most.",
      "Martinez did not steal the show in any of the four games he played after making his brief return from injury, yet in all of them he still shone in an understated way, passing the ball with ease and opening up other avenues of attack that were often overlooked.",
      "United's latest setback is a huge blow to their slim hopes of Champions League qualification and further bad luck for Erik ten Hag in a season when he has had to constantly adapt his team selections.",
      "MOST READ: Greenwood responds to Bellingham incident after loanee backed",
      "It is also a reminder of the balancing act Ten Hag treads. His own hopes of success rely on Martinez, but he is slowly becoming a player who cannot be relied upon all the time. For all of his unquestionable talent, the best ability is availability. Martinez hasn't been known for that during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "The Argentina international has missed 34 matches across two serious injury setbacks, and it could be around 42 by the time he is next back in action. It means he has already been injured for 35.78% of matches since he joined the club, and it will stand at 40.77% if he misses the next eight matches as well.",
      "Martinez is not injury-prone in the traditional sense of a player who breaks down a lot, but is injury-prone as a byproduct of his gladiatorial style of play. He plays with his heart on his sleeve and the pride of his family flowing through his veins, an ice-cold conviction countered by a heated passion to give everything he has for the greater good of the team.",
      "It is that tenacity that makes Martinez the fan favourite he is, yet it leaves him so susceptible to the type of injury he suffered against West Ham. If you take those chaotic confrontations out of his game, he probably suffers fewer injuries, but his game would also suffer.",
      "'The Butcher' needs an edge. He needs a 90-minute nemesis, someone who can incite the volatile side of him and bring him as close to the mark as possible. It is in those murky channels that he plays his best, yet at the same time he is so close to overstepping the line as well.",
      "Martinez's absence is also another tactical blow for a United side that has lacked identity all season. Ten Hag is a firm believer in having a left-footed centre-back whenever possible because it allows them to receive the ball easier and offer up a host of different passing angles, both of which are crucial to building from the back.",
      "''Because the left-footed are better orientated on the left side, in possession you then have better angles,\" he said during his first summer at the club. \"But out of possession also the orientation is better and the angles are more comfortable to cut out and cover for a full-back.''",
      "It is this reasoning that means Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, and Victor Lindelof could all be likelier replacements for Martinez than Harry Maguire, given the better balance it will provide the backline.",
      "At the same time, it only further highlights the importance of Martinez to this United side and the tricky task Ten Hag faces of utilising him to his full potential while also trying to smooth those rough edges.",
      "When he is fit, Martinez is United's best defender. It means he isn't anymore.",

      "That post-match interview with Maguire came after an England victory at Hampden Park, a game in which the defender was targeted by Scotland fans throughout the 90 minutes.",
      "Maguire was ridiculed whenever he got the ball. Gareth Southgate was seething and said, “I have never known a player to be treated in this way,\" when speaking to the press.",
      "The defender was stripped of the captaincy by Erik ten Hag last summer and he remained down the pecking order at United when playing that game for England.",
      "However, just a few weeks later, he started his first game of the Premier League season against Brentford and assisted the match-winning goal, which was the start of his renaissance.",
      "Maguire started the next 13 games in all competitions and that run was only brought to an end when he sustained an injury against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.",
      "His redemption arc gathered pace in October when he scored against FC Copenhagen at Old Trafford, a crucial contribution which gave United hope of progressing from the group.",
      "The 30-year-old has enjoyed a strong campaign and he's no longer the butt of jokes for opposition fans. His resilience has been impressive and he deserves immense praise for his attitude.",
      "West Ham were interested in signing Maguire but the move didn't materialise and it seemed unlikely he would regain the trust of Ten Hag after becoming the fifth choice in his position.",
      "Maguire made just eight league starts last season and he was demoralised by a natural left-back, Luke Shaw, being selected over him in the centre of defence on various occasions.",
      "Nobody expected Maguire to rise up the pecking order again, but his consistent performances combined with injuries to Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane have seen that happen.",
      "Maguire was absent himself during the festive period after picking up a groin injury, but he's now fit again and he started in the 3-0 victory over West Ham.",
      "Although there were a few shaky moments on his return to action, Maguire delivered another decent display and he will be needed in the coming weeks, especially after Martinez's injury.",
      "Martinez has sustained an injury to the medial collateral ligament in his knee and is set to be sidelined for at least two months. That is a huge blow but it could have been worse.",
      "The worst possible outcome was feared for Martinez, who had only just returned from a lay-off, when he went to the ground with a knee injury in the second half on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Martinez is key to how Ten Hag wants to play and his ability to pass through the lines is invaluable. His absence will be felt, so his teammates must step up while he recovers again.",
      "Last season, Maguire coming into the team would have been a cause for concern, but he's put a torrid few years behind him to play his best football since working under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "It's fair to say Maguire could be considered the surprise package of the campaign, given his limited involvement last term, the stripping of his captaincy and that he was expected to leave.",
      "Nobody expected a renaissance and the player's mental strength has been the reason for that. Maguire might have the last laugh yet.",

      "Erik ten Hag had called for consistency from Alejandro Garnacho and the Man Utd teenager is starting to deliver just that.",
      "For every young footballer, there is a moment when the penny drops. A game or an action when the path to greatness can become just that little clearer. Sometimes it's a setback, often it's an act that can show them just how much potential is contained within.",
      "With Alejandro Garnacho, that moment is increasingly looking like the third minute of Manchester United's 3-0 win at Everton in November. That spectacular overhead kick to silence a seething Goodison Park should already have wrapped up the goal of the season award and for the Argentine, it has kickstarted his most productive spell in a United shirt.",
      "That goal was the first of six, along with two assists, that Garnacho has delivered in his last 15 games. That's a reasonable return but most importantly it's an improving one as well. The teenager is beginning to influence games to a greater degree this season and he doesn't turn 20 until July.",
      "Garnacho is now on a run of 19 successive starts dating back to November 1, which is a remarkable statistic when you consider that before then he had only ever begun two successive matches for United. For a long time, he was a super sub, a player capable of making an impact off the bench but who was strangely subdued when he started. No longer.",
      "Until that goal at Everton, four of Garnacho's six for United had come as a sub and all four of his assists had been as a replacement. A year ago Ten Hag was calling for more goals and more assists and the winger was someone who if he did start tended to be replaced.",
      "Before he started this run of 19 games in a row, he had completed 90 minutes just twice for United, against Charlton Athletic and Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup. Five times in this streak of games he has now completed 90 minutes, but in 12 of them he has made it until the 84th minute at least.",
      "This is a sign of a player starting to deliver more regularly. The game after his Everton wonder goal he scored at Galatasaray. He struck twice in a scintillating performance against Aston Villa and then twice more against West Ham on Sunday. What was particularly telling about his impact at the weekend was that he didn't play particularly well in the first half. When that has happened previously he has drifted out of games, but now he has the belief and the confidence to keep going and put it behind him.",
      "After that stunner on Merseyside there were inevitable comparisons with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, the last two teenage sensations to make an impact at United. Ten Hag refused to get involved too heavily in that discussion but did point out where Garnacho could improve.",
      "“Don’t compare, I don’t think it is right,” he said. “They all have their own identity but for Garnacho to go that way he has a lot to come, he has to work very hard.",
      "\"You have to do it on a consistent basis and so far he has not. But he definitely has high potential to do some amazing things. It's not the first time we saw this, we have already often seen glimpses but if you want to be a player like Rooney or Ronaldo you have to score 20 [or] 25 goals in the Premier League each season.",
      "\"That's not easy to get, you have to work hard, you have to go in areas where it hurts. So [there is] a lot to come. But potential, he has.\"",
      "Twenty goals will be beyond him this season, but the consistency is coming into his game. He has earned his run in the team and appears undroppable now. What is particularly telling is the way he has adapted to a right-wing role, having been used almost exclusively on the left until his superb Boxing Day performance against Villa. In November 2022, Garnacho expressed his preference for that left-wing role and explained why he wanted to play there.",
      "“I’ve always liked to play out wide on the left, as a right-footed player able to cut inside,” he told club media. “To be able to play as a right-footed player down the left, you also have to be pretty decent with your weaker foot.",
      "\"From an early age, I’ve always practiced hard using both feet, because that makes you into a much better player and so nowadays I can play with both feet – not to perfection but to a good standard.\"",
      "That practice is paying off now. His doubles against Villa and West Ham included a goal with either foot and his strike in Istanbul was with his left foot. So of those six goals, half were with his right and half with his left.",
      "There's no doubt Garnacho is now part of United's best front three, keeping £85million winger Antony out of the team. There is still more to come from the 19-year-old, but it does feel like his wonder strike back in November might have been a turning point in his fledgling career.",

      "Eintracht have the option to buy Van de Beek for €11million (£9.55m), with €3m (£2.6m) in add-ons, so it was possible that he'd played his last game for Manchester United, but his underwhelming start in Germany suggests a permeant deal might not materialise.",
      "Van de Beek started his first two games for Eintracht and was hooked at half-time in his third appearance. He subsequently lost his starting role against Koln.",

      "Van de Beek described his time in Manchester as 'tough', but it looks like there is no respite in Frankfurt and being snubbed from their Conference League squad represents a new low.",
      "“He has had many injuries, first of all,” Ten Hag recently said about Van de Beek. \"From the first moment I came in here at Manchester United, he wasn’t the player he was at Ajax because he was injured. So many times he was not available and then he struggled for a long time to recover from that injury.",
      "“That is probably the main reason why he was not playing. We decided for a loan in the summer but it didn’t come and then his opportunities are few because also we make appointments and we make agreements with players and contract players in that position. The competition was high.”",
      "Ten Hag blamed injuries for Van de Beek's regression, but he was available for the entirety of United's pre-season in 2022 and named on the bench in the Dutchman's first four fixtures.",
      "The bottom line is Van de Beek was not good enough for United and although it was thought German football would suit him, he might have to accept another drop in level.",
      "Remarkably, Van de Beek was a Ballon d'Or nominee in 2019 after his influential role in Ajax's domestic double triumph and progression to the Champions League semi-finals.",

      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",

      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",

United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "Jadon Sancho's time at Man United is coming to an end after his public disagreement with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",
      "The Frenchman has shown Sancho how to react.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Former centre-back Rio Ferdinand fears the loss of Lisandro Martinez to injury risks derailing Manchester United's momentum.",
      "The Argentine is expected to face a minimum of eight weeks on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury in Sunday's 3-0 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford. The defender was forced off with just under 20 minutes remaining after his knee buckled under the weight of Hammers right-back Vladimir Coufal.",
      "A statement released by United on Monday said: \"Lisandro Martinez has sustained an injury to the medial collateral ligament in his knee and is expected to be out of action for at least eight weeks.\"",
      "Martinez, who was signed from Ajax in July 2022, was making just his fourth appearance since returning from a foot injury that had seen him sidelined since September. After returning via the bench against Tottenham Hotspur last month, he started the FA Cup win over Newport County before featuring from the start in the Premier League wins against Wolves and West Ham.",
      "He was excellent in both meaning his presence at the back will be sorely missed over the coming weeks. And for Ferdinand, it is a huge blow to United's hopes of maintaining their recent run of good form, not least because it dismantles his left-sided relationship with Luke Shaw.",
      "Ferdinand, speaking on Vibe with Five ahead of United's official statement on Martinez being released, said: \"He got a little injury. He's done his knee. I see he tweaked it. I think that looks like ligaments. He tried to carry on and then said, 'No, no, no I've got to go'. So, listen, if he's out, it kills it.",
      "\"You can see with him and Luke Shaw on that side, when they're together, they look so dominant, they look so confident, they look so composed with the ball. And those two are really good with the ball in terms of setting up attacks, the ball generally comes from that side.",
      "\"Any of the good stuff United do, Martinez, even you see for the first goal, he clips it in. Yes it goes to [Kurt] Zouma and he heads it down and Casemiro intercepts and we get the goal off that, but it's because Martinez is playing forward, he's playing forceful passes. So that will be disappointing. United have had so many injuries and he's one of them that's been out of a while and he's probably one of their most influential players.\"",

      "Manchester United have been seeking to replicate Sir Alex Ferguson's success since the day he left Old Trafford for the final time. This weekend they will need to heed a warning from the United great.",
      "The Reds won the last of their Premier League titles in Ferguson's final season a decade ago and won't be ending that drought this term. Instead, the focus for Erik ten Hag and his squad is to try and ensure Champions League football next season with United currently sixth but looking upwards after a 3-0 weekend win over West Ham.",
      "Seven goals and six points in four days has raised optimism of a strong finish for the Reds, who have struggled for much of this season. Early exits from Europe and the Carabao Cup raised the pressure on Ten Hag but United, led by exciting young talents Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, are targeting a strong finish to a campaign which could also yield a trophy in the FA Cup.",

The Reds great spoke to NBC Sports ahead of United's season opener against Wolves and had nothing but positive words for Villa, despite the fact they'd been beaten 5-1 by Newcastle on the opening weekend.",
      "\"To be honest with you, I watched Aston Villa and I can't believe the scoreline. Honestly Aston Villa played fantastic football and just lost to bad goals,\" Ferguson said.",
      "\"Newcastle are going to be very difficult to beat, in their own ground in particular, and their manager has done a great job there. It's a surprising game, football. You can play teams off the pitch and not score - that's what Aston Villa did.\"",

Bergvall turned down Barcelona to agree a move to Spurs on transfer deadline day, but his switch from Swedish top-tier club Djurgardens won't be official until the summer.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has a case to be viewed as Manchester United's most important player but there are other candidates",
      "Erik ten Hag vowed that Manchester United's results and performance levels would improve once he recovered a crop of key players from injury.",
      "Following Sunday's 3-0 triumph over West Ham United, United have now won each of their last three matches, plundering 11 goals in the process. Some of the football on show, particularly in the first half at Wolves last week, has been been among the best they have produced all season.",
      "United's upturn in fortunes has coincided with the returns of the likes of Luke Shaw and Casemiro. Lisandro Martinez, too, had more than played his part up until suffering another injury problem in the win over the Hammers.",
      "The Argentine faces at least eight weeks on the sidelines with a knee problem, meaning his return from a previous injury has been cut frustratingly short. It means Ten Hag must now find a solution to limit the impact of his absence.",
      "Martinez, in the opinion of many, has been United's most successful signing of the Ten Hag era thus far. Therefore, MEN Sport's football writers have had their say on which player they believe United cannot afford to be without.",
      "Right now, it has to be Rasmus Hojlund. For all the other issues within the United squad, the biggest problem has so often been a lack of goals and a focal point of attack, and he has helped to address it.",
      "After a difficult start at the club, the 21-year-old has now hit his stride and has been a big part of everything they have done right in recent weeks. What is most pleasing is that he is scoring all different types of goals and is getting better with every one that finds the net.",
      "Ultimately, a lot of the other issues in the squad can be glossed over as long as goals are being scored, and Hojlund is a vital cog to United’s hopes for the remainder of the season. He’d be starting every game even if they had another fit striker; the fact that they don’t just makes him that bit more important.",
      "United have a lot of important individuals within their ranks, but are any of them more influential than Martinez? It is not often you consider a centre-back to be quite so valuable but the Argentine is paramount to the way Ten Hag likes his team to play.",
      "As well as being an aggressive, well-rounded defender, his ball-playing ability is top-notch. His left foot is capable of opening up angles that United would not otherwise be able to find.",
      "He is an excellent passer of the ball and he is comfortable striding out from the back with possession and moving into midfield. That was highlighted in the build-up to the first goal against West Ham.",
      "Furthermore, Matinez, over time, has formed a solid partnership with Shaw at left-back. Between them, they form 50 per cent of United's strongest back-four and are critical to United's build-up play in the first phase, progressing the ball from deep.",
      "What Martinez lacks in height, he makes up for in technical ability. Had his first season at Old Trafford not been cut short by a foot injury last April, he would have been a worthy contender for the team of the season.",
      "Martinez's first stint out of the side this season proved he is the most important player for United at present. Last season, the Reds were defensively sound. Even if they were goal-shy, you could rely on the defensive partnership of Martinez and Raphael Varane to see them through.",
      "However, United struggled to find an appropriate alternative to the Argentine in his injury absence. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw were all experimented in the centre of defence and while each player has had their moments, they don't inspire the same confidence as Martinez.",
      "He is tenacious and conducts himself with the sort of character on the pitch which United fans have come to expect from their team. When you go to Old Trafford, there seems to be a greater atmosphere from the stands when Martinez is on the pitch and he has barely put a foot wrong since arriving. United supporters will feel unsettled by his eight-week injury layoff and it will be interesting to see if those who remain can step up to the plate.",
      "United rely on Bruno Fernandes immeasurably. The midfielder, yet to miss a game through injury since his arrival four years ago, leads the goal contributions chart with 14 this season - seven goals and assists apiece.",
      "All three of his Premier League goals have been match-winners and, for all his animated on-field gesticulations, he is a loud and present leader on the pitch. United have looked devoid of creativity when Fernanades has been played out on the right wing, which has only happened three times this season.",
      "In the last three seasons, Fernandes has been missing for three games through suspension and United only managed to score once. His link-up play is vital to United’s forward play, and they would be worse off than they currently are without him.",
      "In the Premier League alone this season, Fernandes has completed 1,206 passes, more than 300 more than any f his team-mates. He has also had nearly 350 more touches than any other United player.",
      "Last season’s other top performers, Marcus Rashford and Casemiro, have both dropped off this season but Fernandes has remained consistent despite the mire. Goodness knows where the team would be without his input.",

      "Gary Neville has given his thoughts on the current crop of Man United youngsters, including Kobbie Mainoo, and he doesn't think they have the same support system he enjoyed",
      "Gary Neville has expressed his worries about the new generation of stars at Manchester United, saying they may struggle due to a lack of leaders in the dressing room.",
      "The former United player, who was part of the famous Class of 92, thinks that the current crop of young players like Kobbie Mainoo don't have the same support system he had. Mainoo has been a shining star for United this season, becoming a regular in Erik ten Hag's midfield.",
      "He's leading a group of young players, including Omari Forson, Willy Kambwala and Amad Diallo, who are all vying for starting positions despite their tender years. But Neville has raised his concerns about the players' development.",
      "\"It's a massive factor, the dressing room that you come into as a young player and the influence and standard bearers in the dressing room,\" Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"These [Manchester] United lads who have come through in the last five to eight years, if you’re a young lad coming through at Liverpool and Manchester City you’ve got a good chance, whereas if you’re at United now, you’re thinking who's guiding that dressing room.\"",
      "Former United captain Keane agrees with Neville's views on the current team under Ten Hag. He joined United from Nottingham Forest in 1993 and was instantly impressed by the dressing room atmosphere.",
      "\"I loved the dressing room,\" he said. \"I thought all these players were brilliant professionals, and I looked around and thought what a great group of people. Players like Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, all amazing professional players.",
      "\"Remember the Cliff, our old training ground in Salford, I'd come in for a big fee at the time, but I was looking around the group and even the chat and the banter was great. My first pre-season we went to South Africa, and I couldn't believe how brilliant It was and how good the players were.",
      "\"We're talking about plenty of players when we played who would happily give tough love, but clearly no one is doing that at Manchester United for Marcus Rashford and that is one of the problems that the team has, they don't have that core group of players.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is looking at ways to revolutionise the club once he is officially in charge, with talk of stadium redevelopment once again making headlines this week. The Manchester Evening News revealed last year United co-chairman Joel Glazer's preference is to preserve the heritage of the 113-year-old stadium with a renovation rather than a rebuild, though it has been suggested Ratcliffe favours the reverse.",
      "It will become a more pressing issue in the long term, as will the redevelopment options of the club's training facilities, with United open to relocating from their Carrington training complex due to the logistical issues of expanding the site. They are all important things to be taken care of in the years ahead, though they are sometimes a convenient distraction from the wider issues at play. Just ask former chief executive David Gill.",
      "OPINION: United set for new experiment without Martinez",
      "\"Trust me, that roof leaked when we were there, but we were top of the league, so it wasn't mentioned in the papers or media,\" Gill told the Rio Ferdinand Presents FIVE podcast.",
      "\"It leaked, whether it leaks a bit more now, I don't know, but all I'm saying is those sorts of things, success covers up a load of issues and we need to get back to that.\"",
      "The first thing to point out is that, while Gill is right, it has now been 11 years since he left his position, and it still hasn't been sorted out. It clearly needs doing at some point. However, he is correct that as long as things are going well on the pitch, a lot of the off-field matters are forgotten about amid more pressing issues.",
      "United might not be the best in class anymore, yet they are still judged by those standards. The smallest flaws are blown out of proportion when, at other clubs, they won't even be reported on. And issues that were present even during their success under Sir Alex Ferguson are now used to push a narrative of a club in decline.",
      "It is very easy to pile on the misery whenever United are in a perceived crisis by pointing out their dated training facilities and going overboard with criticism of their stadium. Sure, they are both past their best when compared with more modern builds, but Old Trafford's leaky roof and Cristiano Ronaldo's criticism of the training ground are not the reason why they haven't won a Premier League title since Gill left.",
      "They do serve as a timely reminder of the long-term project Ratcliffe will hope to oversee at his boyhood club, though his reign will ultimately be judged a success by whether or not he brings success back to the pitch. It's probable Ineos will arrive at a time when they won't benefit financially from Champions League qualification, and they'll need to sell in order to abide by Financial Fair Play rules this summer in addition to buying.",
      "It means delivering success off the pitch would be a lot easier and quicker to do initially, though it can't be used as a convenient distraction if there is not a marked improvement on it as well. Ratcliffe could score some easy wins upon arrival; he'll be judged by delivering the tough ones.",

      "Martinez, 26, picked up a nasty-looking knee injury in their 3-0 win over West Ham and Erik ten Hag said during his post-match press conference that things to not look too good for the defender. United have since confirmed that knee ligament damage will keep the popular Argentine out of action for eight weeks.",
      "With the defender's absence now confirmed, ten Hag must rethink his defensive set-up. But it's not the first time United have had to survive without the combative ex-Ajax man, and England regular Luke Shaw has proved a worthy deputy during previous setbacks.",
      "Speaking about playing Shaw centre-back last season, Ten Hag said: \"I think he did fabulous and was impressive. But we also know he's really good as a full-back. It's an extra option and that's always good for the team.",
      "\"I thought it was the best match with Rapha [Raphael Varane] and Shaw [in the game against Wolves last season].

      "Shaw has operated in the middle with Diogo Dalot at left-back more recently, but United also have Harry Maguire and Varane to factor in. Varane has returned to the team in recent matches, while fit-again Maguire came in for the World Cup winner against West Ham. Varane was the substitute chosen to replace Martinez after his injury blow.",

Fortunately, their position in the table has improved in recent matches thanks to ten Hag finally being able to implement the masterplan he has been dreaming of.",

Trusting younger players at Ajax earned him a good reputation and brought success in the Netherlands as well as Europe.",

He was left out of the matchday squad for a Copa del Rey clash with Atletico Madrid four days later, with a statement being made by manager Quique Sanchez Flores explaining why the 21-year-old would be missing for the foreseeable future.",
      "\"After being with him, talking to him and having seen his first minutes in Girona, we are going to give him the necessary space to understand where he is, that he is at Sevilla and what it means,\" Sanchez Flores said. \"He has to know where he is and we want to see him. We have spoken with him and we believe that he has to have some time to learn, we wanted to give him space, time for him to see things from the outside and then he will return to the squad.",
      "\"In the end they are kids who have come and suddenly and in a huge club like Sevilla in circumstances of maximum demand. And they need a bit of location. And that location may be seen better from the outside than from the inside. You should take a step to understand what we want.\"",
      "The club then performed a bizarre U-turn by including Hannibal in their next squad to take on Osasuna on January 28. Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido Carrasco then moved to clarify matters, saying: \"I think things have been blown out of proportion a little. We are very excited about Hannibal.",
      "\"The sports management chose him, he is one of the signings from the January window that excites us the most and we are convinced that Hannibal is going to make it at Sevilla. I feel like everything has its processes.",
      "\"He’s only been here a couple of weeks, it’s a new country, a new culture, a new city, a different way of training, a different coaching style. We are super excited about Hannibal and convinced he is going to play a lot and breakthrough here at our club.\"",
      "But a new dig was aimed at the Tunisian international on Sunday over his lack of playing time, with Sanchez Flores adding: \"I am explaining to you the situation that this team has, which is similar to the team where he comes from. A team with disorder, with bad results, where sacrifice is above talented virtues. Only with talent we have been defending a place in this division for two years. We need desire, order, ambition, desire to compete, and I try to transmit that to Hannibal. Sacrifice is probably not his best virtue, but we will find it...\"",
      "Seemingly regaining the trust of Sevilla, Hannibal returned to the first team for their La Liga clash with Rayo Vallecano on Monday night and played the final eight minutes of their 2-1 away win after being brought on as a substitute. It remains to be seen whether or not the United loanee will retain his place in the squad in the coming weeks and months. Sevilla possess an option to make this loan permanent at the end of the season, though such an arrangement would appear unlikely at this stage.",

      "“We have just negotiated an extension with Adidas, a great deal there, and we've got sponsors coming in all the time so that is working pretty well. But if you align that with a team performance you're doing even better.",
      "“Clubs have lots of people who have been there for many years, love the club and they just need a bit of hope, a bit of aspiration and that will galvanise them to work harder and be more motivated. To me, that's what's needed.”",

The ability as a good manager is to manage downwards, do it in the ticket office, the people working the electricity, that sort of thing. If you can show that sort of empathy with all the employees he'll make a great start.”",

      "Man Utd youngster Kobbie Mainoo is making exceptional progress and he's already been likened to Paul Pogba.",
      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",
      "Pogba left on a free transfer to join Juventus in the summer of 2012 after failing to agree a new contract when it might have been advisable to build a team around him.",
      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",
      "His potential is frightening and a new star from Carrington has been born. He could be everything Pogba was supposed to be for United.",

      "United are well aware that positive results are simply a by-product of all the hard work that goes on at the youth level, and the real success of their illustrious academy is that 249 players have emerged from it to make their competitive debuts for the club.",

Head of the Academy, Nick Cox, said he was genuinely intrigued to know who the next would be. It might not be Sam Mather, but he could well be one of the following crop to do so.",

      "What will please his coaches most, though, is that he also knows how to do the simple stuff. If you put yourself in the right areas, you will score a lot of goals. He did just that when he tapped in a third from a matter of yards out after James Scanlon's initial effort had been saved.",
      "He not only had three goals in 15 minutes, but he could quite easily have had five. But if you don't take those chances, you will be punished. Norwich didn't have many but got one back on the stroke of half time when Ken Aboh fired into the bottom corner after a brilliant solo run.",
      "Norwich were much improved after the restart but when a player is in red-hot form, there is little you can do. United worked the ball well on the edge of the box and when it reached Mather at the back post, he cut inside and curled a beautiful effort into the far corner of the net.",
      "The only annoyance is that United's dominance wasn't so obvious by the end. A calamitous defensive mix-up allowed Adian Manning the simplest of tap-ins into an open net and Norwich should have had another when Aboh fired over from a tight angle inside the box.",

      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "\"Through the Institute and its global scientific network, the initiative will provide the club with an added layer of intelligence around the latest developments in performance science within the context of player development.",
      "\"The project will enable the Institute’s experts to work closely with club staff to address multidisciplinary performance challenges, further strengthening ManchesterUnited’s football operations.”",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly looking to build a new stadium for Manchester United; the British billionaire is set to acquire a £1.2bn stake in the club and will put £239m into the club's infrastructure; Ratcliffe wants to build a 'Wembley of the North'",
      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:41, UK",
      "Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators.",
      "The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which moved a step closer after a successful vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday.",
      "\"I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,\" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",
      "\"It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium.\"",
      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",

      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:40, UK",
      "It is not even 20 years ago that Emirates Stadium and Wembley Stadium were best in class for stadium design in the UK and around the world.",
      "While both are still considered excellent venues for hosting top-class football and events, there is no hiding the advancements in stadium design in such a short space of time, with the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, and other new stadiums around the world.",
      "But are brand new stadiums the future?",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. Could those plans include the renovation of Old Trafford?",
      "Last summer, as part of Sky Sports' Future of Football series, with the help of the architects designing and the clubs building the stadiums, we took a look at some of the key developments in stadium design and what could be around the corner in stadiums of the future.",
      "Are Man Utd getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Renovation and refurbishment is certain to play a huge part in stadium design in the future.",
      "We are already seeing that in Spain. The renovation of one of the world's most famous football stadiums is well underway as the Espai Barca project sees Barcelona upgrade the Camp Nou and renovate 18 acres of the area surrounding the stadium.",
      "Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.",
      "Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind.",
      "He said: \"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums.",
      "\"I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.",
      "\"First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,\" he added. \"There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be.",
      "\"You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so.\"",
      "Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event.",
      "Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people.",
      "For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority.",
      "Lee said: \"From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives.",
      "\"From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect.",
      "\"We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings.",
      "\"Every stadium and every location is different,\" he added. \"But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect.",
      "\"If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US.",
      "\"Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes.\"",
      "There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities.",
      "The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community.",
      "An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces.",
      "The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time.",
      "\"When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,\" Lee said. \"They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes.",
      "\"I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities.",
      "\"In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators.",
      "\"A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities.\"",
      "Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities.",
      "He said: \"We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community.",
      "\"We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays.",
      "\"It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities.\"",
      "Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue.",
      "The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as \"the world's first timber stadium.\"",
      "Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",
      "\"The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,\" he said. \"Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else.",
      "\"There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero.",
      "\"The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,\" he added. \"For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles.",
      "\"When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain.",
      "\"It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too.",
      "\"I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\"",
      "For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium.",
      "Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: \"In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability.",
      "\"At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall.",
      "\"We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building.",
      "\"Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud.\"",
      "Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more \"relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community\" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round.",
      "Barbany said: \"There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow.",
      "\"There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona.",
      "\"If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique.",
      "\"Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday.",
      "\"On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend.",
      "\"You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is.",
      "\"This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project.\"",
      "Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:\n\n\n“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.\n“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.\n\n\n“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.\n\n\n“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.”",
      "Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a \"catalyst for the digital transformation of the club\", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution.",
      "With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes.",
      "\"Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there.",
      "\"All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home.\"",
      "We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom.",
      "So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design?",
      "Populous managing director Lee said: \"The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design.",
      "\"None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses.",
      "\"But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience.\"",
      "\"Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world.",
      "\"It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,\" he added.",
      "\"We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game.",
      "\"The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally.",
      "\"Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see.\"",
      "So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years? Virtual and augmented reality is a topic we looked at in further detail in our Future of Football series.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's fierce shot gave Erik ten Hag's team the lead in the first half, on the occasion of the striker's 21st birthday, before two second-half strikes by Garnacho took the game away from West Ham. Kalvin Phillips made another error for the third goal.",
      "West Ham had 20 shots and might have equalised just before Garnacho's first had Emerson Palmieri capitalised on an error by Harry Maguire on the England defender's return to the team. But David Moyes' men were not clinical and their opponents were.",
      "The result sees Manchester United leapfrog West Ham into sixth spot and build on the momentum of their late winner at Wolves on Thursday evening. It is five unbeaten in all competitions now. Momentum might just be building at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (6), Dalot (7), Maguire (5), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (6), Garnacho (8), Hojlund (7), Rashford (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nSubs: McTominay (6), Varane (6), Antony (n/a), Lindelof (n/a).\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Ham: Areola (6), Coufal (6), Johnson (7), Zouma (6), Aguerd (6), Emerson (5), Soucek (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Alvarez (6), Kudus (7), Bowen (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nSubs: Fabianski (6), Phillips (5), Cornet (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "On the weekend that Old Trafford paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6 1958, Manchester United were looking to build on their midweek win over Wolves but Moyes' West Ham side made for testing opponents.",
      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",
      "But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed.",
      "Manchester United have had false dawns before and this was far from a totally dominant display. But, with key players back from injury, two wins in four days have begun to change the complexion of their Premier League season. Upwardly mobile once more?",
      "Ten Hag revealed afterwards the knee injury to Martinez is \"a personal disaster\" for the player. \"I can't say but it doesn't look good,\" said the United boss when speaking in the press conference. \"There is a bad concern. We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis.",
      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "West Ham boss Moyes also said Martinez made \"a huge difference\" for Manchester United. \"He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play. I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable.\"",
      "Moyes even highlighted Martinez's role in a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Maguire. The Argentina international was able to force Emerson wide. \"I think he was a bit spooked by Martinez.\"",

      "Plus: Lack of belief costs West Ham at Man Utd; Nottingham Forest show signs that they can get themselves out of Premier League relegation trouble after draw at Bournemouth",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 13:55, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Sunday 4 February 2024 12:28, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",

      "Report and highlights as Kobbie Mainoo's goal won a seven-goal thriller for Manchester United at Molineux. Pedro Neto had equalised for Wolves in stoppage time. United led by two goals twice with Marcus Rashford scoring on his return to the team",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",
      "Wolves: Sa (5), Kilman (6), Dawson (6), Toti (4), Semedo (6), Doyle (6), Lemina (6), Doherty (4), Bellegarde (5), Neto (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ait-Nouri (7), Sarabia (7), Gomes (n/a), Fraser (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (5), Dalot (6), Varane (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Mainoo (8), Casemiro (6), Garnacho (6), Fernandes (7), Rashford (7), Hojlund (7).\n\n\nSubs: Antony (5), McTominay (7), Maguire (n/a), Evans (n/a), Forson (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",
      "\"You are tested in the Premier League, the emotion of it. We go completely off plan [after Rashford's early goal] and start opening up big spaces. But in terms of the togetherness, the work ethic, I thought second half, we were by far the better side.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Gary Neville:",
      "\"I was a part of those games when you've given a goal away at one end and somehow one of your special players would do something special and the goal was sensational by Mainoo. We've seen different types of goals but for him to keep such composure and put the ball in between someone's legs and the finish!",
      "\"He's a fantastic player. I think to come into Man Utd team in any team is very difficult and he's come into the team in one of the club's most difficult times in recent history and he's just stood out as being someone whose temperament and composure is off the scale.",
      "\"He's got the world at his feet for the next few years and there's been an example where you can get carried away: Marcus Rashford had the same. But he's got 15 years coming up, Mainoo, where he's got to keep feet on the ground. But he's got all the attributes that you would need to be a top player.\"",
      "Manchester United host West Ham on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 2pm.",
      "Wolves travel to Chelsea, also on Sunday; kick-off 2pm."

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",
