      "Manchester United will not pay over the odds for Bryan Mbeumo after Tottenham entered the race for the Brentford forward and have other targets within the Premier League, it has emerged.",
      "The Red Devils have been proactive in trying to strengthen their playing squad off the back of a horrendous 2024-25 campaign, signing Wolves' Matheus Cunha and making an early move for Mbeumo.",
      "Their pursuit of the sought-after Cameroon star, 25, has been complicated by Tottenham, though, with Thomas Frank keen to make Mbeumo his marquee summer signing after swapping Brentford for Tottenham earlier this week.",
      "And while Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United ahead of all others this summer, ESPN report that the club will not exceed a certain price point for the former Troyes man and that they have alternative targets in mind.",
      "Eberechi Eze and Antoine Semenyo have both been linked to United already this summer and would come into the club's thinking if a deal for Mbeumo does evade them.",
      "Eze, the Crystal Palace playmaker, is another player who has no shortage of admirers after punctuating another stellar season at Crystal Palace with a match-winning display in the FA Cup final.",
      "It's understood that Eze has a £68m release clause in his contract at Selhurst Park, putting him in a similar price bracket as Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Semenyo has also had a fine season, registering 11 goals and five assists in the Premier League. Intriguingly, the Ghana international is also of interest to Spurs.",
      "Bournemouth are thought to value Semenyo at around £70m, though they may not need to cash in on another of their top-tier talents with Dean Huijsen already sold and Milos Kerkez and Illya Zabarnyi likely to follow in the coming weeks.",
      "While United have alternative targets in mind, they are expected to try and push through a deal for Mbeumo given the player has made no secret of his desire to make the move.",
      "United ranked among the Premier League's lowest scorers last term with only the bottom three and Everton failing to better their tally of 44 strikes.",

      "Arsenal are said to be readying an offer for Viktor Gyokeres with the Sporting Lisbon striker seemingly not interested in reuniting with Ruben Amorim at Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, has been heavily linked with both the Gunners and United after another fine season in Portugal, where his goals fired Sporting to another league title. And after plenty of talk about a blockbuster transfer, it seems things are finally starting to happen.",
      "Arsenal and United are both in the market for more firepower, with the former understood to be targeting either Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "United are coming off the back of their worst ever Premier League campaign and, with that in mind, Portuguese outlet Record claims Gyokeres' representatives have told the Red Devils he will not be joining them this summer.",
      "And in a double whammy for United the report adds that Arsenal are now 'preparing a second offer' for the striker in a bid to bring him to north London.",
      "It's claimed that Sporting have already rejected an offer from Arsenal in the hope of banking at least €70million (£59.2m) before agreeing to part ways with their star forward.",
      "It remains to be seen if Arsenal do put down a fresh offer for Gyokeres given the recent noise centred around Sesko; the Slovenia striker, like Gyokeres, is expected to move this summer and has no shortage of suitors and Arsenal have held transfer talks.",
      "In Gyokeres' case, he is known to have an £85m release clause in his contract. It was, however, reported that the club would sanction an exit for just £59m this summer.",
      "Frederico Varandas, Sporting's president, has disputed that, though, in the recent days. Speaking in a press conference on Wednesday, hesaid: \"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that.",
      "\"To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "\"Sporting will not demand the release clause, but they should know me better by now: threats, blackmail, insults, they don't work with me,\" he added.",
      "\"I can guarantee one thing: Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m + €10m. He won't leave because I never allowed it, and with this game that the agent is playing, the situation will only get worse.\"",

      "Sir David Beckham's recent knighthood has cemented his status as a national treasure, celebrated for his footballing legacy and global influence. The 50-year-old, alongside his wife Victoria, has built an empire that extends far beyond the pitch, with their combined net worth estimated at £500million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List.",
      "However, their fortune pales in comparison to the staggering wealth of Faiq Bolkiah, the richest footballer on the planet, whose net worth is reported to be around £20billion - roughly 40 times that of the Beckhams. Bolkiah, a 27-year-old winger who, at one point, was in Chelsea's academy, is a member of the Brunei royal family, owing his immense wealth primarily to his lineage as the nephew of the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah.",
      "Unlike Beckham, whose wealth stems from a storied career with Manchester United, Real Madrid, as well as countless lucrative endorsements, Bolkiah's fortune is mostly inherited. The Brunei royal family's vast holdings include oil and gas reserves, luxury properties, and investments that dwarf the earnings of even the most successful athletes.",
      "While Bolkiah's football career has earned him modest wages, his royal status places him in a financial league of his own. In contrast, the Beckhams have meticulously crafted their wealth through football, fashion, and media ventures.",
      "David's playing career, which included 115 caps for England and multiple league titles, laid the foundation. His post-retirement endeavours, including co-owning Inter Miami and securing high-profile sponsorships with brands like Adidas and Haig Club, have significantly boosted their fortune.",
      "Victoria's fashion empire, particularly her eponymous label, has added further millions, with the couple's business acumen evident in their £70m in company assets and £40m in dividends over recent years.",
      "Bolkiah, however, operates in a different realm. His wealth allows for a lifestyle that includes private jets and supercars, making the Beckhams' collection of Bentleys and Range Rovers seem modest by comparison.",
      "While David and Victoria's property empire - which includes a Notting Hill townhouse, a mansion in the Cotswolds and a Miami penthouse - is enviable, Bolkiah's access to palatial residences across Brunei and beyond is unparalleled. Yet, despite his riches, Bolkiah remains relatively low-profile in football, focusing on his career in Thailand and with the Brunei national team rather than chasing global stardom.",
      "He currently plays for Ratchaburi, having joined them from fellow Thai League 1 outfit Chonburi in 2023. Prior to that, he was contracted to Portuguese club Maritimo, but failed to make a senior appearance for the team.",
      "Bolkiah spent the bulk of his youth career in England, firstly with Southampton, then Chelsea and later Leicester. However, he wasn't able to earn a professional contract - despite being an international footballer (he's earned six caps for Brunei) since 2016.",
      "The contrast between Bolkiah and Beckham highlights different paths to wealth in football. While David represent the pinnacle of self-made success, leveraging talent and branding to amass a fortune, Bolkiah embodies a rare intersection of sport and inherited wealth, where football is a passion rather than a financial necessity.",
      "As Sir David basks in the glow of his knighthood, his and Victoria's £500m empire, though impressive, is a mere fraction of Bolkiah's billions, underscoring the extraordinary scale of the Brunei prince's wealth."

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has spoken out about his future amid reports that the Red Devils are eyeing a move for World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez. Onana has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford since joining the club from Inter Milan in 2023.",
      "The 29-year-old has made a series of high-profile errors which have prompted speculation that United could look to offload him and sign a replacement. And when asked about the rumours while attending an event in Burkina Faso, Onana told Afrik-Foot : \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "Onana's comments come after reports from Argentina claimed that Martinez is keen on a move to United. The 32-year-old has been linked with moves to a number of clubs this summer and he recently addressed the rumours while on international duty.",
      "\"My future? I don't know, I come here to play for the national team, and that's the only thing that matters to me right now,\" Martinez said. \"Do I want to move to a new club? The transfer window just opened, so there's still a long way to go.\"",
      "And Bolavip are reporting that United are the 'main option' for the Aston Villa star. The report adds that Turkish club Galatasaray have made contact with Martinez after veteran goalkeeper Fernando Muslera left the club, but the Argentine wants to remain in the Premier League.",
      "It is claimed that Martinez is 'waiting on a call' from United, who are 'holding off' at the moment as they have not managed to sell Onana yet. And Martinez's former coach Neil Cutler, who worked with the goalkeeper at Villa, has backed him to be a success at Old Trafford.",
      "Cutler and Martinez remain close friends and he told the Sun last month: \"This summer is pivotal for Emi in terms of his career. He's been voted the best goalie in the world twice and there seems to be an opportunity for him this summer, with all of his options open.",
      "\"Big clubs are queuing up to speak to him and he either stays at a massive club like Villa or he goes to a truly world-class club. I don't think it's about money with Emi so I don't think he is ready to move to Saudi yet.",
      "\"If he does move it would be to a much bigger club — one of the really big-hitters like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico... or even Manchester United. United can't offer him Champions League football but the sheer size of the club and the size of the challenge might appeal to Emi.",
      "\"Emi has the confidence required to play for a massive club like United and would feel he could affect the club in a really positive way. He would look at United and say: 'Right, I can make this place better. I can help this club get back to where it was'.\"",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has sparked a debate on social media after insisting he was better than a list of superstar players, including Neymar, Sergio Aguero, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Rooney will go down as one of the best players in Premier League history after he blitzed 253 goals in 559 appearances for the Red Devils, helping them win five titles, three League Cups, one FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League.",
      "In his prime, Rooney netted a high of 34 goals in the 2009-10 and 2011-12 seasons under Sir Alex Ferguson, and at one point was linked with an exit and twice demanded to leave the club. He previously revealed Barcelona and Real Madrid were both interested in his signature.",
      "And it's clear Rooney still holds himself in the highest regard as a player after being asked to compare himself with a number of top footballers in a \"winner stays on\" format video on social media by Gamdom.",
      "Rooney was first asked to say who was better between himself or ex-Liverpool and Barcelona forward Luis Suarez, as he admitted: \"Tough one to start,\" before naming himself.",
      "The 39-year-old then ousted Neymar, Aguero and Ibrahimovic before the presenter said Lewandowski's name, which promoted the ex-striker to say: \"These are tough by the way,\" before he still picked himself, and did the same against Erling Haaland.",
      "He also hesitated before picking himself ahead of Harry Kane but had no problems doing the same thing when Alessandro Del Piero was mentioned. Some fans were left flabbergasted that Rooney viewed himself above so many top players - with many stunned that he thought he was better than Neymar.",

      "A third said: \"The lack of self-awareness is crazy,\" as another mocked him for claiming the choices were hard despite naming himself every time.",
      "But a number of fans pointed out that Rooney was right to back his ability over all of the players put to him as a generational talent who won every trophy available to him and wowed from an early age until the end of his career.",
      "One Manchester United fan said: \"I’m sorry but if you’re not rating Wayne Rooney then you must be under 20. Rooney in his day was unplayable widely regarded as one of England's greatest talents and one of the most successful players of he’s generation.\"",
      "A second fan pointed out that many social media users criticising him were clearly of a newer generation who did not watch him growing up, saying: \"Prime Wayne Rooney clears all of these players and it’s not particularly close.\"",
      "A third pointed out that only two players mentioned could compete, saying: \"Other than Neymar and possibly Suarez, rest of his answers were spot on. Rooney was a phenom.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford's dazzling Cameroonian forward, has become one of the most talked-about names of the summer as the transfer window gathers momentum. The 25-year-old has enjoyed a breakout Premier League campaign - showcasing a potent mix of creativity, clinical finishing and tireless energy that's cemented his status as one of the division's standout performers outside the traditional 'big six.'",
      "Since arriving from Troyes in 2019, Mbeumo has been a quietly consistent presence for the Bees. But in 2024/25, he's shifted gears - racking up an impressive 20 goals and nine assists across 42 appearances. With numbers like those, it was only a matter of time before top clubs came calling. Now, they are.",
      "With Manchester United and Tottenham locked in a fierce tug-of-war for his signature, speculation over his future is reaching fever pitch. Mbeumo offers both clubs a unique mix of flair and versatility, but where will he end up?",
      "The Red Devils thought they had Mbeumo in the bag. Reports suggested the Cameroon international was keen on a move to Old Trafford, and with Matheus Cunha already secured, United felt they had the luxury of time to finalise the rest of their summer business - or so they thought.",
      "Their opening bid of £50m (£40m plus £10m in add-ons) was promptly rejected by Brentford. A few days later, United returned with an improved offer of £55m (£45m plus £10m in add-ons), but the Bees remained firm, valuing their star man closer to £70m.",
      "While United hesitated, Tottenham seized their chance. They swooped in with a superior offer - reportedly £65m plus £5m in add-ons - and instantly changed the complexion of the race. Their ace in the hole? Newly appointed manager Frank, who helped nurture Mbeumo into a Premier League gem in West London.",
      "That existing relationship could prove decisive, and now, what once looked like a straightforward deal for United is teetering. Tottenham have emerged as serious rivals for his signature - and suddenly, it's they who look to have the momentum in the situation.",
      "Just days ago, Mbeumo seemed destined for United. It's understood he'd 'given priority' to the Manchester club, reportedly over other English suitors such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle. The Red Devils' project, despite no European football next season, appealed to Mbeumo, who was sold not only on Ruben Amorim's vision after talks in May, but also by the prospect of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "Despite their rejected bids, United were expected to strike an agreement with Brentford sooner or later. But Frank's arrival at Tottenham has flipped the script. Reports indicate that while Mbeumo's first choice remains United, he's increasingly leaning toward a move to Spurs, swayed by the chance to reunite with the manager who knows him best.",
      "Tottenham's willingness to meet Brentford's valuation, coupled with Frank's promise of a starring role in their Champions League campaign, has Mbeumo rethinking his future. While United aren't out of the race yet, Spurs' aggressive push has put them in a commanding position, leaving fans on both sides chewing their nails.",
      "Amid the transfer whirlwind, Mbeumo has stayed tight-lipped - until now. The Brentford star recently took to Instagram to address the elephant in the room: Frank's departure to Tottenham.",
      "After the move was confirmed, he uploaded a post with multiple photos of him and Frank together, captioning it with two prayer emojis. The post, while dripping with gratitude, sent fans into a frenzy, with many reading it as a subtle nod to his hopes of a potential Spurs switch.",
      "However, Mbeumo's social media activity doesn't explicitly commit to any club, keeping the saga deliciously open-ended.",
      "If Mbeumo's online signals are enigmatic, his impact on the pitch is anything but. It's no surprise, then, that both United and Tottenham are pushing hard - ready to splash significant cash to secure Mbeumo's signature.",
      "Where things begin to diverge, however, is on the wage front. United are reportedly prepared to offer a package worth around £160,000 per week. Tottenham, on the other hand, are offering closer to £130,000 per week - still substantial, but a figure that would push the upper limits of their current wage structure.",
      "As negotiations intensify, the forward's next destination remains one of the summer's most captivating subplots. Whether it's under the bright lights of Old Trafford or alongside familiar faces in North London, one thing is clear: wherever Mbeumo lands, he has every chance of becoming a major success.",
      "A player in his prime, with momentum at his back and suitors at his feet, ready to light up an elite stage. The only question left is: who gets to call him theirs?"

      "Manchester United will welcome Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon at the start of July after previously landing his signature in a £7million deal. The new arrival has drawn comparisons to Wayne Rooney given his impact at such a young age.",
      "The Red Devils have gone after some household names this summer but it is the lesser known individual who has been tipped to have a major impact. United paid an initial £3.3m but allowed the teenager to remain at Cerro Porteno.",
      "Playing in the Paraguayan top flight meant he was able to land regular minutes and he will hope to feature in Ruben Amorim's plans, but will have to usurp several household names in the pecking order if he wants to be considered first choice.",
      "Paraguayan football expert Ralph Hannah, co-host of the podcast Guaraní Vision, told the MEN that Leon reminds him of a teenage Rooney, who would go on to become the club's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He said: \"So far he has always played in a back four as an attacking left back, but his athleticism would suggest he would have the legs for wing back. His U17s coach Badayco Maciel told me he could play left wing. The main question marks will be tactically if he could adapt quick enough.",
      "\"For United fans his shaved head and hunched shoulders that make his seem much older than he is and are reminiscent of a teenage Rooney.\"",
      "United have previously benefitted from going after teenage talent, only to see them blossom. Alejandro Garnacho arrived from Atletico Madrid for an initial £150,000 in 2020 and has since become a first-team member and would command a hefty fee if he were to leave, which remains a possibility this summer.",
      "Amorim has wasted no time in bolstering his ranks this summer. Matheus Cunha has signed from Wolves for just over £60m, owing to a release clause in his contract. More firepower is a priority with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Bryan Mbeumo being linked.",
      "United missed out on the signing of Liam Delap, who opted to join Chelsea rather than heading to Manchester. The club's dire season though emphasised the need for improvement in a majority of areas as Amorim sets about his recruitment.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Viktor Gyokeres has REJECTED a move to Manchester United, reports in Portugal have claimed. The Swedish striker had been linked with a switch to Old Trafford to reunite him with former Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "But as per Record, Gyokeres has turned down the chance to become a Red Devil, with his agents informing United chiefs. Arsenal now appear to be in the lead for his services as they too pursue his signature.",
      "Gyokeres' decision comes after the striker broke his silence on the ongoing saga when it comes to his future. It was previously reported that Sporting had turned down a £55m bid for his signature from Arsenal.",
      "That apparently triggered anger from the former Coventry man, who was seemingly led to believe his current employers would allow him to leave for a modest fee only to up their demands.",
      "And that led Gyokeres to threaten strike action to force through a move away. Taking to Instagram, Gyokeres wrote: He said: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sporting Lisbon president Frederico Varandas also offered his take on the striker's future and claimed that the club would not be bullied into a sale this summer. Speaking to Record, he said: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "\"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season,\" Varandas added.",
      "\"During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him. When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.\"",
      "Arsenal will now continue talks with Sporting regarding a deal but if negotiations do not prove to be productive, they could ask for around £84m for Gyokeres' services. The 27-year-old still has three years left to run on his deal with the Portuguese giants.",

      "Rio Ferdinand believes that Ruben Amorim has until Christmas to impress at Manchester United before the board assess his future. The Portuguese tactician has struggled since arriving at Old Trafford in November in the wake of Erik ten Hag's dismissal, failing to mould his inherited squad to suit his patented style of play.",
      "As a result, the Red Devils finished 15th and failed to achieve any domestic or European silverware. Despite it coming as United's lowest-ever finish in the Premier League, it appears as though the board are willing to back the 40-year-old this summer and see how he performs with a full transfer window and pre-season to make adjustments.",
      "\"He's had one player, [Patrick] Dorgu, that he's been able to recruit. So, it looks like [Matheus] Cunha’s come, and I think there's hopefully going to be one or two more in this window.",
      "\"Then you can start judging him a little bit more. I don't think in his wildest dreams he thought he'd have finished 15th. None of us fans would have thought that either.",
      "\"So, that's been a huge disappointment in that sense. But I don't think you can fully judge everything he's done yet when he hasn't had a chance to bring in players. We're judging him based on someone else's players. And I think, yeah, get to Christmas and let's see how we're looking.\"",
      "After Ten Hag spent big on the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro over the summer, Amorim had little room to work with in January. As a result United brought in just two players in the form of Dorgu from Lecce for £25.1million and Ayden Heaven from Arsenal in a deal reported to be worth a little more than £1m.",
      "However, the Red Devils have hit the ground running in the early summer transfer window, signing Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal as they look to bolster their strike force. They have also been linked with Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Bryan Mbeumo, although it is thought that the latter may follow Thomas Frank to Tottenham after his own departure from Brentford.",
      "Numerous names have tried to replicate the glory days of Sir Alex Ferguson at United since his retirement in 2013, including David Moyes, Louis Van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, only to come up short. And Ferdinand also noted that there could be numerous reasons as to why the club hasn't won a Premier League title in over a decade.",
      "He explained: \"If I had the answer to that question, I'd be at Man Utd now sorting things out. But I don't think it's ever one reason. I don't think when you have failures in anything, in any walk of life, it's down to one single thing.",
      "\"I think there's a number of different things that you could point to for the demise of Manchester United and sustained lack of success. I think one of them being the recruitment will be high on the list of most people, saying that the recruitment's been wrong.",
      "\"For whatever reason, for various different reasons, identifying the wrong players technically, tactically, physically, mentally at times, that's been an issue. Were the managers right for the club at the respective times that they came? Maybe not, some of them.",
      "\"And I think the actual infrastructure of the football club behind the scenes has been probably something that you looked at and gone, actually, that could have been better. And there was a big change.",
      "\"Not many clubs lose their manager, the most successful manager they've ever had, and the CEO in the same window. But Man Utd had done that, and they had two people that were pivotal to the success. One was a lot more public and was understood to be the driver of the whole machine, which he was to a certain point.",
      "\"But every great manager, every great individual, there's always a sidekick somewhere, and David Gill was that for Sir Alex Ferguson. So, to lose two of them when United did was definitely a hammer blow, but never recovered since.\"",
      "It comes as Ferdinand launched his Career Transfer Hub with Talking Futures, in a bid to connect teenagers with their parents in making choices and planning their futures. On the campaign, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has forged a career as a successful businessman after hanging up his boots at Old Trafford. Neville, 50, dramatically called time on his football career in February 2011, walking away in the middle of the 2010-11 campaign.",
      "He left the sport after clinching two Champions League titles, eight Premier Leagues, four FA Cups and three League Cups. Now, he's set to return to the Old Trafford pitch for Soccer Aid this Sunday.",
      "His business acumen has proven as sharp as his defending, as evidenced by his colossal net worth. Finance Monthly estimates Neville's net worth to be between £70-£100million, despite a significant financial setback reported in 2022.",
      "Financial records for 'Hotel Football', which is located opposite Old Trafford and co-owned by Neville along with Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, revealed losses of £3.2m over 2020 and 2021. The company also received a loan of £10.2m from parent company 'Orchid Leisure' during that period.",
      "In October 2024, City AM reported the hotel lost £630,158 in 2022 and £601,030 in 2023. However, there were signs of recovery as the hotel's turnover increased from £6.4m to £7.8m during that time. Despite its losses, it still carries a valuation of around £20-£30m, according to FM.",
      "In addition to Hotel Football, he also owns the Stock Exchange Hotel in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester. This was entirely hired out by Madonna in 2023 when she performed in the city. Despite experiencing losses over the years, FM estimates its value at around £15-£20m.",
      "The former England star might not be pleased with the losses, but his extensive business empire provides ample cushioning. Companies House records show that Neville's hotel business has approximately £20m in assets. His property development company is also believed to hold assets worth £10.5m.",
      "When all of his other businesses are taken into account, it's reported that he has combined assets of £40m. Among these is his production company Buzz 16, which produces sports content including 'The Overlap' on YouTube, home to his popular podcast 'Stick to Football'.",
      "Like many investors, Neville has also ventured into the real estate industry as another income source. He owns a luxury home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, which has undergone significant renovations since he purchased it in the early 2000s.",
      "The venture includes a nine-floor office, a rooftop restaurant and two food and drink outlets on the ground floor. A towering 41-storey building will also be part of the project, housing a 162-bed five-star hotel, 75,000 square feet of office space and 217 apartments.",
      "Neville is also one of the owners of League Two side Salford City. The club recently announced a new ownership group, led by Neville, David Beckham, US businessman Declan Kelly and Lord Mervyn Davies.",
      "He first bought the club in 2014 alongside Class of 92 team-mates Phil Neville, Giggs, Scholes and Butt, who held a combined 50% of the club, while Singaporean businessman Peter Lim held the rest. However, the new takeover means Lim and his ex-United colleagues are no longer shareholders. The latter quartet will reportedly maintain some roles they had at the club, going into the new era.",

      "The former England captain, who won 115 caps for the Three Lions, with 59 of those as captain, has become one of the most recognisable faces on the planet since breaking through as a teenager at Old Trafford, as part of the fabled 'Class of 92'.",
      "Beckham would make his United debut in September 1992, before signing his first professional contract on January 23 1993. He would win six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, two Charity Shields, the Intercontinental Cup and the Champions League during his time at the club, a part of the club's historic Treble winners in 1999.",
      "A United statement on social media said simply: \"Sir David Beckham. Massive congratulations from everyone at United on this special achievement Becks - you truly deserve this.\"",
      "Beckham himself labelled it a \"truly humbling honour\".",
      "In a statement, Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true.",

      "He spent four years with the Spanish giants - forcing United to sell him to the Bernabeu despite the club trying to sort a deal with the Madrid club's bitter rivals Barcelona - before joining LA Galaxy in MLS.

      "David Beckham declared himself \"immensely proud\" after being bestowed with a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. Beckham, who turned 50 last month, has been given the honour for his services to sport and charity.",
      "The former England captain, who won 115 caps for the Three Lions, with 59 of those as captain and Manchester United icon has become one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, known as well in Los Angeles as he is in Auckland and pretty much everywhere in between.",

      "It has been a rollercoaster ride for Beckham, who used to earn £10 a shift collecting glasses at Walthamstow dog track before heading to United's academy as part of the fabled 'Class of 92', where, after making his Premier League debut in 1994, he truly announced himself as a star on the opening day of the 1996-97 season, with a memorable goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.",
      "The red card at France '98 and the subsequent fallout has never been forgotten - least of all by himself. In a Netflix documentary series, released during October 2023, Beckham revealed he still cannot forgive himself for the abuse his family suffered amid the fallout, which include a pub hanging up an effigy of Beckham, and the hostility he faced at grounds around the country the following season. He admitted it left him a \"mess\".",
      "And yet, he not only went on to be an integral part of United's Treble success in 1999 - winning six Premier League titles and two FA Cups too during his time at Old Trafford - he became England captain just two years after his dismissal in Saint-Etienne, became a one-man wrecking crew to drag the national side kicking and screaming to the 2002 World Cup with a virtuoso display and 93rd minute equaliser against Greece - and there, in Japan and South Korea, completed his redemption story with the winner against Argentina during the group stage.",
      "At the height of his footballing fame, fronting global brands and married to a pop star, he became a Galactico in 2003, joining Real Madrid in a £25million move after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and refusing to join Barcelona, having made almost 400 appearances for United and scoring 85 goals.",
      "Beckham would go on to win La Liga before he departed for LA Galaxy in 2007 and collected the MLS Cup twice, spending two loan stints at AC Milan along the way. In January 2013, Beckham returned to Europe with Paris Saint Germain, later announcing his decision to retire when he signed off with a Ligue 1 winners’ medal.",
      "During his time in the States he had already been thinking about life after football, a remarkable business move during his time in MLS allowing him to become co-owner of Inter Miami in 2020 at a cut price rate, while a multi-million-pound lifetime deal with Adidas, signed in 2003, had long since secured his financial future away from the game.",
      "Beckham, who was made an OBE for services to football in 2003, has long been involved with children’s charity UNICEF, and is a co-owner of film production company Studio 99.",
      "In 2024 he was appointed Ambassador for The King’s Foundation which works globally to create sustainable communities through placemaking projects and also transform lives through practical education programmes.",

      "The situation surrounding Viktor Gyokeres is really starting to spiral as he pushes to leave Sporting Lisbon. Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games in all competitions for Sporting this season, but is now keen to move on and test himself in the Premier League.",
      "The Sweden international snubbed a move to Saudi Arabia and Al Hilal this week, which would’ve earned him in the region of £500k-per-week. Both Manchester United - where former mentor Ruben Amorim - and Arsenal are pursuing a new No.9 this summer, and Gyokeres is keen to join either.",
      "As he does so, the fallout in Portugal is getting increasingly bitter. It has been claimed that Gyokeres is willing to go on strike to force a move away from Sporting after suggestions they’ve been increasing their asking price in talks with potential buyers, having, it’s claimed by the Gyokeres camp, to sell him for a set fee.",
      "To that end, Gyokeres has an £85million release clause in his contract, but his representatives have claimed a deal worth a total £59m had been agreed with Sporting chiefs and that that was what they are expecting him to be sold for this summer.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas hit out in response, insisting he would not be bullied into selling his club’s prized asset: \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres himself followed that up on social media, declaring: “There is a lot of talk at the moment, most of it is false. I will speak when the time is right.”",
      "Now, Gyokeres' agent, Hakan Cetinkaya, had appeared to come out - according to Swedish media - and claim that he has written proof of the £59m agreement. Except he didn’t say it. Gyokeres representative didn’t make the comment, as first reported by Record.",
      "Which leaves the whole situation just looking increasingly messy. And for the two Premier League clubs who may be interested - United are prioritising Bryan Mbeumo before moving onto a No.9 while Arsenal are understood to prefer Benjamin Sesko over Gyokeres - it's looking increasingly expensive too.",

      "A long-time Newcastle United target, the Brentford forward, fresh from a 20-goal season in the top flight, won't be heading to St James' Park. According to those close to Newcastle, it's because they baulked at the Bees' transfer demands, but more particularly the Cameroon international's salary demands. Those close to the player claim he wasn't interested in a move to the North East.",
      "Instead, the No.1 choice has been Manchester United, who have made him their top target after tying up a deal for Wolves star Matheus Cunha. Offers have been made, but United have fallen short of Brentford's demands, a first offer of £45million up front with £10m in add-ons rejected, before a second bid was also turned down.",
      "Spurs have launched a £70m bid, worth £65m plus £5m in add-ons. All told, it's £10m more than United's last offer, with more guaranteed.",
      "It's understood Mbeumo still prefers to join United. Certainly they have the edge when it comes to wages, as the salary on offer at Old Trafford is between £150,000-£175,000-a-week with bonuses taking Mbeumo’s expected package to £200,000-a-week.",
      "Spurs would have to break their strict wage structure to match that, with Mbeumo expected to earn around £130,000-£140,000-a-week. Bonuses would still see it fall short of the cash he would pick up at United.",
      "But as Spurs were making their move on Friday afternoon - and before it hit the public domain - Mbeumo himself stoked the transfer rumour flame on social media, amid suggestions he's reconsidering his options. Until then, Mbeumo hadn't reacted to Frank's departure as Brentford boss, but the 25-year-old duly used his Instagram account to do just that, sharing Brentford's post confirming Frank's exit - almost 24 hours later - captioning it with two prayer emojis.",
      "Let's just say it's open to interpretation what they meant. Thank you? Please take me with you? Ultimately the proof will be in the pudding.",
      "Intriguingly, Frank was candid about his desire to continue working with Mbeumo while still Brentford boss, comments that speak volumes about his thoughts of the player.",
      "\"I'm the head coach. I want my best players to stay forever\" he said. \"I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he's thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don't know.",
      "\"I've said many times, we are a selling club. But at the same time, we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world that aren't selling clubs. So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it.",
      "\"But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",

      "“It is the most common phrase that you can say at this moment, but this is the dream come true,” he told MUTV. “Maybe outside, I think maybe my decision, they don’t understand. But when you have always dreamed to play here, it’s easier to pick this decision.",

      "As things stand, it is unlikely United will pay more for Mbeumo than the £60million package they have already splashed out for their marquee signing, Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha.",

United scored 13 goals fewer last season than they managed in 2023/24, recording a -10 goal difference as they finished 15th in the table, having looked set to finish just one place above the relegation zone at one point.",

      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "The Brazilian international officially joined United earlier this week and after scoring 17 goals for Wolves last season he should add some much needed firepower to the club's ranks.",
      "Cunha will slot into one of the attacking midfield roles in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and United are hopeful Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will also arrive to play alongside him.",

      "But it is perhaps a summer signing that was agreed back in January that could prove to be one of the biggest steals of this window.",
      "United announced the signing of Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon for an initial £3.3million that could rise to £7million in add-ons and he will officially join the club on July 1.",
      "In that time, the 18-year-old has continued to play regularly for Cerro Porteno in the Paraguayan top flight, picking up invaluable experience of first team football.",
      "There is a lot of excitement about his ceiling back in his homeland and it has perhaps gone under the radar that he will eventually make the move to Old Trafford in just 16 days' time.",

      "£85",
      "Nobody is expecting him to match the heights of United's record goalscorer, not least because they play in different positions, but the parallels between Leon's impact on senior football at such a tender age and his look and stature with Rooney's meteoric rise at Everton are there for all to see.",
      "Leon plays as a left-wing-back and he will, of course, have to force his way past Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass in the pecking order.",
      "It is more likely he will play with the under-21s to begin with but Amorim has shown he is not afraid to throw in youngsters when they are ready, handing debuts to teenagers Amass, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven this season.",
      "If Leon can deliver on his promise it will be the first success story of Ineos prioritising the signing of young players with high potential and low transfer fees.",
      "And that prospect should excite United fans."

      "For all the poor decisions and mismanagement at Manchester United, perhaps one of the club's biggest problems is something they can do very little about.",
      "Countless players have arrived at Old Trafford and been swallowed up by the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs. And when said players ultimately leave United and thrive elsewhere, little consideration is given to the fact their upturn in form may well be down to the reduced pressure levels at clubs where the spotlight isn't quite so intense.",
      "Of course, United might not be able to do anything about the pressure that comes with representing the club, but they can ensure the players they sign are ready to cope with the demands that come with pulling on that famous red shirt.",
      "In Matheus Cunha, they have signed a player who is all too used to being under the spotlight.",
      "While Wolves may not be the biggest team in England, two-and-a-half years spent in the Premier League after a stint in La Liga with Atletico Madrid along with 15 caps for Brazil mean he is ready for what's about to come his way.",
      "\"I'm so free for that (the pressure that comes with playing for United), honestly. I think I'm grateful to be part of the biggest national team in the world, the pressure there is also huge,\" he told MUTV. \"And I learned a lot. I learned a lot, I think in the beginning it was a little bit different in parts for me.",
      "\"To be honest, sometimes I don't think I managed well and I think I learned from the mistakes. I don't think it's mistakes, it's normal, it's learning. To come here now is the best moment in my life to also feel open for these kind of details.\"",
      "The final part of that answer is also telling. One of the reservations some fans have had over Cunha is his disciplinary record. He was suspended for a combined six matches last season following a full-time scuffle with an Ipswich Town security guard and a red card at Bournemouth. He admits he's learnt a lot in his career so far and is ready for the challenge.",
      "At 26, Cunha is coming into his prime and his 15 Premier League goals last season suggest United have got themselves a real quality player.",
      "With experience of playing in the Premier League, experience of playing in some of Europe's other top leagues and a relatively modest fee of £62.5m for a player who should fit seamlessly into Ruben Amorim's system, it really does feel like the only thing that could get in Cunha's way is the pressure of playing for United.",
      "He wouldn't be the first player to crumble but he's confident that he won't."

      "Manchester United have been one of the most active teams in the summer transfer window despite making just one signing. Following their worst season in 51 years, United have multiple issues to fix before the 2025/26 campaign kicks-off in two months.",
      "Matheus Cunha arrived from Wolves after his £62.5million release clause was triggered, bolstering Ruben Amorim's attacking midfielder options. The Brazilian is expected to play in one of the two positions behind the centre-forward after scoring 17 goals and assisting six last season.",
      "However, United have actively been pursuing moves elsewhere and have prioritised Bryan Mbeumo in the last two weeks. After failing with a first bid for the Brentford star, they now face stiff competition from Tottenham.",

      "One of Gyokeres or Osimhen have both been strongly tipped to come in but complications have left United with neither. The list of attackers linked with a move to Old Trafford is growing by the day but there are two players who could have come in to fill two key positions.",
      "Xavi Simons is similar to Cunha in the way he can fit perfectly behind the striker. The RB Leipzig star is reportedly available for around £67.3m and has the likes of Chelsea keeping tabs on his situation in Germany.",
      "Mbeumo's saga with Spurs is something United do not want to entertain and missing out on the Cameroon international would leave them scrambling for alternatives.",
      "The other is Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Crystal Palace striker has been on United's radar since the end of the season and countless reports have claimed they have opened talks over a possible move.",
      "United wanted to sign Liam Delap, mainly due to his £30m release clause. Mateta, who outscored Delap last term, is said to cost around £40m. Unlike Osimhen and Gyokeres, the Frenchman comes with Premier League experience.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, a new goalkeeper has been tipped to come in to replace Andre Onana. It's believed that Amorim isn't sold on the current goalkeeper and a statement signing in that position could be the difference between Champions League and nothing.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain and Gianluigi Donnarumma are yet to agree on a new contract sparking concerns over his future at the Champions League winners. ESPN have claimed that United have enquired to his agent Enzo Raiola over a potential move to replace Onana.",
      "At only 26, the Italy international has been around for years and is one of the best goalkeepers in Europe. Emiliano Martinez, another elite goalkeeper, is also a player who seems to be available.",
      "The final signings would have been the missing piece to United's jigsaw and unfortunately, they are now Manchester City players. Rayan Cherki and Rayan Ait-Nouri both signed for United's city rivals ahead of the Club World Cup having been on Amorim's radar.",
      "Cherki impressed against United in Europa League while Ait-Nouri's attacking wing-back ability would transform the 3-4-3 implemented at Old Trafford.",
      "Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have all left the club upon the expiry of their contracts. For all associated with United, the hope is that many more will follow them once the second transfer window opens.",
      "Using a mixture of reports and what we have seen, five or six players will leave United. The priority is selling the players returning from their loan spells - Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho - but there are players part of Amorim's current squad that have attracted interest.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's future is unclear and after failing to score the goals needed, is tipped to return to Italy. United's pursuit for a new centre-forward, or two, means cashing-in as much money as possible for the Denmark international could be sturdy business.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho's ongoing saga is a worrying sign. After seemingly conceding his time at Old Trafford is over at the end of the season, two weeks have passed and there doesn't seem to be any movement. In an alternative universe, United would have received a much-welcomed fee for the winger by now."

      "Mbeumo has worked with Frank at Brentford for six years now and he has aided his development from a Ligue 2 footballer to consistent performer in the Premier League. In fact, the 25-year-old produced his best-ever season in 2024/2025, finding the net 20 times in 42 matches.",

      "Osimhen, 26, first spoke to United at the start of May regarding the conditions of a potential move to Old Trafford. After a quiet couple of weeks, talks have since resumed under the same circumstances, with a salary of £10.2million per year and a fee of £63.7m including bonuses for Napoli.",
      "While a deal hasn't been finalised, the report continues to suggest that United are going to push to get a deal over the line for Osimhen, as the Reds look to sign a centre forward.",
      "Transfer interest from Arsenal and Manchester United convinced Victor Osimhen to snub a move to Al-Hilal, according to Tuttosport. Osimhen had been targeted as a marquee signing for Al-Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup and a £63million deal had been agreed between the Saudi Pro League side and Napoli.",
      "There was a confidence that a deal could finalised before June 10 - the first summer transfer window deadline - to ensure he can feature in their three group stage matches at FIFA's revamped tournament.",
      "However, the Nigerian rejected the chance to join Simone Inzaghi's Al-Hilal because he's aware of interest from Arsenal and Manchester United, with both chasing a new No.9 this summer.",
      "According to Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport, Manchester United are ready to approach Napoli with a proposed player swap deal when the window reopens again on June 16. It's claimed that United are 'considering' including Joshua Zirkzee in a 'package deal.'",
      "The report reveals that Osimhen is \"dreaming\" of a proposed move to Old Trafford. Osimhen's reported fee of £63.7m has complicated United's pursuit, especially after missing out on Champions League qualification - prompting the club to explore alternative ways to structure a deal.",
      "Previously discussing the possibility of playing in England, Osimhen told The Independent: \"Of course, one day I’d like to play for a big club in England. I've spoken to Odion [Ighalo] about it.",
      "\"He gave me very good advice, he’s a legend and a big brother. My goal is to play at one of the biggest clubs in the world but now I’m very happy in Lille. My priority is to play a lot of games. Signing for a big club and being on the bench is not exciting for me.\"",
      "Speaking about his future in February, Osimhen said: \"I don't know [about the future], to be honest. A few months ago, nobody ever thought I would come to Galatasaray, despite how big of a club they are.",
      "\"I live for the moment. For what's going to happen in the summer, I don't know, but I want everyone to understand something: I really love this club so much. I love the fans, I love everyone associated with this club, from the president down to the coaching staff.\""

      "However, negotiations remained ongoing and United felt they had received enough reassurance from Mbeumo that Old Trafford was his preferred destination. The Sky report claims that Tottenham's interest remains in its infancy, with initial enquiries having been made about the forward's availability.",
      "Should United now miss out on Mbeumo, the start to their transfer window suddenly becomes a little more bleak as this would be the second high profile target they have missed out. Liam Delap was seen as a priority for the Reds at the beginning of the summer but he would eventually choose to join Chelsea instead."

Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.

What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million.",

      "Does Viktor Gyokeres have a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Sporting? Does his agent have proof of said agreement? Does that same agent have a ‘sales mandate’ for rejected bids? Have Arsenal made an offer? Two offers? Are Manchester United in the running? We’ve attempted to unpick fact from fiction…",
      "Here’s what we do know: Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting since his €20m plus €4m in add-ons (which we strongly suspect have been reached) move from Coventry in the summer of 2023. He now wants to leave. Arsenal and Manchester United are interested. He has a €100m [£84m] release clause in his contract.",
      "From there it all gets a bit murky.",
      "It’s been widely reported that Gyokeres has a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Sporting that he could leave the club this summer for €70m [£59m], but that’s since been refuted by the Portuguese club.",
      "It’s been claimed they actually want €80m [£67m], with that supposed U-turn infuriating Gyokeres to the point of threatening a strike on the back of multiple Swedish outlets claiming his agent Hasan Cetinkaya has ‘written evidence that Sporting promised him to let the player out for €60 million and another €10 million for goals’.",
      "In response, Sporting Lisbon President Frederico Varandas said: “Threats, blackmail and insults don’t work with me.",
      "“I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that.",
      "“This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyokeres, neither today nor last season.”",
      "Gyokeres took to Instagram on Thursday to shed some light on the situation: ‘There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it false. I will speak when the time is right.’",
      "As it turns out, according to Portuguese outlet Record, one of the false claims was his agent’s reported proof of the gentleman’s agreement. He doesn’t have the evidence and never said he did, but Varandas fell hook, line and sinker like the rest of us.",
      "“It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27,’ added Varandas. “Then, we knew Viktor’s dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "“We guaranteed that we would not demand 100 million. In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of 60 million, 70 million… And I said ‘there’s no point in setting a value’ because I don’t know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season… There’s no point in setting a value, I don’t know if it will be 40, 60 or 80. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million.",
      "“From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. 10 months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word.”",
      "MORE VIKTOR GYOKERES COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Liverpool striker targets ranked: Brighton man third, Arsenal and Man Utd target top\n👉 Where Gyokeres ‘thinks he will play next season’ after Arsenal bid and Man Utd interest\n👉 Arsenal legend tells Gunners to land ‘quick and strong’ striker over Gyokeres as title claim made",
      "Now to the offers. Manchester United are said to be ready to make a bid worth €60m plus €10m in add-ons, which Sporting chief Varandas has already told everyone won’t be enough.",
      "What’s more, Record are now claiming that ‘the footballer’s agents have officially told Ruben Amorim’s club that he is no longer an option for the striker’. They end by saying that the door to Old Trafford is ‘definitively’ closed and that ‘the dream destination is really the Emirates’.",
      "But that door to Arsenal looks to be ajar at best with Fabrizio Romano claiming RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘clear favourite’.",
      "Pinches of salt are therefore required over reports claiming the Gunners have made one bid of ‘around €55m’ as a fixed fee for Gyokeres plus bonuses which could take the transfer up to €65m (again, not enough) and that they are preparing a second bid that will ‘exceed €70m’ in total.",
      "And it’s no wonder Sporting want to ramp up the asking price if, as A BOLA claim, Cetinkaya is due 10 per cent of any rejected proposal which exceeds €60m thanks to a particularly cunning ‘sales mandate’ the agent ensured was part of his contract.",
      "We assume that clause can only be triggered once, and not for every rejected proposal over that amount, but the report suggests if the agent does decide to take up the option (and why wouldn’t he?) then ‘Sporting will demand the full value of the player’s termination clause, that is, the €100 million euros’.",
      "There we are then, an entirely successful unpicking of a transfer saga which is only just getting started.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly ‘closed the door’ on a transfer to Manchester United and is keen to complete a ‘dream’ move to Arsenal.",

      "Here’s a look at the most expensive players in Premier League history and whether they sank or swam at their new clubs.",
      "10. Josko Gvardiol – £78 million\nThe £77m paid out by Manchester City for Josko Gvardiol made him the second most expensive defender in the world but already the Croatian has gone some way to proving he was worth the money.",
      "In a season of underwhelming performances, Gvardiol was a rare bright spark and was even playing out of position at left back.",

      "City look to be in the market for a left-back, meaning Gvardiol should be able to move into his more comfortable centre-half position next season.",
      "Verdict: Hit",
      "9. Harry Maguire – £80 million\nIn United’s ‘banter era’, Maguire has become the unwitting face but look beyond the memes and the defender has been a rare consistent performer at Old Trafford.",
      "Joining in 2019, he has made 247 appearances for the club and as managers have come and gone, he still remained in the side.",

      "Verdict: Hit",
      "8. Antony – £86 million\nSpeaking of…",
      "Manchester United’s signing of Antony has turned out so poorly that almost everyone involved is trying to claim it was not their idea.",
      "After a good but not spectacular season at Ajax in 2021-22, United opted to fork out up to £86m for the Brazilian but the wheels soon began to fall off.",
      "It started promisingly with a goal against Arsenal in his debut but his scoring soon dried up. The Brazilian ended his first year with eight goals in 44 appearances.",
      "Forever remembered for a roulette spin that went nowhere, Antony scored just one league goal in his second season at Old Trafford and after making only eight appearances in the 2024-25 Premier League season, he was shipped out on loan to Real Betis.",
      "It was in Spain where Antony recovered his form, earning a nomination for La Liga Player of the Month and helping Betis reach the Conference League final as he became the latest United player to flourish away from Old Trafford.",
      "His Betis performances were a small consolation for United who may be able to claw back some of his transfer fee but regardless of where he goes, the Old Trafford side are certain for a big loss.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "",
      "7. Mykhailo Mudryk – £89 million\nIf the logic behind United’s move for Antony seems shaky, the thought process Chelsea followed to sign Mudryk now seems outright absurd.",
      "After the war in Ukraine suspended football in the region, Mudryk made played 19 times in the 2021-22 season but his performances convinced Chelsea to part with £89m to bring him to Stamford Bridge in a move that represents peak Boehly transfer strategy.",
      "Since then, Mudryk has struggled to break into the team, playing 15 league games in his first season without scoring. He did at least play 41 times in the 2023-24 campaign, ending it with just 11 goal involvements.",
      "As a result, Chelsea looked to strengthen in that position, pushing Mudryk to the bench before he was hit with a provisional suspension for failing a doping test. But even as he waits for the result of the second test, Chelsea’s view on him was made clear when they gave his number 10 shirt to Cole Palmer.",

      "Aside from pushing Graeme Souness to an early grave, Pogba’s very brief moments of brilliance only made his time at Old Trafford even more exasperating as for every game he was good in, he would spend 10 as a passenger.",
      "Eventually, United cut their losses – allowing his contract to expire and Pogba moved back to Juventus again.",
      "In February 2024, Pogab was hit with a four-year ban for doping but it was reduced on appeal. Now able to play again, the Frenchman has been unable to find a club as of yet.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "5. Romelu Lukaku – £97million\nIf the other names on this list disappointed on the pitch, at least they did not take to the media to openly criticise the club and beg for a move away.",
      "Lukaku returned to Chelsea in 2021 on the back of an incredible season with Inter but the Belgian soon found himself a square peg in a round hole given Thomas Tuchel’s system.",

      "Verdict: Miss",
      "4. Jack Grealish – £100million\nBefore heading to the Etihad, Grealish was one of the most reactive and expressive players in the league but he would not be the first, or last, to find himself just a part of Pep Guardiola’s system.",
      "The Catalan manager tends to leave new signings to it in their early days, meaning Grealish’s numbers were quite good, but as more was asked of him, the former Villa player’s performances took a nose dive.",
      "A great season in the Treble-winning campaign was followed by a stop-start season in 2023-24 and he ended the year with just six goal involvements in 36 games.",
      "Last season he was relegated to the bench, playing just 715 minutes in the league and now looking destined for the exit door.",
      "Summing up his City career then is a difficult task as he was a big part of the Treble success but has been limited since then and you don’t pay £100m for a bit-part player.",
      "Verdict: Miss",
      "3. Declan Rice – £105million\nIt seems odd to call someone who cost more than £100m a bargain but Rice is looking increasingly like that.",
      "Already a talent at West Ham, Rice has improved to be one of the best midfielders in the world and when the likes of Martin Odegaard have gone missing, he has stepped up to the big occasion.",
      "A duo of stunning free-kicks saw Arsenal ease past Real Madrid in the Champions League – the highlight of their season – and you get the feeling that if the Gunners are to break their league title drought, Rice will be key to that.",

      "With Thomas Frank off to Spurs, we have jumped the gun on a possible Brentford exodus and reassigned five Bees stars to rival Premier League clubs…",
      "",
      "A move to a Big Six club had been long overdue for perennial overachiever Thomas Frank as he’s made pretty light work of establishing Brentford in the Premier League, with two top-half finishes and three of his four seasons in the division ending without even the slightest fear of relegation.",
      "It’s a phenomenal achievement for a club of Brentford’s size and it’s a credit to them and Frank in particular, that it would feel weird not to have them in the Premier League with their feet firmly under the top-flight table.",
      "Frank’s move to Tottenham for a supposed upward career move could raise their relegation fears, but the ever-increasing gap to the Championship should cushion their likely decline next season as Leeds United and co. face an uphill battle to buck a disheartening trend.",
      "Brentford’s situation would become more problematic if several key stars follow Frank in leaving this summer, though. With that, we have decided to prepare their supporters for this worst-case scenario (you’re welcome, by the way) by reassigning five Bees standouts to rival Premier League clubs…",
      "",
      "Kevin Schade to Arsenal\nThe Gunners have finally pulled their finger out and caught up with the rest of the footballing world, who some time ago that they needed to sign a new, for lack of a better term, proper striker.",
      "RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko looks to be their man as they are in deep negotiations with the Bundesliga side, while they are also searching the market for a new left winger.",
      "Bukayo Saka has emphatically left Gabriel Martinelli in the dirt, with their respective development heading in opposite directions as the stagnated Brazil international’s uninspiring form has fuelled their interest in potential upgrades, including one ‘dream target’.",
      "With a large chunk of Arsenal’s summer budget likely to be spent on a striker, they may not have the financial muscle to splash out on a direct upgrade on Martinelli and if they decide to pursue an affordable option to compete with, rather than replace, the Gunners star, Schade would not be a bad shout.",
      "The 23-year-old, valued at £25m on transfermarkt amid reported interest from Borussia Dortmund, enjoyed a breakout season in 2024/25 and was a consistent provider of goal involvements, with his final total of 13 in 38 games a more-than-respectable tally.",
      "Rodrygo or Nico Williams would be ideal statement signings for Arsenal to send a message, but the addition of Schade could be enough to give Martinelli a much-needed kick up the arse.",
      "READ: Thomas Frank sack incoming as Spurs and football are stupid, mate",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United\nMan Utd are already doing some good business in this summer’s transfer market, which is especially impressive considering they apparently faced going “bust by Christmas”.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his ever-changing recruitment team have prioritised fixing a key problem area after there was a severe lack of goals in Ruben Amorim’s side last season.",
      "It has not helped that the squad inherited by Amorim was not suited to his 3-4-3 system, but their dire Premier League form ensured they were shot of confidence and the lack of creativity in the side was laid bare as they struggled to forge enough openings at goal.",
      "The Red Devils seemingly have two irons in the fire for a new No.9, while significantly more progress has been made in their overhaul of the No.10 department, with £65m-rated Mbeumo set to follow Matheus Cunha in joining United for four reasons.",
      "This is somewhat surprising given how shambolic United were in the 2024/25 season, but the grandeur of the club is  still enough to lure key targets to their “graveyard”. Mbeumo and Cunha are great signings on paper, but we have been here before and success at Old Trafford, even for these seemingly safe bets, is far from a guarantee.",

The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "Yoanne Wissa to Nottingham Forest\nMbeumo massively stepped up following Ivan Toney’s exit and Igor Thiago’s serious injury, but the same can also be said for Wissa, who also produced his best personal season in 2024/25.",
      "His 19-goal Premier League tally was one shy of Mbeumo’s total as Brentford had two representatives in the chasing pack of big names left behind by Mohamed Salah due to the Liverpool star’s incredible stats.",
      "In previous seasons, Wissa has mostly been used as a winger, but circumstances meant he had to operate as a No.9 in 2024/25 and he seamlessly adapted to this role and is attracting interest from elsewhere.",
      "The age factor is against the 28-year-old as clubs eye targets with a longer shelf life, but Forest plotted an ambitious move in January and their chances of landing him have increased since securing European football. It’s hard to see Chris Wood replicating his relentless scoring next season, so Wissa would be a wise addition as Nuno Espirito Santo’s side prepares to juggle competing in four competitions.",

      "Nathan Collins to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs are reportedly set to fail to sign Man Utd-bound Mbeumo, so Frank will have to look elsewhere if he wants to bring a comfort blanket or two from Brentford.",
      "The caveat of Tottenham’s injury crisis is not enough to justify their shambolic Premier League displays this season, with 22 losses in 38 games resulting in an embarrassing 17th-place finish.",
      "Their much-needed Europa League triumph was not enough to save Ange Postecoglou, but it provides Frank and their recruitment team with a strong platform to build with Champions League football delivering a huge injection of funds.",
      "You have to fancy Frank to steady the ship at Spurs with a more flexible approach than Postecoglou, while his philosophy is front-foot enough to align with the Spurs way.",
      "As Spurs showed in the Europa League final, they can be strong defensively when tasked to do a job on an opposing team and Collins would provide strong competition to their current crop, and this transfer would be needed more if Cristian Romero is shown the door with a move to Liverpool mooted.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard to Tottenham Hotspur\nSpurs only remained afloat amid their wide-ranging injury crisis due to the bottom three being quite so poor, so they need to build a well-equipped squad with quality cover in all positions if they are to compete in several competitions next season.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison are brilliant assets when fit and firing, but they have had their respective issues with injuries and a loss of form this season, so Damsgaard would at least be a suitable squad player for Spurs, especially considering his ability to operate in several roles.",
      "The 24-year-old arrived in the Premier League with plenty of promise but fell short of expectations in his first two years, though he is coming off a standout campaign as he reached double figures for assists in the Premier League and could be another regen of fellow Dane Christian Eriksen.",

      "These 10 guys are the best defensive midfielders available to sign this summer. Arsenal-bound Martin Zubimendi is the best on offer.",
      "",
      "10) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from Nottingham Forest. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "9) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 23 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked at one juncture, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract just weeks ago.",
      "That alone makes him the least likely on this list to actually move this summer.",
      "",
      "8) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nPotentially available on a free transfer, Partey is in talks to extend his Arsenal contract. If he does leave, he could be the bargain of the window.",
      "This was the first season since joining Arsenal that Partey has managed to stay fit throughout, which is typical in a contract year. Had his deal expired any other summer, Mikel Arteta would probably have let him walk.",
      "Not only was Partey reliable for once, he also played extremely well, and quietly became one of Arsenal’s most important players.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye Isak alternative, City to spoil Arsenal plan\n👉 Best attacking midfielders available this summer: Liverpool-bound Wirtz, Rogers, De Bruyne…\n👉 Spend now, sell later? Man Utd could be stuck with bloated bomb squad",
      "",
      "7) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "6) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, reportedly telling the club he won’t play for them again, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 25, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "5) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer, reportedly involving a bit of Italian culture, could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",
      "",
      "4) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80million, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",
      "",
      "3) Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nExpect to see a wave of Chelsea players spending time at Strasbourg, as Todd Boehly continues to treat the French club as his own personal Vitesse.",
      "Santos was one of the most impressive midfielders in Ligue 1 this past season and is the only returning loanee Enzo Maresca has included in Chelsea’s Club World Cup squad, with Strasbourg team-mate Djordje Petrovic missing out.",
      "Despite his huge ceiling, Chelsea seem happy to sell him to fund the next phase of their transfer binge, even if his replacement is worse and has less potential. Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and could move if Partey doesn’t extend his contract.",
      "",
      "2) Ederson (Atalanta)\nThere’s a good chance Ederson ends up in Saudi Arabia, with Club World Cup-bound Al Hilal keen to sign him from Atalanta.",
      "They won’t have him in time for the tournament and struggled to convince top targets before the first summer deadline, so he’s high on their list. The 25-year-old often emerges as a Plan B for clubs chasing midfielders; Manchester City had him on standby if Tijjani Reijnders didn’t move, while United and Liverpool have been linked over the past year.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad)\nTechnically, Zubimendi is available – and reportedly has an agreement with Arsenal.",
      "£51million would be a very solid deal. That’s half the price of Declan Rice and he’s certainly not half the player. Arteta hopes Zubimendi can become his Rodri, and we don’t see any reason why he can’t be…",

      "Their top scorers in the league scored eight goals apiece, and neither were strikers. The highest-scoring striker out of centre-forwards Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee was the former, who bagged four goals in 32 games – one more than the Dutchman in the same amount.",
      "There’s been heavy speculation on the future of the pair, particularly Hojlund.",
      "He has been linked with a move back to Italy – where he played with Atalanta prior to his £72million United signing – with Inter Milan, and Capello feels he’d be a good option.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Friday 13 June 2025 12:16, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",

      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo; Man Utd also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward; he is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford",
      "Monday 9 June 2025 18:40, UK",
      "Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Manchester United also remain admirers of the Bournemouth forward despite having a bid rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo - a player also on the list at Spurs.",
      "Mbeumo appears to be United's priority target after a £55m offer was rejected by Brentford last week - and they are expected to follow up with another offer.",
      "There have been reports that Thomas Frank wants Spurs to sign Mbeumo if he becomes their new head coach - but it is ultimately Spurs as a club that decide who they sign.",
      "Chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Johan Lange call the recruitment shots, with the returning Fabio Paratici also having a say - so a Frank arrival would not necessarily make a move for Mbeumo inevitable.",
      "He is also on the list at Liverpool this summer and is believed to favour playing for a Champions League club - but has not yet ruled out a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It means both Semenyo and Mbeumo's futures remain in the balance as Frank nears the head coach role at Tottenham - an event that may prove pivotal in the outcome for both men.",
      "Tottenham have opened talks with Brentford for Thomas Frank.",
      "Discussions between the clubs over compensation are under way. Spurs have no second or third-choice options. Frank is and has been the No 1 target for board members.",
      "Frank is interested in taking the job and wants to speak to Spurs. Although Brentford do not wish to stand in his way if he wants to move to a bigger club, they do not plan to let him go on the cheap.",
      "Brentford are prepared to listen to offers from Spurs but expect them to be serious ones.",
      "Frank has a release clause in his contract, which has two years left to run. It is widely being reported to be in the region of £10m.",
