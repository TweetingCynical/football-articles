      "Ruben Amorim has lavished Senne Lammens in praise but warned him of the new difficulties he now faces as Manchester United goalkeeper. The Portuguese coach told his summer signing that he has no time to dwell on an impressive debut.",
      "Lammens put in a confident display as United claimed victory over Sunderland ahead of the international break and drew widespread praise for his performance. The Belgian shotstopper came away with a clean sheet as he replaced Altay Bayindir in goal.",
      "The 23-year-old, who signed in an £18.2million deal on transfer deadline day, is now in line to start against Liverpool. Amorim believes Lammens' task is only going to grow more difficult as he is exposed to more Premier League action.",
      "The United boss has emphasised the importance of Lammens continuing to strive for the very best after the early positives he has produced. There will only be increased scrutiny as the goalkeeper makes his name, with opposition sides becoming more familiar with his weaknesses.",
      "\"The first impression is really important in our club,\" Amorim said. \"He had a very good impression.",
      "\"Then he needs to understand in our club the last game doesn't matter, he needs to focus on the next game. Then he needs to understand the game, what kind of players he's going to face.",
      "He needs to understand people watched him during the game, they know how he wants the ball and kicks the ball. All of the small details he needs to improve every day.",
      "\"I think he shows he's really composed. It's a different environment [against Liverpool] but I'm not concerned about that.\"",
      "United face a Liverpool side that has lost three games in a row. Defeats against Chelsea, Crystal Palace, and Crystal Palace have slowed the Reds' momentum under Arne Slot.",
      "Amorim is not expecting anything less than the best from United's rivals at Anfield on Sunday however. The 40-year-old has a great deal of respect for his adversary.",
      "\"Liverpool is the champion at the moment,\" said Amorim. \"They have a lot of talent, a very good coach.",
      "\"You can sense playing Man Utd against Liverpool, the fans are going to be crazy. I'm preparing the game against the best Liverpool.\"",

      "Manchester United will head to Anfield on Sunday to take on Liverpool, having not won at their arch rivals since 2016. Ruben Amorim has largely struggled since taking the reins at Old Trafford in November 2024, however, United's performance away to Liverpool last season remains one of their best under his management so far.",
      "While United didn't take the three points, they held the eventual Premier League champions to a 2-2 draw. The showing was indicative of Amorim's tenure so far, performing well against the league's top sides but stumbling against the so-called 'lesser' outfits.",
      "After the game, Amorim and his United captain, Bruno Fernandes, spoke to the media about their anguish at United's Jekyll and Hyde-like performances. That frustrating trend, however, looks to have continued into this season.",
      "While United have beaten Chelsea, and performed well against league leaders Arsenal this season, they have lost to Grimsby Town in the League Cup, away to Brentford and were held 1-1 away to Fulham.",
      "\"If we play against Liverpool every day we will do that,\" Amorim said after the 2-2 draw last season. \"So we have to do it against any opponent and to understand that we have to fight really bad to get out of this situation.",
      "He added: \"The way we were really competitive, that is the crucial thing going forward. I'm happy for the performance, not happy for the result but I'm really mad because of the other games.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez had put United in front early in the second half of last season's clash. Cody Gakpo's equaliser was then followed by a Mohamed Salah penalty that looked to have secured the three points for Arne Slot's side.",
      "However, Amad Diallo made it honours even, with United even squandering several late opportunities to win the game.",
      "Fernandes later revealed that he was \"upset\" by United's apparent inability to transfer their positive performance against their North West rivals to other games throughout the campaign - a factor that is still haunting United a season on.",
      "\"Criticised and fairly because the position in the table says it all, we lost too many points,\" Fernandes said after the tie. \"Even today we can't be happy with a draw because we need points more than they did. It was a really good result, we could have even won the game in the end but it's a fair result.",
      "\"I'm pretty upset because if we show this today at Anfield against Liverpool, who are first in the league and probably the outstanding team in the Premier League this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "United have not beaten Liverpool in the Premier League since August 2022. However, the Reds head into Sunday's clash with United off the back of three defeats in a row.",
      "Speaking of his side's promising showing last term, Amorim echoed last season's comments in a press conference this week: “Yeah, I remember it, we played well, it was a draw.",
      "\"I was really upset in the end of the game because we proved, on that day, that we can compete against any opponents.",
      "\"I know that it's special for our club. I know that they are fighting all the time for the titles, the number of titles. I know what it means to the fans, but again, it's one game that we need to prove again, that we are playing better.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood earned rave reviews from media across Europe after his stunning four-goal haul fired Marseille to the summit of Ligue 1 with a thrilling 6-2 victory over Le Havre. The former Manchester United forward made history for the French giants as he netted four in Saturday's dramatic encounter at the Stade Velodrome.",
      "Former Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi, who has previously endured some struggles getting the most out of Greenwood, watched his side fall behind to the visitors before the ex-England international levelled from the penalty spot. But the real fireworks were reserved for the closing stages as spectators were treated to five goals in a breathtaking final 25 minutes.",
      "Marseille capitalised on their numerical advantage after Gautier Lloris received his marching orders in the 34th minute. Greenwood, who was reportedly interested in a Premier League comeback in the summer, was the chief beneficiary as European outlets heaped praise on his remarkable display.",
      "Spanish newspaper AS described him as \"A Greenwood from another planet\" in their match coverage. Having found the net 21 times in France's top flight last campaign, the 24-year-old has already got six goals in just eight league appearances this term.",
      "French sports daily L'Equipe described Greenwood's showing as \"a near-perfect performance\" as Marseille climbed to the top of the table. This came despite De Zerbi acknowledging his team's display was far from polished for significant periods of the match.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Le Monde also spotlighted the standing ovation that welcomed Greenwood as he left the pitch in the 79th minute. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also slammed for squandering what ought to have been a certain goal after a \"golden pass\" from his English team-mate.",
      "Marseille made the most of their opponents' shortcomings earlier this weekend. Champions Paris Saint-Germain dropped points after a 3-3 stalemate at home to Strasbourg on Friday, while Lyon also stumbled following a 3-2 loss at Nice on Saturday.",
      "By contrast, Marseille has now secured five Ligue 1 victories on the bounce and leads PSG by a single point for now. L'Equipe also emphasised the importance of his four-goal haul at the Stade Velodrome.",
      "The last Marseille player to net four in a Ligue 1 match was French icon Jean-Pierre Papin, who managed that same sun in a 7-0 demolition of Lyon back in 1991. He also enters distinguished territory after taking his Ligue 1 total to 27 goals in a little more than one campaign.",
      "The last English footballer to reach that mark in France was Glenn Hoddle, who enjoyed four years at Monaco between 1987 and 1991. Marseille will face a much tougher challenge when they visit Lens next weekend.",
      "Nevertheless, it's clearer than ever Greenwood, who joined Marseille from Getafe in a £26.5million move last year, will play a crucial part if Les Olympiens are to claim their first league crown since 2010.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United legend David Beckham has been approached to front a fresh takeover bid at Old Trafford. An unknown consortium from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is gearing up to make an offer for the Glazers' majority shares in the club.",
      "The consortium wants ex-England star Beckham to act as an ambassador for that bid, given his worldwide fame, boasting existing ownership stakes in Inter Miami and Salford City. The group will offer the 50-year-old, who has a net worth of £300million, the chance to invest in United.",
      "The former Red Devils midfielder is the consortium's preferred choice to front the bid. However, other ex-players, including Eric Cantona and Wayne Rooney, have been considered.",
      "United legend Beckham has been critical of the Glazers' controversial ownership in the past, but they would only consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake. That figure is more than double what the club is currently worth on the stock market. The Glazers took control two decades ago in a £790m deal, and the club’s current value is only around £2bn.",
      "However, the US businessmen would demand a big premium to cover any possible future increase in United's value if the club pursues plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos took over football operations after purchasing a 27.7 per cent stake in February 2024, which has since grown to nearly 29 per cent.",
      "Despite Ratcliffe's minority takeover, there have been whispers lately suggesting that the United co-owner may be compelled to sell his share due to a clause in an agreement with the Glazers, should they decide to offload their controlling shares.",
      "Earlier this month, club sources revealed the club hierarchy had been taken aback by takeover talk. Saudi Arabian sports bigwig Turki Al-Sheikh caused a stir among supporters and staff at United when he posted on social media suggesting the club was on the verge of new investment.",
      "Despite later clarifying his comments on social media, the rumour mill has been in overdrive ever since.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has come in for a bit of stick for suggesting his long spells of mediocre form in recent times have, in part, been down to an ‘inconsistent environment’. Neither Roy Keane nor Wayne Rooney were particularly savage in their responses to that suggestion but both came up with mildly stinging rebukes for Rashford.",
      "“He was part of the problem with the environment,” said Keane. Rooney had a similar script, saying: “I think the environment has not been right but that is down to yourself.”",
      "Considering there has been the odd situation in which Rashford’s behaviour away from the pitch has been questioned, Rooney and Keane might well have a point. But any idea Rashford has behaved like some sort of serial wrong ‘un over the last couple of years is way, way off the mark.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "A couple of misjudgements? Yes. But anything serious? No. And if Rashford was referring to managerial churn when he spoke about an ‘inconsistent environment’, then he has a point.",
      "Since Rashford made his Manchester United debut in 2016, there have been - including interim and caretaker bosses - eight managers. Systems, methods, personnel have all changed frequently during Rashford’s professional career at Old Trafford.",
      "Of course, that is no excuse for some of the ineffective - and quite lengthy - periods of football Rashford has produced for United. But it must have had an impact.",
      "The underlying reasons for Rashford wanting to get out of Old Trafford still might have to be addressed as the 27-year-old attacker has a United contract that runs until the summer of 2028. And, of course, the managerial situation might keep on churning.",
      "But this season with Barcelona is now the most important of Rashford’s career. By all accounts, Barca manager Hansi Flick and Thomas Tuchel are not close friends but do have a very respectful working relationship.",
      "Between them, they could yet make Rashford the world-beating player we all know he can be.",
      "Flick has already fired one warning shot across the loanee’s bows, leaving him out of the starting line-up against Getafe after Rashford had been late for training. And in a different way, Flick’s compatriot has done the same.",
      "During the last international break, Tuchel spoke about Rashford having the capability to be “one of the best in the world”, adding there are “no limits” for him. He spoke about him being “explosive”, about him being “fast”, about him being “strong in the air”.",
      "But this is the same Tuchel who has preferred Anthony Gordon to Rashford in the last three of his England starting line-ups. Tuchel talks about Rashford’s “numbers” not being good enough but Gordon’s numbers are not exactly mind-blowing.",
      "But my guess is that Tuchel likes what he sees from the Newcastle winger in training, where Gordon badgers Harry Kane for advice, where he asks goalkeepers to hang around so he can practise his finishing. My guess is that how players commit themselves to even the most routine of training sessions counts for a lot in Tuchel’s book.",
      "Now, there is no suggestion Rashford has not applied himself with anything other than 100 percent commitment in England training. No suggestion whatsoever.",
      "But 100 percent for Tuchel and 100 percent for Flick is all that will do for Rashford if he is to re-invent himself as a world-beater for club and country. Those two guys will stand for nothing less. Let’s hope Marcus gives them exactly that.",

Arteta's squad has earned a formidable reputation for its set-piece prowess in recent seasons and is widely regarded as the most effective team in the Premier League, if not Europe, in both attack and defence.",

This obsession with set-pieces, which was overtaking their whole game - exacerbated by this presence of their set-piece coach on the touchline which puts more focus on set-pieces. It's like... no. The freedom's gone a little bit from them.",

      "Liverpool have the opportunity to reignite their season as Manchester United make their way to Anfield. The reigning Premier League champions were caught out by their defensive weaknesses before the international break.",
      "A trio of losses in all competitions served as a harsh wake-up call for Arne Slot, whose streak of last-gasp wins came to a jarring halt. However, the Reds boast an array of talent within their squad, which, given time to gel, should soon become a formidable force in both the English top flight and on the European stage.",
      "They're set to host a United team that continue to struggle with inconsistency under Ruben Amorim, who will be aiming for his first back-to-back Premier League win after defeating Sunderland 2-0 prior to the break.",
      "Amorim's United did take a point off of Slot's side in this fixture last season. It ended 2-2 on Merseyside back in January, with Amad Diallo levelling after Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah had cancelled out Lisandro Martinez's opener.",

      "Manchester United's rising star Kobbie Mainoo is facing a challenging period in his fledgling career. The 20-year-old midfielder, who was hailed as the next big thing after his impressive performances for England at Euro 2024, has found himself sidelined under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite his versatility on the pitch, Mainoo hasn't started a single Premier League match this season and has only made five appearances as a substitute, clocking up just 113 minutes of play.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "During Euro 2024, Mainoo was a key player in the Three Lions' midfield, helping them reach the final. He played in all four knockout rounds, including the final which England lost 2-1 to Spain.",
      "However, due to his lack of game time at United, he's currently not being considered by Thomas Tuchel. Despite this setback, Mainoo still hopes to make the World Cup squad next year, and Carsley has offered him a chance to join the youth side.",
      "\"No, they're definitely in consideration,\" Carsley explained when asked if Mainoo and fellow-omitted youngster Adam Wharton would be considered for the under-21s side. Neither were picked for England's fixtures over the October international break.",
      "\"They're in the senior bracket,\" he continued. \"I think it's fair to say that they're more senior-end than 21s end. But I think there's always the option.\"",
      "Despite missing out on a call-up this October, Mainoo is ensuring he maintains top physical form. During the international break, he shared an Instagram photo showcasing his gym progress.",
      "This will delight boss Amorim and demonstrates that whilst he's encountered some disappointments, Mainoo isn't allowing his spirits to sink.",
      "With numerous midfield stars having been on international duty with their nations, Mainoo might get some playing time when United make the trip to Anfield on Sunday.",
      "Further evidence of how Mainoo is handling his drop from favour emerged through Fabrizio Romano. The journalist discussed Mainoo on his YouTube platform.",
      "Romano suggests that whilst he put in a loan application during the summer, Mainoo isn't causing disruption at United. He continues to show dedication in training sessions and is determined to establish himself at his beloved childhood club.",
      "It was also emphasised that the Stockport-born midfielder never pushed for a permanent departure from Old Trafford. This indicates that his preferred future lies in Manchester, but he must nail down a regular place before the World Cup.",
      "Some feel that Amorim has been correct to exclude Mainoo from his starting XI despite the potential he possesses. Steve Nicol, who shone for Liverpool during the 1980s, believes Mainoo is a superb player in possession but that his defensive contributions are woeful.",
      "He told ESPN: \"In my opinion, Mainoo is great with the ball at his feet but when the opposition has the ball, he doesn't do enough. In fact, he doesn't do anything.",
      "\"He doesn't stop people getting at Man United's back four. And the fact that that is one of the biggest problems United have and this guy still can't figure it out.",
      "\"I think basically he's been found out because at the end of the day, when you play for the top clubs and you want to be challenging, your players have to contribute on both sides of the ball. And if there is one thing Mainoo doesn't do, it's contribute defensively.",
      "\"The fact that Casemiro is starting over him consistently tells you that there is a problem and the kid is not as good as we thought he was when he first burst onto the scene.\"",
      "Mainoo has made no secret of his desire for more game time, with several clubs reportedly showing interest during the summer transfer window. It's anticipated that these clubs will come knocking again in January if Mainoo's loan aspirations remain unchanged.",
      "The report also suggests that Italian outfit Napoli maintain their interest in Mainoo and may also revisit their pursuit in January. Their head coach Antonio Conte is said to be eager to pair Mainoo with his former United colleague Scott McTominay, who has flourished since leaving Old Trafford.",

      "Bruno Fernandes will remain as Manchester United's penalty taker despite already missing twice this season as Ruben Amorim underlined his faith in the Portuguese star to put those mistakes behind him.",
      "For years Fernandes has been the man trusted to step up from 12 yards, scoring some crucial penalties, but this season he's spurned several opportunities. He skied a penalty at Fulham with United eventually having to settle for a point in west London.",
      "More recently he again missed in the capital - this time at Brentford. With the Red Devils trailing 2-1 Fernandes saw his strike saved by Caoimhin Kelleher before the Manchester outfit went on to lose 3-1, heading more pressure on their head coach.",
      "Amorim though has maintained that, should United get a penalty at Anfield when they take on Liverpool on Sunday afternoon, it will be their captain stepping up to shoulder the responsibility.",
      "He said: \"He's the main taker. He scores a lot of goals. If we need, we can change. But I'm fully confident that Bruno will sort that out.\"",
      "Prior to this season's mishaps the last time Fernandes missed a penalty in the Premier League was against Chelsea in December 2023. United's penalty issues also cost them in the Carabao Cup as they were dumped out by League Two Grimsby - Bryan Mbeumo missing the crucial spot kick on that occasion.",
      "Amorim though has been keen to remind doubters of Fernandes' largely impressive record. \"I know that it's not easy for him,\" he said. \"But I think he has 70 penalties. He misses like eight. Two with me. So I'm really annoyed with that. But he's really confident. He's training the penalties. He's trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. He will be ready.\"",
      "Fernandes has already shown himself more than capable of handling pressure situations this season. The Portugal playmaker was able to convert a late penalty in the 3-2 win over Burnley in August. On that occasion Amorim didn't even watch - convinced his skipper would convert.",
      "He said: \"I like to look at the fans and the reactions of the fans. But I was really confident because Bruno missed the last one. I was not thinking he was going to miss two in a row. So I was really confident trying to imagine what is going to happen in the final minutes.\"",

The Argentine youngster was substituted at half-time during Chelsea's Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest, which saw manager Ange Postecoglou sacked just 17 minutes after the final whistle.",
      "Despite the drama, all eyes were on Garnacho at Old Trafford. The 21-year-old star celebrated with his Chelsea teammates post-match, but it wasn't smooth sailing for him at the City Ground. Garnacho, who left United this summer, was taken off by Enzo Maresca as part of a triple substitution after just 45 minutes.",
      "That move ultimately led to Chelsea's victory, but it was a bitter pill for Garnacho to swallow, especially after a heated exchange with Neto in the first half that was caught on camera.",
      "Now, with tensions seemingly cooled, Fernandes has reached out to his Portuguese teammate Neto. In a brief comment on social media, the United playmaker wrote: \"Chuta que chutas bem.\"",
      "Translated from Portuguese, that means: \"Kick you kick good.\" His response to Neto's post also included a heart eyes emoji.",
      "Neto was instrumental in Chelsea's 3-0 triumph over Forest on Saturday lunchtime, scoring a free-kick and setting up Josh Acheampong for the first goal. Reece James sealed the victory in the final moments, earning Chelsea three points, while Postecoglou was given his marching orders shortly after the final whistle at the City Ground.",
      "\"I know Neto was really frustrated with him. He was crossing the ball and not getting on the other side. Neto was really frustrated with him.\"",
      "Garnacho has already taken to social media himself after the match. Posting on Instagram, he said: \"[I'm] Happy for these three important points!\" along with blue and white heart emojis on his stories.",

      "Former Southampton striker Charlie Austin once lifted the lid on just how close Virgil van Dijk came to signing with Manchester United. However, the Red Devils ended up going in a different direction after opting to sign Victor Lindelof instead.",
      "Liverpool great Van Dijk, 34, had been at St. Mary's for two years already when speculation emerged that United wanted him in the summer of 2017. In a different universe, the centre-back could have been suiting up in the away dressing room this Sunday when United make the trip to Anfield.",
      "But when United failed to agree a deal for the Netherlands international, they signed Lindelof from Benfica instead. And Austin revealed how a deal that could have drastically changed the course of history for two of England's big guns unfolded, or rather didn't.",
      "\"I remember in the back end of his Southampton career we were on the bench together at Chelsea away,\" he told talkSPORT in 2021. \"I sat there and was like, ‘Virg lad, what’s going on?",
      "\"'Surely Manchester United must have been in for you? Massive club in England, etc.' He went, ‘Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was like between me and Lindelof, and they signed Lindelof.'",
      "\"I was like, 'You are joking!' I couldn’t believe it, I was gobsmacked. There was talk of him going there, and then they have taken Lindelof instead.\"",
      "Needless to say Liverpool got the superior player when they eventually plumped for Van Dijk's signature in January 2018. Just six months after a proposal from United failed to bear fruit, Van Dijk joined their biggest rivals for £75million, a world-record fee for a defender at the time.",
      "And Austin provided further detail on Van Dijk's efforts to land a move at the time, even going on strike at Southampton in his bid to leave. It wasn't long before he ended up at Anfield, where he would go on to lift two Premier League titles and a Champions League crown.",
      "\"The manager was there, [Mauricio] Pellegrino at the time, and in the summer he (Van Dijk) was looking to go,\" Austin continued. \"I remember he (Pellegrino) got everyone around at training, including Virg, and just came out and said, 'Look lads, Virgil wants to go, we’re not allowing it and he’s said he’s not going to play, so he’s not going to train with us.'",
      "\"That was in front of everybody. There was no heads-up from the manager. It was stamping his authority. He didn’t move in the summer, two days later the transfer window shut and Virg was starting again on the Saturday. He apologised to the lads but we were like, 'We understand, you were linked with Liverpool and you wanted to go.'\"",
      "It's apparent just how passionate Van Dijk was about joining the project Jurgen Klopp was building at Anfield at the time. United had just won a Europa League and EFL Cup double under Jose Mourinho when the summer of 2017 rolled around, but even that wasn't enough to deter his interest in Liverpool.",
      "The two defenders in question have gone on to enjoy contrasting careers in England. While Van Dijk inspired a new era of success on Merseyside, Lindelof spent eight years at Old Trafford during a period of decline.",
      "The Sweden international has his own successes at United, lifting the FA Cup and Carabao Cup as well as finishing as a runner-up in the Europa League on two occasions. Lindelof left United this summer when his contract expired and eventually joined Aston Villa on a free transfer.",

      "One of Liverpool's great days in recent years came at Old Trafford in October 2021 when they tore apart their arch rivals Manchester United in a five-star display.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side rocked up with the hosts fearing the worst and by half-time the Reds were 4-0 up. The first of those was scored by Naby Keita before Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah let loose on the Manchester goal. United's weaknesses were well highlighted and Liverpool were able to regularly exploit them.",
      "The ease with which they cut Liverpool apart allowed Keita to run through on goal, slotting past David de Gea to begin the rout. The away end would sing songs mocking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer being in charge. Anfield icon Kenny Dalglish grinned in the stands.",
      "Keita arrived at Liverpool in 2018 with a huge reputation. The Reds spent a then club-record £54m to land him from RB Leipzig and the Guinean was adored by those on the red side of Merseyside, even if he was blighted by injury for much of his time.",
      "He previously told The Guardian: “The Liverpool fans have given me a lot of love. Even today, wherever I meet them, they show me the same love. They’re the best fans in the world. Liverpool is a family and you never walk alone. My aim was to fulfil my childhood dream of winning titles.",
      "\"Winning the Premier League after 30 years, winning the Champions League – these are incredible moments that I can’t forget. We won a lot of trophies and we were able to make our fans happy. That was the most important thing. This team was hungry. We wanted to win every game and we were lucky to have Jürgen Klopp to push us to give our best on the pitch. He’s a fantastic coach and he was the strength of this group.”",
      "Keita, who wore Steven Gerrard’s famous No 8 shirt at Liverpool, was part of the side that claimed the title in 2019/20. Their quality was often evident and only a stellar Manchester City outfit prevented them claiming more titles. The year they smashed the Red Devils they would reach 92 points - but missed out on league success to City on the final day.",
      "Keita, still only 30, left Liverpool in 2023 after another near miss in the title race. His minutes had begun declining and he opted for a return to Germany, where he'd first made his name, with Werder Bremen. His move hasn't gone as he'd hoped by his own admission, but the motives behind the move were right.",
      "“I had the option of extending my stay at Liverpool but, after five years, I wanted to get more playing time elsewhere,” he admitted. “I had several offers but I decided to sign for Bremen because Germany is a country I already know. I was also convinced by what the coach and management at Bremen had to say.",
      "\"I just wanted to play football, to be out on the pitch, making passes and scoring goals. If I wanted the money, I would have chosen to sign somewhere other than Bremen. Here, all that motivated me was to have the opportunity to play every weekend, enjoy myself and give pleasure. Unfortunately, things haven’t gone according to plan.”",

      "Ruben Amorim accepts there is a \"lot of noise\" surrounding some of Manchester United's players as he maintained that Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are \"our players that need to have a good season\".",
      "Both men are struggling for minutes at Old Trafford as Amorim seeks to find a winning formula following some heavy summer investment. Zirkzee was signed just over a year ago but the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha has seen him slide down the pecking order.",
      "The same can be said for Mainoo, despite United failing to add a midfielder in the summer. Instead the academy graduate has seen Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes become Amorim's preferred partnership in the middle of the park.",
      "The general consensus is that such a role limits Fernandes but he continues to be picked ahead of Mainoo, who failed to even appear from the bench in the first two matches of the season. He's yet to play a full 90 minutes in the Premier League and Amorim insists he gets their frustration.",
      "He said: \"That is normal, and I also know that in our club, everything is a lot of noise, and you have to have news, and players are not playing. They want to play. Like you said, there’s a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So, I understand that but they are our players, and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",
      "Mainoo was a huge hit under Erik ten Hag, who handed him his debut. The midfielder went on to score in an FA Cup final win and play for England in the Euros, but his stock has fallen since Amorim took charge in Manchester. There has even been talk of Mainoo being sold, which would suit United from a PSR point of view given he is an academy player. The midfielder though is hailed as one of the club's best homegrown talents for years.",
      "Amorim has made it clear that he still wants to see huge improvement from the 20-year-old. \"I believe a lot in Kobbie but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better. He can improve in a lot,\" he said.",
      "Zirkzee meanwhile endured a difficult debut season at Old Trafford. He and Rasmus Hojlund couldn't supply the goals United needed, leading to their recruitment drive in the summer. But whilst Hojlund left the Dutchman chose to remain.",
      "The ex-Bologna frontman could now be offered a route back to Italy with Roma, who are considering a loan move come January. Hojlund has rediscovered his best form since heading back to Serie A and has impressed with Napoli, who sit level on points at the top of the table.",

      "Manchester United have been told their goalkeeping problems could last for several more years after failing to sign an experienced No. 1 this summer. Andre Onana was the Red Devils' first-choice keeper for the last two seasons, but constant errors saw him given permission to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on loan late in the most recent transfer window.",
      "United were linked with a number of seasoned shot-stoppers as they eyed a replacement, including Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. However, a move for Martinez failed to materialise and he ended up staying at Aston Villa, while Donnarumma made the switch from Paris Saint-Germain to join United's fierce rivals Manchester City.",
      "A new goalkeeper was eventually welcomed at Old Trafford after an £18m deal was agreed for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old was handed his debut by United head coach Ruben Amorim just before the international break, keeping a clean sheet in their 2-0 win over Sunderland in the Premier League.",
      "But doubts persist over whether Lammens is the answer to their woes between the sticks given his lack of experience outside the Belgian Pro League. Former United keeper Ben Foster has now voiced his astonishment that they didn't try harder to sign Martinez or Donnarumma.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Watford and Wrexham star said: \"I was really shocked [that they didn't sign Martinez]. I thought it was an absolute no-brainer. Even with Gigi Donnarumma, I thought it's a no-brainer so just get it done.",
      "\"You need that guy. You might have to pay over the odds for him and you might have to pay a heavy wage, but that position is then settled.",
      "\"They didn't do it and I think it could become a situation where it might just rumble on for a few years now. I'm willing to give Lammens a chance because he got off to a fantastic start against Sunderland but it's a big ask.\"",
      "Onana is currently enjoying happier times following his temporary move away from United and an improvement in performances in Turkey. However, Foster insists Amorim was right to let the former Inter Milan keeper leave, despite questioning his choice of replacement.",
      "He said: \"When you make the amount of mistakes that he made, then it's inevitable that eventually you're going to get turfed out. It's just the way that it goes. He's probably a little bit too hectic as a goalkeeper.",
      "\"None of it is calm and composed and in big moments, there were saves that he was making that just looked a little bit too erratic. It's like he would panic in those moments.",
      "\"They're the moments where you need real calmness under pressure, when the ball is coming at you at 80 miles per hour. He didn't have that ability and I thought he let the pressure get to him a little bit too much.\"",
      "Trabzonspor are understood to be exploring the possibility of signing Onana on a permanent basis. His intention though is believed to be to make a return to Manchester in the hope of re-establishing himself as United's No 1.",

      "Manchester United travel to Anfield today for a battle with their fierce rivals Liverpool - and Ruben Amorim has a few headaches to contend with. The Red Devils head to Merseyside having endured a poor start to the season.",
      "While they managed to get back on track against Sunderland before the international break, the Premier League champions represent United's biggest challenge so far. And given the opponents, boss Amorim will certainly want to have all his best players available.",
      "That might be easier said than done, with United having sustained a few injury issues so far this season, while a host of players missed training ahead of the weekend’s trip to Anfield.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes was one of those to be absent after international, while summer signing Matheus Cunha was also sidelined. They were joined away from training by Amad and Casemiro.",
      "Starting in goal, summer addition Senne Lammens appears to now be United’s number one and he should start once again against Liverpool. Moving into defence, Amorim will no doubt deploy his back-three of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro.",
      "Lisandro Martinez - who has been out with a long-term knee injury - is closing in on a return but is not quite ready to play yet. Meanwhile, Amorim hinted that Noussair Mazraoui could miss out.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Amad should be stationed on either flank. Patrick Dorgu is another option, but despite missing training on Thursday, Amad should get the nod to start.",
      "And while Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro both had limited training time ahead of this weekend’s game, they are both highly likely to be in the side if they are fit enough. Moving into attack, United’s frontline should have a relatively familiar look.",
      "Benjamin Sesko will lead the line over Joshua Zirkzee and will be supported by fellow summer arrival Bryan Mbeumo. The final decision that Amorim has to make is over whether to play Matheus Cunha or Mason Mount.",
      "Given the ex-Chelsea man netted against Sunderland last time out, Amorim might feel that he has done enough to retain his spot in the side. Cunha was among those to have missed training in the build-up to the game so may have to make do with a place among the substitutes.",
      "Giving an update on his side’s fitness, Amorim said: “Licha is not available. Near but he is just returning. I don't know about Mazraoui. The international players are ready but we need to give them more time. The guys who are returning are ready to play.”",

      "Up next for Manchester United in the Premier League is a date with Liverpool, in one of the biggest rivalries in world football. Liverpool started the season with seven straight wins in all competitions, but that seems a long time ago now after they racked up three defeats on the bounce before the international break.",
      "Ruben Amorim's United have been inconsistent this far, languishing in the middle of the table with three wins to their name in the Premier League. However, with such a big game on the horizon, a win for either side could be a catalyst to properly get the ball rolling.",
      "A former coach of Senne Lammens says he could become the best goalkeeper in the world and has identified the behaviour which exemplifies him as a professional.",
      "The young Belgian shot-stopper penned a deal with United during the summer alongside the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and more.",
      "When he arrived to sign the contract, he was dressed in a simple navy sweatshirt and polo - a very rare sight in the modern game, when huge salaries are often coupled with designer clothes and a generally more luxurious taste in attire. He kept it simple on international duty, wearing a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" said former coach Hayk Milkon.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Following these comments, he suggested Lammens could become the very best: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.\"",
      "Rik de Mil, head coach of Club NXT when Lammens first broke through, offers a similar tale about his behaviour on the training field. The pair also worked together at Club Brugge, when De Mil spotted Lammens' work ethic. After working late at the training ground, De Mil noticed the goalkeeper returning to the gym alone for a late-night training session.",
      "He said: \"He had been sitting at home, thinking I’m doing nothing here, so I’ll go back to the training ground and I'll be all alone there in the gym. He added: \"We always talked about keeping that balance of pushing and being ambitious, but at the same time, sometimes giving yourself a break. He put a lot of pressure on himself.\"",
      "Paul Scholes has identified Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire as three players who can't cope with Premier League football.",
      "The trio are all aged above 30 and United are in need of further squad rejuvenation in the coming windows, with the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba being touted as potential replacements for Casemiro, who is heading for the exit door in 2026.",
      "Scholes told The Times: \"Shaw, Maguire, Casemiro, they’ve all been great players but they’re at a stage of their career now where you get found out in the Premier League if you’re not physically good enough.",
      "\"Their bodies are not athletic enough, they’re not strong enough, they’re not quick enough. They’ve dropped to a level where they can’t cope with what’s needed in the Premier League.",
      "\"Every player in the Premier League is an absolute machine. They’ve got five per cent body fat, they can run, they’re strong, they can head it. Manchester United are carrying two or three players that are just not capable of living with it.\"",
      "United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has defended his manager after the latter received criticism for his system. The Portuguese manager has received negative feedback for his 3-4-2-1 formation, with the Red Devils sitting in mid-table despite a summer of splashing the cash.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Scholes have previously criticised Amorim's tactical approach, while Gary Neville launched a rant about the manager after the loss to Brentford.",
      "Speaking to The Telegraph, De Ligt chose to defend his boss: \"We’re improving as a team. In modern football even if you play a back four almost all teams play by building with three defenders. And we do often defend with four defenders.",
      "\"It’s always easy to say ‘system this, system that’. But, in the end, it’s always adaptable in the game. There’s no situation where the system is always the same in the game. In that way of being flexible and in the structure we have to find a way to get everything right and make everything happen.\"",

Ugarte has been disappointing, albeit he did emerge with credit from the first half against Manchester City.",

      "Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but his request was blocked and Amorim said he must compete with Bruno Fernandes to start.",
      "The 20-year-old has not started in the Premier League this season and has been limited to five substitute appearances. Mainoo is desperate to represent England at the 2026 World Cup after featuring at Euro 2024, but he needs to be playing regularly to be included in Thomas Tuchel's plans.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation. The Dutchman is keen to represent the Netherlands at next summer's World Cup, but he's been given just 82 minutes across all competitions.",
      "Mainoo continues to be linked with a move away in the January transfer window and Zirkzee could look to leave if his situation does not improve, but Amorim suggested they are important squad players.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he understood why Mainoo and Zirkzee would be frustrated, especially in a World Cup season, and he responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So I understand that, but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim joked he is \"really annoyed\" with Bruno Fernandes after missing two penalties for Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes has scored the most penalties for United in Premier League history (23).",
      "The midfielder established himself as the designated penalty-taker during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure and only briefly lost that responsibility during Cristiano Ronaldo's second stint at the club.",
      "Before this season, Fernandes had last missed a penalty against Chelsea in December 2023. The midfielder's penalty record has been exemplary, but he sent a penalty over the crossbar against Fulham at Craven Cottage and his penalty was saved against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Fernandes converted from the spot in added time against Burnley to secure a late victory, but his two penalty misses have led to suggestions that a new penalty taker could be appointed.",
      "Speaking at Friday's press conference, Amorim was asked whether United could change their designated penalty taker, and he laughed as he said he was annoyed with Fernandes.",
      "\"No,\" said Amorim about changing the penalty-taker. \"I know that it's not easy for him. But I think he has 70 penalties. He misses like nine. Two with me. So I'm really annoyed with that.",
      "\"But he's really confident. He's training the penalties. He's trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. So he will be ready. We have more guys also to score a penalty if he needs.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify whether Fernandes remained the designated penalty taker and responded: \"Yes, he's the main taker. He scores a lot of goals. Penalties are passing this moment.",
      "\"We have other options. If we need, we can change. But I'm fully confident that Bruno will sort that out.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "Ruben Amorim has hinted Manchester United will use a direct approach against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long, which helped United move up the pitch.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim spoke to journalists at Carrington on Friday afternoon. United's head coach was asked about the direct approach and hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "\"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" said Amorim. \"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win.",
      "\"When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "United have not won at Anfield since 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge, but Amorim said his players have enough reasons to be motivated without showing them old away victories.",
      "Amorim said: \"I have so many things to use [motivation techniques] with our players. Like winning back-to-back games, to have that momentum that can change completely. I felt the game against Chelsea when we won the week was so different. We have a lot of things to use with the players.",
      "\"I think they don't remember these games [wins at Anfield]. Football players nowadays don't watch many games, unfortunately. We have so much to use. That is not the hardest part.",
      "\"We have so much to win if we perform and win the next game. I don't need to use those games [United wins at Anfield] in the past. We just need to show them what that could bring for our future.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",
      "Anfield will be raucous on Sunday afternoon. \"We showed last year,\" said Amorim about whether his players will handle the occasion. \"I think the way we start the game is more important than the environment. The environment can change. Of course there will be a corner, an opportunity.",
      "\"The environment is going to be loud. But we are ready to play with that. If you look at last year, sometimes we play better in that kind of environment than under the pressure at home. We never know what is going to happen.",
      "\"It's really important to start the game well. To do a really good warm-up. To have a feeling. To understand that it's going to be tough in the first moments. I know they are ready. But we need to prepare for the impact, especially for the beginning of the game.\"",

      "David Beckham has disclosed that wife Victoria received specific guidance ahead of his milestone 50th birthday celebration.",
      "The footballing icon marked his half-century on May 2 this year with a lavish celebration surrounded by family and friends, welcoming A-list guests including Tom Cruise, Guy Ritchie and Gordon Ramsay to his exclusive dinner party in London. Yet, beyond the sparkle and sophistication of celebrations and getaways, the straightforward tradition of present-giving continues to be a family custom, with Beckham describing a particular instance where he felt compelled to make a special appeal for a crucial purpose.",
      "The England icon featured on the most recent instalment of Salford City FC's documentary series on YouTube, offering supporters an exclusive glimpse into the inner workings of the club.",
      "He engaged in conversation with former teammate Gary Neville across a range of subjects, with the pair discussing financial matters.",
      "When considering future planning, Neville told how he incurred substantial financial losses after a disastrous pension investment.",
      "The former right-back subsequently enquired whether Beckham had encountered anything comparable.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",
      "\"My wife is quite...,\" Beckham started, before Neville interjected: \"Prudent?\".",
      "\"Very,\" Beckham replied. \"I will go and buy her a handbag and I know she's going to like it, so it doesn't matter what I spend on it. Then, she won't. For my 50th birthday, I had to say, don't buy me anything s***,\" recounting the telling five-word message.",
      "He added: \"I did! I said, I've never asked for anything significant. I want significant for this one birthday! To be fair to her, she did well!\".",
      "Beckham's admission that he rarely requests anything substantial, despite his enormous wealth alongside wife Victoria, demonstrates how he has maintained his down-to-earth character, regardless of the celebrity status and recognition.",
      "David and Victoria notably appeared in a 2023 Netflix documentary which, whilst mainly concentrating on the former United star, also highlighted elements of their shared life together. One of the most beloved and amusing moments from the series featured the ex-Real Madrid midfielder interrupting his wife's interview to make sure she was being truthful, highlighting the fantastic rapport they share.",
      "In the clip, Victoria had just claimed that the pair were very working class, prompting Beckham to intervene, asking her to be honest and reveal what vehicle her father used to collect her from school. She acknowledged it was a Rolls Royce before Beckham simply responded: \"Thank you\" before leaving the room in a humorous scene.",
      "At Salford, Neville and Beckham are supervising a significant transformation at the club. Over ten years ago, when the Class of '92 assumed control, the team colours were altered to red - a decision which was not received favourably.",
      "However, it has now been disclosed that Salford will revert to sporting orange kits, signalling the conclusion of a 12-year era in red. Neville and Beckham finalised the acquisition of their ex-team-mates' shares in May, introducing a new ownership structure that includes businessman Declan Kelly and former banker Lord Mervyn Davies.",
      "After comprehensive discussions with supporters, the colour change has received an overwhelming endorsement from 77.1% of fans. The club is also undertaking efforts to refurbish seats, cladding and carry out additional infrastructure enhancements.",

      "The back three is unlikely to change considering how stable it seemed against the Black Cats but there could be alterations to the wing-backs. Amad, who started against Sunderland, may drop to the bench due to the attacking threats that Liverpool pose.",
      "Instead, Diogo Dalot could switch from the left flank to his more favoured right with Patrick Dorgu filling in on the other side. Should Casemiro come through his back-to-back 90 minutes for Brazil unscathed, he could partner Bruno Fernandes in the centre.",
      "This of course means no place for Kobbie Mainoo once again in the United starting line-up. Mainoo has yet to start in the Premier League this season.",
      "In the front three, we can expect to see Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko joined by Mason Mount. Mount's determination and commitment to the team can never be questioned and if he remains injury free, he could play a key role under Amorim.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "When former Blackburn Rovers academy coach Mike Sheron first became aware of Adam Wharton, the midfielder was just 12 years old and while it was far too early to make a judgement on what type of player he would become, there were already hints of the talent he possessed.",
      "\"I have been in and around Adam on a daily basis throughout his time at Blackburn,\" Sheron told MEN Sport this week. \"He has always been a fairly quiet young lad but he had an inner confidence about himself.",
      "\"He had a velvet touch, straightaway you were drawn to his ability to control a football and he used his body particularly well. His weight of pass was exceptional and as he got older you became more critical on how to build your team and you just had to go through him.",
      "\"He would never give the ball away, nine times out of ten he was picking the right pass out and it has been a joy watching him develop, it has been brilliant this last 18 months to see what he has been doing.\"",
      "When Palace paid £18million for Wharton in the 2024 mid-season transfer window, he was relatively unknown to most in the Premier League bubble, but at Ewood Park he had already become a firm fan favourite.",
      "Wharton grew up in a Blackburn-mad household with an incredibly supportive family and network surrounding him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reminiscing over one particular trip to Middlesbrough, it was easy to see why Sheron holds Wharton in such high esteem. \"From our point of view, as coaches, if you had a flaw in your set-up, in your session design, he would find it and he would exploit it,\" the 53-year-old who departed Blackburn in September explained.",
      "\"He would always find a solution to increase his chances of winning for his team and he made you a better coach as well, not just influencing the players around him, he made you a better coach and it was really enthralling to work around him. It is definitely rare [for a player to better you when you're a coach] and it is not something that you come across too often.",
      "\"I felt, as a coach, you never had to give him too many details, he would just figure it out for himself. Like everything else, there is more than one way to do things, so you don’t tell him what to do, you give him a broad landscape of: ‘This is the way that we are wanting to try and do things today, but overall it is down to yourselves how you go about it’.",
      "\"One story I do have of him is that we went to a day event at Middlesbrough, an Under-14s player-led tournament. Basically, all of the players would pick the teams, come up with the tactics and we just had to watch from afar.",
      "\"We actually went with an Under-13s set-up because we knew our group at the time at Under-13s was very good. It was Adam’s group, which also had Harry Leonard who is now at Peterborough and Kristi Montgomery who is in and around the first-team now, and they did exceptionally well, but I think Adam, again, was pivotal and was a major factor in us winning that tournament that day.",
      "\"He had that quiet leadership, he doesn’t shout, he doesn’t dictate but he has that inner belief about what he is doing and how to be successful. A lot of the time, he was right.",
      "\"He didn’t agree with everything that you would tell him, you would sometimes criticise his work ethic but he didn’t expend a lot of energy if he didn’t have to, and he was quite good at that. You see him doing elements of that now.",
      "\"You don’t see him running around everywhere, he just gets himself into good positions, he reads the game and that technical ability has ensured he has done fantastically well.\"",
      "A common theme of the conversation about Wharton was the midfielder's 'inner confidence and belief'.",
      "Wharton never needs to be the loudest voice in the room but he knows he can influence players and the game with his own ability. Sheron spoke with pride when remembering how Declan Rice and Harry Kane spoke so glowingly of him after his first England appearance.",
      "When quizzed about Wharton's best position in the midfield pivot, Sheron, who also worked in the youth set-up at Liverpool, insisted that the England international has the ability to suit whichever role the manager needs at any given time - even comparing him to a United favourite. \"Personally, I always felt he was best suited in and around the No.6 role,\" he continued.",
      "\"I like how they have done it at Palace as a lot of the time he is in with a Will Hughes or he is in with another player and there are two sitters. But in a team that is dominating possession, I don’t think there is much of a problem if he is the single pivot.",
      "\"His composure on the ball is second to none, he hardly ever gives the ball away, he can use both feet, read situations, he is so intelligent with his positioning to intercept but it has been a shock to see how well he is doing because you just never know.",
      "\"His game has really gone to the next level around more dynamic players and I would have him down as someone like a Michael Carrick who is really football-intelligent and composed, it really has been a joy to watch him develop.\"",
      "Such a talented player is exactly what United need to mix up their midfield next summer. The midfield department went untouched this previous window as focus gravitated towards the attack.",
      "The concern for the Reds is whether they would be able to attract Wharton without necessarily having the Champions League football which Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish suggested he would crave in the future. Fortunately for the Reds, Sheron believes that an immediate move to a Champions League club is not necessarily the be-all and end-all at this stage.",
      "\"We are all aware of United’s standing in the game and the frustrations they have had in the last couple of years, but who would have thought that going to Crystal Palace would have been a fantastic move?\" Sheron said.",
      "\"If a team sells the club to him and his family and advisors, and he feels that it is the right move for him, then I don’t think it is a case of him needing to go to Manchester City or Liverpool or Arsenal, I think it is a case of whether he gets the vibes that he is going to be valued, be a big part of the team going forward and we all know the animal that Manchester United can become. So I wouldn’t say it is a yes or a no on United, but rather whether the move is the right fit for him.",
      "\"I would put my faith in Adam, who has made a few good decisions, to make the right decision and if he thinks Manchester United is the right fit then it will be. Adam will make other players play better and other players will get their confidence up playing with him.\"",

      "Manchester United might have dropped a hint on who will start against Liverpool this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Matheus Cunha and Amad were among the players to miss full training, albeit club sources confirmed some of the absentees completed recovery work.",
      "Casemiro was absent from training because he played 90 minutes in away friendlies for Brazil against South Korea and Japan during the break. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will not be on Amorim's Christmas card list.",
      "Casemiro would have been a nailed-on starter against Liverpool, but his workload during the break raises questions over how ready he will be to start.",
      "It seems unlikely that Amorim will start the 33-year-old against Liverpool, given he has trekked halfway around the world to Asia and played the entirety of both friendly matches.",
      "That means Manuel Ugarte will be under consideration to start at Anfield. Ugarte was not included in the Uruguay squad for the international break and will be fresh compared to Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte was also a surprise starter against Manchester City when domestic football resumed following the September international break. He had last been seen on a pitch in the defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Casemiro was named on the bench against City and Ugarte performed well in the first half, although he didn't cover himself in glory when he made his next start against Brentford.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment because he had thrived when they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, however, he has been unable to earn a consistent starting role.",
      "It did not reflect well on Ugarte that United looked at midfielders of his ilk in the summer transfer window.",
      "Ugarte was signed for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024, and United have already conceded they need a new signing in the same mould.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte are the most likely midfield partnership at Anfield. Ugarte does not inspire confidence, but his performance at Anfield in January should provide some encouragement ahead of Sunday's clash.",
      "Ugarte started alongside Kobbie Mainoo in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool at the beginning of the year. The pair worked brilliantly together and Ugarte looked like the player United thought they were signing.",
      "Perhaps another start at Anfield will spark another improved performance from Ugarte.",

      "Mazraoui has not played since September 20 due to an unspecified injury and Amorim admitted he doesn't know whether he will be involved this weekend.",
      "Revealing the team news for Liverpool, Amorim said at his pre-match press conference: \"Licha [Martinez] is near and almost returning to training with the team. Mazraoui, I don’t know.\"",
      "Martinez's knee buckled when he fell to the ground against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February, and it was confirmed that he had suffered an injury to his cruciate ligament.",
      "His return to a matchday squad is not imminent and staff will not take any risks.",
      "Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break, but he confirmed those players will be available on Sunday.",
      "\"The rest of the guys with the international teams, they are ready,\" he said. \"But if you saw the games, some players were in Japan, so we need to be careful and give more time.",
      "\"Diogo [Dalot] didn’t play the last game, he was here, Bruno [Fernandes] played 62 minutes, we tried to give one more day. We tried to balance everything to have the guys ready, but the guys returning from international break, they are ready.\"",
      "Speaking about Senne Lammens, Amorim added: \"He did a great job [against Sunderland] and it's possible he will start the game. The first impression in this game is really important. To maintain the level is even more difficult.",
      "\"He is not (Peter) Schmeichel yet, he is a young guy with talent and has shown a lot of composure.\"",

      "Few matches mean more to Manchester United fans than their clashes with Liverpool. In recent times, trips to Anfield have not been happy ones for the Reds, regardless of who has been in the dugout.",
      "Their last victory on the red half of Merseyside came in January 2016 when Wayne Rooney scored the winner for Louis van Gaal's side. Despite their poor recent record at Anfield, United have enjoyed better displays there since the 7-0 debacle which plagued Erik ten Hag's tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Back-to-back draws precede this latest visit to Anfield and United will be hopeful of going one better on Sunday to end their near-ten-year wait for a victory at Liverpool. If they are to come away with the bragging rights, one key decision that Amorim will need to get right is his front three.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo are almost guaranteed to start. However, the other No.10 position is up for grabs with two players hoping to get the nod: Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Mount finds himself in pole position to start having scored against Sunderland prior to the international break. Amorim is a big fan of the former Chelsea man and he finally looks to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha has yet to get off the mark for the Reds. The Brazilian has shown glimpses of why he was brought to the club but his lack of goal contributions this season needs to come to an end, sooner rather than later.",
      "Some may argue that starting him at Anfield and allowing him the chance to get off the mark against Liverpool would be a vote of confidence for Cunha. But United should be looking to stick with their selection from the win over Sunderland.",
      "Mount is the player with confidence at the moment and he has been given a good rest since the win over the Black Cats given he has been out of the England picture for some time.",
      "Cunha has been on international duty with the Brazil national team this week in Asia and there is no telling what his fitness levels will be after that long flight back to Europe.",
      "A potentially game-changing role off the bench for the 26-year-old could be the smartest option.",

      "The Old Trafford favourite has been linked with a potential takeover at United amid fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "During the international break, takeover rumours sparked when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for the club.",
      "After clarifying that he was not the potential investor, it has since been reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a possible takeover. Cantona has been mentioned as one of the individuals included, potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him support a prospective consortium.",
      "The Frenchman has been critical of both the Glazers and minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in recent weeks. Back in April, Cantona made a drastic move that spoke volumes about his stance on the current state of affairs at United.",
      "Alongside members of his family, Cantona became the latest co-owner of FC United of Manchester.",
      "The manifesto on the club's website states that they hope to \"create a football club which addresses the concerns which many Manchester United fans have had over the 17 years or more with how the club and football have developed, culminating in the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer\".",
      "The Northern Premier League club was established in 2005 and is fully owned by its supporters on a \"one member, one vote\" basis, with members voting on all major decisions, such as ticket prices and the design of playing shirts.",

      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",
      "\"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",
      "Biancheri subsequently made his debut for Wales Under-21s in September and has this week scored his first goal for his country in a fine 2-0 win over Austria.",
      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned that he may not be able to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko with his current set-up.",
      "The 22-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in a £74million transfer from RB Leipzig this summer, with Manchester United pipping Newcastle United to his signature. And while the Slovenian impressed in the Bundesliga, he has failed to make much of an impact in the Premier League.",
      "At present, Sesko has scored just two goals from seven appearances for the Reds, and while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he is clearly still a player in development in one of the most physically demanding leagues in the world. And according to former United star Danny Simpson, history could repeat itself at the club if the striker doesn't receive the right support.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips about United's business this summer, Simpson said: \"I think, right, if we are going to play 3-4-3, which we're doing, and not 4-3-3, which now would suit [Bryan] Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes] and [Matheus] Cunha and Sesko - to be honest with you, I think it would - why didn't we buy a centre-mid?",
      "\"You know, let's not pick one of the two, Mbeumo and Cunha. But did we need them both? And you could have had Bruno and one of them and a centre-mid, so Bruno's not playing deep.",
      "\"So, yes, in terms of that, were they trying to get a centre-mid? Maybe they did and he didn't get it over the line - the lad from Brighton [Carlos Baleba], but it was a lot of money. Listen, they brought great players in, but in terms of what we actually need, it's not working right now.",
      "\"Obviously, we prefer Bruno higher. Sesko, I think he will come good, but I just think he also...It would help him to have an experienced striker with him, similar to what's happened with [Rasmus] Hojlund.",
      "“We don't want that to happen again, where it just becomes a point where it's like, so young, it's such a burden, that shirt up front on your own, you've got no help, and before you know it, it's too much.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in a £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, but failed to live up to his price tag in the years that followed. The 22-year-old managed just four Premier League goals last term from 32 games last season, as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko were brought in this summer to give United an attacking edge.",
      "As a result of inconsistency in the north west, Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan this summer, with the Serie A giants holding a £38m obligation to buy the player next year, based on certain requirements being met.",
      "While he is thriving with his new club - with two goals from four games to his name - some fans believe that the issue with his time at United was not having the support of a senior striker to show him the ropes as he continued to develop.",
      "Meanwhile, over in Naples, Hojlund has the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lorenzo Lucca to impart their wisdom on him both on and off the pitch. It comes as Amorim will hope for more consistency from Sesko when the club return to Premier League action this weekend.",
      "The Reds are currently gearing up to face Arne Slot's Liverpool on Sunday, October 19 at Anfield in the first Northwest derby of the season.",
      "While United won their last top flight clash ahead of the international break with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, Liverpool are currently suffering a three-game losing streak thanks to losses at the hands of Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones is embarking on a journey towards management.",
      "The 33-year-old, who hung up his boots last year, has set his sights on securing a top position in the future but acknowledges he must still prove himself worthy.",
      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United supporters ought to be worried by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's commitment to giving Ruben Amorim the full duration of his three-year contract to demonstrate his managerial credentials - despite the difficulties faced during his opening 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils appointed Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement last November, but as he approaches his first year in charge, he's secured victory in fewer than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's poorest-ever campaign last season.",
      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they've won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they've got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",
      "Amorim has yet to secure back-to-back victories in the Premier League since arriving in Manchester. United claimed a crucial three points against Sunderland prior to the international break, but now travel to Anfield this weekend, facing an uphill battle.",
      "Victory for Liverpool could intensify scrutiny on the United manager, though Ratcliffe has dismissed speculation surrounding his position following each defeat.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" he said last week. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "\"We've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward,\" said Mason Mount after winning against Sunderland.",
      "\"For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils fanbase were sent into a frenzy last week with wealthy Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh insisting that an interested party are at ‘an advanced stage’ of buying Man Utd.",
      "Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "But, after realising that some Man Utd fans were speculating that he or another Saudi Arabian was looking at buying the club, Al-Sheikh clarified his comments.",
      "Posting again the day after, Al-Sheikh wrote: ‘My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "‘Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I’m posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.’",
      "READ: Liverpool vs Man Utd: Five pre-match predictions from Rooney, Keane, Redknapp et al.",
      "Reports suggested that the group wanting to buy Man Utd is a UAE-based consortium with Red Devils officials apparently holding a ‘meeting’ with them earlier this week.",
      "And now, according to the Star and Mirror (via The Independent), ‘the consortium would like former United winger Beckham to be an ambassador for the bid’.",
      "Beckham has been ‘approached to back a takeover bid’ with the group reportedly ‘preparing to make an offer to buy the Glazers’ majority shareholding in the club’.",
      "When asked in July 2023 if the Glazers should go, Beckham said in an interview with The Athletic: “I think so. I think it’s purely because the fans want it.",
      "“Once you lose the fans, especially at a club like Manchester United, it’s hard to get them back.",
      "“Obviously, they (the Glazers) have achieved a lot, and financially, the fact we’re even talking about the numbers of what Manchester United will sell for shows the success they’ve had. But there needs to be change. We’ve all seen that, we all know that.”",
      "On whether he could see himself having a role at Man Utd in the future, Beckham added: “I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business.",
      "“But I haven’t been approached and I suppose any involvement with Manchester United would mean the world to me, going forward. But who knows?",
      "“We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. Hopefully, a decision gets made and if I’m involved in any way… if not, I’ll be a United fan and just do what all the other fans are doing – turn up and watch our team.”",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has described the potential implications of Man Utd’s share price increasing by eight per cent amid recent takeover rumours.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “It’s a reaction to the media stuff we saw around the Saudi Arabia potential, the quote from the fairly well renowned Saudi Arabia individual who put this out there and speculated around a takeover that’s what’s driven the share price up ultimately.",
      "“It’s absolutely fuelled by speculation around a takeover. For what it means for the club, it’s more for the shareholders, the investors, any share price going up reflects positively on them ultimately and that means that the share price is higher.",
      "“It won’t make too big a difference to the day-to-day finances and the operations of the club. In terms of the share price going up you treat those things as good news stories for a company that the share price is increasing.",
      "“That share price ultimately is going to benefit the shareholders and the investors at a certain point in time, which is again the other side of the coin with this one because the current owners don’t look like they want to sell right now and Jim Ratcliffe came in for the minority stakes so its them who would benefit from a share increase but obviously they are not looking to sell the club.”",

      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Nottm Forest was handy, too.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "Amorim says he “needs” Zirkzee and Mainoo but he’s got a funny way of showing it. His optimistic season target would be a year too late for the Man Utd ...",
      "A ‘petty hate narrative’ on Ruben Amorim has been debunked, while we have an extended England World Cup ladder that includes Gary Neville…",
      "According to reports, a ‘shock’ Manchester United manager target is confident of being chosen to replace head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "A former Manchester United player has explained why he thinks head coach Ruben Amorim has a “personal” problem with one of his players.",
      "Phil Jones would like nothing more than to see Ruben Amorim thrive at Man Utd, but is far from convinced.",
      "The Premier League is back, and with it a whole bunch of beleaguered managers who could really do with a win to silence the haters."

      "All three Chelsea players who scored against Nottingham Forest claimed their first Premier League manager scalp in doing so when Ange Postecoglou was sacked.",
      "The following is a rundown of the players who scored in a Premier League manager’s last game before losing their job. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",

To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "A total of 249 different players have induced one manager exit by scoring at least once in their final game. This number includes such names as Celestine Babayaro (Kenny Dalglish, Newcastle), Jon Flanagan (Andre Villas-Boas, Spurs), Vinnie Jones (Ron Atkinson, Aston Villa), Gary O’Neil (Peter Reid, Leeds), Arturo Vidal (Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea), and Josh Acheampong, who helped put Ange Postecoglou out of his Nottingham Forest misery.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",
      "There has been major upheaval at Man Utd in recent months as INEOS sanctioned a significant squad overhaul after last season’s 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "The Red Devils invested around £230m as one of the summer’s biggest spenders to sign Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they offloaded most of the deadwood.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund were among the players to move elsewhere in the summer, and it has been assumed that Casemiro will leave when his current contract expires in 2026.",
      "However, Casemiro has played regularly for Man Utd this season and a new report from Football Insider‘s Pete O’Rourke has ‘backed’ them to ‘agree a new deal’ as long as he accepts a pay cut after this was ‘unthinkable a year ago’.",
      "READ: ‘Petty’ Amorim ‘hate narrative’ debunked as 50 more stars in extended England World Cup ladder",
      "It does appear that Hojlund’s future is away from Man Utd as Romano recently claimed that there is a “99%” chance of his loan to Napoli becoming permanent next year.",
      "Now, Romano has doubled down on this claim and pointed out that the Red Devils are “quite convinced” that they will sell Hojlund next year.",
      "“Manchester United are quite convinced that that obligation to buy will be triggered for Rasmus Hojlund,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Hojlund is expected to stay at Napoli. The transfer fee is already clear. €6 million already received by Manchester United as loan fee and €44 million for the by option close becoming an obligation under certain conditions.",
      "“Hojlund will also have a release close at Napoli valid from 2027, not next summer but from summer 2027 for €85m.”",
      "It has also been suggested that Joshua Zirkzee could leave Man Utd next year as he has only been a bit-part player this season.",
      "It has even been reported that the forward is unhappy at Old Trafford, though Romano has confirmed that he is happy to “fight for his place”.",
      "“With Zirkzee, he is fighting for his place at Man United and he wants to fight for his place at Man United,” Romano added.",
      "“In January last year, Juventus wanted him but he decided to stay. United decided to keep him in the summer even with Italian clubs back at the table.",
      "“Zirkzee is very happy to stay and fight for his place. But now it’s October. He is not playing that much. So obviously he is not happy with the current game time but it doesn’t mean that he is unhappy with Man United or he is pushing for a move.",
      "“At the moment he is training hard, working hard and trying his best to help Manchester United.",
      "“Obviously if they get to January in the next three months and Zirkzee keeps not playing, that could be a possibility for him to explore a move away in a World Cup season, but at the moment nothing about this. So we will see in January but it will depend on the game time.”",

      "Despite this, Rashford will reportedly ‘quit’ Man Utd even if his move to Barcelona ‘collapses’, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming that “there will be no shortage of interest in him”.",
      "“It’s a sad thing from Man United’s point of view that I don’t see him coming back, but I have no doubt there are a lot of clubs keeping an eye on his situation,” Brown told Football Insider.",

      "“If he doesn’t stay at Barcelona, there will be no shortage of interest in him, especially if he can keep up the form he has shown.",
      "“But ideally I think he’s got his heart set on staying at Barcelona and hopes he can stay there long-term, and if he keeps performing I don’t see why they wouldn’t keep him.”",
      "Romano, meanwhile, claims Rashford “could be open” to having a “different kind of salary structure” to “facilitate a potential move to Barcelona”.",
      "“In all the conversations he has had with Hansi Flick and in all the conversation also internally at Barcelona with people at the club, Marcus Rashford is being very clear his desire is to be a Barcelona player beyond this season,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rashford is doing very well. He’s very happy with the club, with the coach, with the city, with the teammates, Rashford is loving his life at Barcelona and the idea for Rashford is to try to stay at Barca if they decide to keep him and if they will be able to reach an agreement with Man United, either triggered by their buy option of close to €30 million or to negotiate with United.",
      "“We will see what happens in summer 2026 if Barcelona want to keep Rashford. In that case, my understanding is that Rashford could also be open to have a discussion on a different kind of salary structure compared to his current one at Man United in order to facilitate a potential move to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford already changed his salary structure in order to join Barcelona, but United are not paying his salary. Barcelona is paying the main part of the salary and the other part is something that Marcus Rashford decided to accept not to take in order to be a Barcelona player this season.",
      "“It’s still very early to predict the future of Rashford, but there is a very good feeling between Rashford, Barcelona and Flick. Obviously we have to see in the second half of the season what happens.",
      "“Nothing will be decided now in October, in November, in December, this is not the time to reach agreements for summer 2026. But the feeling now is very good.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror.",

      "A ‘petty hate narrative’ on Ruben Amorim has been debunked, while we have an extended England World Cup ladder that includes Gary Neville…",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com…",
      "So there was a call for reply by an Amorim supporter and though that’s not how I’d class myself the fact I don’t want his head on a pike likely means that’s how you see me. Your regular letters bashing United for one thing or another needn’t come with a warning like Stewie’s rants because you can see them coming a mile off, and though this current thorn in your arse regards the academy we all know its rooted in the decision to ditch your messiah Ten Hag 12 months ago. Time to get over that one I think.",
      "However to stay on topic, the talents you’ve singled out are indeed promising players though which Fletcher are you referring to? Them being twins does mean there are two of them. The choice of Lacey and Biancheri seems more about their slight builds than anything, they are still teenagers though so perhaps that always be the case and you only have to look at Amorim favourite Bruno to see that if you’re good enough then size doesn’t matter to him.",
      "The academy does have many other promising players and some might be very well suited to the current system. Where are your comments on Kone, Scanlon, or Ibragimov. The Fletcher brothers could do very well and so too Mantato. Its almost like you chose a few very specific examples to help push your Amorim hating narrative.",
      "You don’t actually care about the progress of these lads at all. We can see this in the total absence of concern for all those previous academy lads that didn’t make it at United. I don’t recall your furious letters demanding United change how they play for the delicate Shoretire and where was your anger for Andreas Periera, James Garner, and Angel Gomes.",
      "When it comes down to it your base argument is backward. The academy exists to produce players that are good enough for the first team. The academy adapts to the first team requirements, not the other way around. If some players make it then great, if they don’t then I’m sure they will have good careers elsewhere, that’s the simple fact of every academy. Trying to twist this into a negative against the current manager who you don’t like is just petty.\nDave, Manchester",

      "Hi Mailbox,",
      "It’s my view that the pool of England qualified players is deeper than I can ever recall. 10 years or so ago I think it was probably hard to find 50 plausible players to fill the ladder. I thought to myself today – ‘all of those 50 (apart from Phil) are perfectly plausible contenders for an England squad, I wonder whether we can get to 100’. So I tried that.",
      "Short answer is, no I don’t really think there are 100 plausible options there, but there might be 75. I’d be interested to know what others think!",
      "Here’s the list:",
      "51) Liam Delap – given the paucity of non-Harry Kane striking options, Delap will leap way into the top 50 if he can get fit and scoring. Big if, but he has the tools.",
      "52) Mason Mount – we know Tuchel likes him, and understandably so given his excellence in Chelsea’s European Cup winning campaign. Presses well, consummate team man, but significant competition in the attacking midfield means he would need to up his game significantly . This might be difficult in such a dysfunctional side as Man Utd.",
      "53) Benjamin White – has he declared himself available? Not sure. And possibly not getting enough minutes, given the form of the exemplary Timber. But has a great relationship with Saka and can defend well, thus ticking a couple of Tuchely boxes.",
      "54) Rico Lewis – despite being just 20 he has 62 Manchester City appearances and 5 for England, however he hasn’t made a squad for more than a year. He’s a skilled, adaptable operator but the feeling persists that he may be too physically slight for both Tuchel and Pep for his preferred full back and defensive midfield roles.",
      "55) Eric Dier – with 49 caps, he could be a leadershippy, experiencey squad pick in the mould of Jordan Henderson. He’s somewhat versatile and is still playing regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. In a 26 man squad, he wouldn’t be the worst 26th man.",
      "56) Tyrick Mitchell – unlucky to only have two England caps, but could be hampered by playing as wing-back in a back three system that England are unlikely to deploy. He’s been integral for Palace and might deserve a chance in a position that is yet to be definitively claimed.",
      "57) Angel Gomes – a key man for Lee Carlsey, who used his passing skills as a crucial midfield pivot. He’s been surpassed by Elliott Anderson and probably Adam Wharton too, but he is playing Champions League football at Marseille and could be a decent option if required.",
      "58) James Maddison – badly injured, but could he play his way into contention by getting fit and firing by the end of the season? Probably not.",
      "59) Joe Gomez – it’s hard to believe he’s still only 28, but he’s a dependable and versatile defender who rarely lets Liverpool down when called upon. He’s suffered a bit with injuries, but given the form of Konate, I could easily see him getting a run in the Liverpool side, which could precipitate a return to the England reckoning.",
      "60) James Tarkowski – he’s a really good defender, in the head it and block it mould of Dan Burn, and like Burn he’s probably an underrated distributor too. A substantial England career might have passed him by, but I wouldn’t be concerned if I saw him in the squad.",
      "61) Rio Ngumoha – if he were to nail down the spot on the left of Liverpool’s attack, his talent is such that he could challenge Gordon and Rashford for a spot. This will probably happen one day, but it’s unlikely to be this season given he’s just 17.",
      "62) Jamie Gittens – frankly it’s a bit odd that a player signed for nearly 50 million from Dortmund by Chelsea is this low, but I haven’t really seen him do anything much in a Chelsea shirt as yet. Perhaps he’ll explode into life in time to make a late run into squad contention.",
      "63) Tyrone Mings – was thrown into the England Team in Euro 2020 (2021, really) and let nobody down. I can’t really see a repeat happening, especially given Villa’s form, but you never know.",
      "64) James McAtee – the captain of the successful England U21 side in the summer, he’s not really found his feet at Forest yet. He’s a tidy and skilled player, but will have to motor to warrant consideration in such a stacked position.",
      "65) James Garner – playing really well for Everton under Moyes and could definitely be a thought if messrs Anderson, Henderson and Wharton were all to get caught in some sort of freak yachting accident.",
      "66) Alex Scott – same as James Garner, really.",
      "67) Jadon Sancho – what has gone on with him? Chelsea paid money to avoid signing him permanently. Clearly, there is talent there. He showed that when loaned back to Dortmund, but he’s never shown it in the Premiership and that looks unlikely to change at Villa, who clearly only signed him in desperation.",
      "68) Tyler Dibling – a fun player to watch and a sensational dribbler, but currently doesn’t have the end product to truly push himself into contention. I’m not sure that will change this season, but am hopeful it may in the future.",
      "69) Archie Gray – acquitted himself well while playing out of position in a dreadful Spurs side last season, but has only played 72 premier league minutes this time round. A talented player who may go onto win many caps, but I suspect that his time is still to come.",
      "70) Callum Hudson-Odoi – he was stellar for Forest last season, and may even have deserved a return to the England fold, but Forest being quite so poor this time around cannot he helpful. Has the kind of pacy direct profile that Tuchel seems to value.",
      "71) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – he’s a nice player and a good signing for Everton. I’d be surprised to see him picked given all the talent in his position.",
      "72) Max Dowman – a generational talent. Unbelievably good for his age. But his age is currently 15. So yeah, bit early.",
      "73) Marcus Tavernier – who is the most unfairly overlooked English player in the Premiership? This guy. Consistently a strong contributor for the excellent Bournemouth, he’s in the top 15% of Premier league attacking midfielders for progressive passes, tackles, and aerials won. Will this be enough to get him in the England squad? Not a chance.",
      "74) Jacob Murphy – on the subject of being overlooked… if it was ever going to happen for Murphy, it was probably last season, where he received no sniff of a call-up despite 8 goals and 12 assists. Unfortunate really, but it’s not going to happen.",
      "75) Jacob Ramsey – Newcastle spent big money on him in the Summer and have wanted him for some time. He moves with the ball very well. However, he’s not really played much in the black and white, so doesn’t seem a likely prospect.",
      "76) Lloyd Kelly – it feels a bit weird that a Juventus first-team central defender is English and yet he is nowhere near the England squad, but here we are.",
      "77) Brooke Norton-Cuffy – funnily enough, he’s also been linked with Juve, and he has been looking a fine prospect for Genoa and the England u-21s. He can certainly get up and down the right touchline with aplomb and might feature one day. But not soon.",
      "78) Max Kilman – he’s been closer to the England team at points in the past. Doesn’t help that West Ham are faintly rubbish.",
      "79) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – his England career is probably a thing of the past. But we aren’t exactly replete with back up strikers, so a decent run of form could drive him upwards on this list. Do I think that’s likely? No.",
      "80) Jobe Bellingham – the lesser Bellingham, but not lacking in talent. He probably needs to stop his dad from bickering with the powers-that-be at Dortmund and put a sustained run of form together. Even if he does, it’s likely too soon for him.",
      "81) Jack Hinshelwood – always looks pretty good at Brighton and quite versatile too. I’d be quite surprised to see that translate into England caps in the short-to-medium term.",
      "82) Fikayo Tomori – if it was ever going to happen for Fikayo, it’s not now. Shame really. He was born in Canada – might be worth exploring that.",
      "83) Josh King – an ever present for Fulham this season and a lovely, balanced dribbler. Definitely too soon for him.",
      "84) Charlie Cresswell – played well for England u21s and a strong player for Toulouse. Probably needed a move to a bigger club if he was going to contend for the World Cup squad.",
      "85) Tyler Morton – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Lyon and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "86) CJ Egan-Riley – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Marseille and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "87) Omari Hutchinson – Forest signed him for biggish money after a ho-hum season for Ipswich. Looked excellent for the u21s. Doesn’t feel a natural fit for Dycheball if that’s what Forest see-saw into next.",
      "88) Eddie Nketiah – hasn’t really done much for Palace, but it’s probably a little hard when Mateta is an imperious first choice. Still, as with a few on this list if he puts a run of goals together, there may be a squad spot for the taking.",
      "89) Ryan Sessegnon – has been deputising ably for Antonee Robinson and it’s great to see him back to fitness and form, however it’s hard to see how that translates into becoming an England player.",
      "90) Anthony Patterson – haven’t named a goalkeeper in the above. I’d like to have done so but couldn’t think of one. Patterson isn’t even number one at Sunderland. Where have all the good English keepers gone?",

      "Hi there,",
      "Keir Starmer has condemned the decision by West Midlands Police to ban away supporters from Aston Villa’s home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv . Now, this decision seems to have been taken a) because there is a legitimate fear that protests against Israeli clubs’ participation in sporting events, in a diverse part of an inner city in the UK, could have public order implications, and more importantly b) because the last time these supporters played a fixture in Europe, they committed serious public order offences in Amsterdam.",
      "There are allegations and counter-allegations about the nature of the supporters’ behaviour in Amsterdam, but it seems that Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were in some cases the victims of racially-motivated abuse and violence, but also, and this is not denied by anyone, also the perpetrators of racially-motivated abuse and violence.",
      "You can have an opinion about whether or not Israeli clubs should be banned from international sporting competition (for the record, there’s a fairly compelling case that Israel have repeatedly violated FIFA and UEFA statutes, and there is the clear precedent of Russia who have been suspended from international competition following their invasion of Ukraine) and you can have an opinion about whether or not this decision is particularly risk-averse, but linking this, as both the Prime Minister and LOTO have, with anti-semitism is prima facie absurd, and actually quite dangerous.",
      "If supporters of an English football club rioted in another European City, and a subsequent European city’s authorities decided that they couldn’t be doing with them, then I don’t believe that the Prime Minister or Leader Of The Opposition would have anything to say about it at all. So why are they making a stand on behalf of supporters of a club from another nation?",
      "Maybe it’s the politicians who should be keeping politics out of football, not footballers past or present?\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "Apologies for this, but I need to put my thoughts across on another instance of politics crossing into football so please feel free to stop reading at this point if you’re not interested or cba with it all.",
      "Yesterday my club Aston Villa put out a statement to say that on the advice of the Safety Advisory Group, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be allowed to attend our match with them in the Europa League on 6th November.  As someone who will be attending the match myself, I welcomed this decision on the basis that it has been made on safety grounds – for those that have never been to Aston, it is a heavily Asian populated area with quite a few mosques so the introduction of a set of fans who have previously been known for racist and aggressive behaviour abroad doesn’t require a lot of mental gymnastics to see how this has got the potential to be a very dangerous situation.  For anyone that isn’t aware, this makes for some very interesting reading.",
      "Now we have various politicians including our very own prime minister chipping in to say that the decision is wrong and “antisemetic” – but is it? Antisemitism is defined as “prejudice or hatred against Jewish people, which can manifest as hostile actions or rhetoric toward individuals, their property, or Jewish community institutions”.  I’m pretty confident in saying that this decision wasn’t taken based on the fact that Maccabi fans are Jewish but instead that a number of their fans are savages that can’t control themselves.  Yes you can station more police at Villa Park but what’s going to happen to the people who live in the surrounding area? How are you going to police every nearby street to ensure public safety? Whether you agree with it or not, there are more than a few houses with Palestine flags hanging from the windows in Aston – how do you see this playing out if/when Maccabi fans on their way to the ground walk past?",
      "To those that say “banning all fans is unfair to those who just want to support their team”, I don’t disagree with you but the moronic element don’t exactly wear badges or uniforms so what else do you do? Matches behind closed doors is one option, but then you’d have to do that for every game Maccabi play in Europe so why even take part?",
      "I honestly and truly believe that this decision has been made in the interests of public safety and for no other reason.  As I type this email, the government are “trying to find a way to reverse the ban” – assuming they are successful in doing so, I expect each and every one of them to be back on TV the following morning to be held responsible for making it happen and the carnage that will undoubtedly follow, which of course they won’t.  This is the equivalent of holding a lit match over a bucket of petrol, it’s really not going to end well at all.\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (Wondering how many of these politicians will be at Villa Park to see the match in person….)",

      "No surprise here that the Premier League’s top scorers (15) also have the most open play goals (13) with their striker automaton in the form of his already abnormal footballing life. The point of interest here is Arsenal, who are now title favourites having leapfrogged Liverpool at the top of the table despite scoring a paltry five goals from open play in seven games.",
      "The Gunners fans will claim they don’t care how they win the title, but we thoroughly look forward to the boring, boring Arsenal discourse that’s sure to gain momentum if they continue to rely so heavily on winning games of football from set pieces, ahead of the very firm beliefs of all rival fans that any prospective title win doesn’t actually count on that basis.",

      "Manchester United legend Jaap Stam has revealed his bold prediction for the 2025/26 campaign as he’s backed Ruben Amorim’s side to finish above Chelsea.",
      "The Red Devils have been heavily criticised at the start of this campaign as they have lost three of their opening seven Premier League games, while they have suffered a shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Therefore, head coach Ruben Amorim has come under huge pressure and he remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked after United’s 2-0 win against Sunderland.",
      "This means Amorim and Man Utd need to follow up this win with more positive results, potentially starting with Sunday’s match against arch-rivals Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "Ahead of this match, Man Utd are tenth in the Premier League and five points adrift of the Champions League positions, but Stam has backed his former club to finish in the top four and finish ahead of Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "READ: Amorim will sacrifice three academy kids ‘on the cheap’ to Newcastle after Ratcliffe pop",
      "“These five have the squads and consistency to compete for the Champions League places.",
      "“Bournemouth or Crystal Palace could make a push, but it’s hard to maintain that level through the season.",
      "“The big clubs will end up there again because of the quality of players they have in their squad.”",
      "As well as “the quality of players” in Man Utd’s squad, Stam reckons another factor in their favour is that “it’s still early” in the season and a “few wins can change everything”.",
      "“At the start of the season, I said the top four should be the target for Manchester United,” Stam added.",
      "“They’re only a few points off that, so it’s not a disaster. It’s still early; a few wins can change everything. Momentum and confidence come from back-to-back victories.",
      "“If they can build that, they can finish in the top six, maybe even top five, though it’ll be tough. Winning games is always the best medicine.”",
      "Stam has also explained why he thinks Arsenal can beat Liverpool to win the Premier League this season.",
      "“Arsenal can win the league this season,” Stam insisted.",
      "“Mikel Arteta has built a team with quality and a clear playing style that’s hard to play against. The owners have backed him, and you can see the progress.",
      "“They’ve spent a lot to strengthen, which shows ambition. Now they need to make that next step and by spending the amount they have, they’ve shown they want to take that next step.",
      "“With their depth, they can rotate and keep up the quality. They’re consistent with how they’re playing; they are top of the league and now they need to keep it up until the end of the season.",
      "“I wouldn’t say Mikel Arteta’s job should immediately be on the line [if Arsenal don’t win any trophies], but there will be pressure.",
      "“When you’ve been backed and invested heavily, expectations rise. The club will expect progress and trophies. When you are the manager of Arsenal, that’s what you know and that’s what you’re there for.",
      "“If that doesn’t happen, of course questions come. That’s normal in football. But there’s still a long season ahead, and they’re in a strong position.”"

They have also suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",

      "After Liverpool’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea, Blues full-back Marc Cucurella revealed Enzo Maresca’s pre-game directive to target Liverpool’s right flank as a point of weakness.",
      "Cucurella said: “We know that Salah is always ready for the counter-attack so we practiced that and the manager said that the space might be there [on the right side of Liverpool].",
      "“We saw that it was the last minute but we kept attacking. I tried to give my last effort and Enzo gave me the ball and I crossed for Estevao.”",
      "It was a public avowal of an awareness of a chink on the Reds’ armour that we’re guessing most Premier League managers already recognised, but have previously been mindful of looking to exploit to any great extent owing to the dangers Salah posed in the other direction.",
      "Former Liverpool full-back Steve Nicol hit out at Salah for “walking around in a daze” and claimed the forward must be ignoring Slot’s instructions to track opposition full-backs.",
      "“99% of players, when things aren’t going well for them, we understand that it’s fine as long as they work hard,” Nicol told ESPN. “But he seems to be walking around in a daze. Those breaks with Cucurella, Salah is not even thinking about him and why is that?",

      "“Could they be holding talks behind other people at the club’s back? Absolutely. Are they advanced? No. And then where does the money come from? Well, Turki Al-Sheikh confirms something that we broke on this show, that it’s not Saudi Arabia.",
      "“I don’t want to disappoint the chat, but Sheikh Jassim is not coming back to the table. There is no possibility, I am told. And in addition to that, the number the Glazers want is in excess of 5 billion pounds. And if you go back through the SEC filing to look at the different bids from shape, none of the offers were anywhere close to that number.",

After some all too predictable knee-jerk media nonsense claiming the La Liga giants were considering sending him back to United after his first couple of appearances, a narrative about-turn now sees Rashford’s displays as proof of the rotten core of the football club he departed in the summer.",
      "That’s a far more difficult concept for your Roy Keanes, Gary Nevilles and Wayne Rooneys to accept though.",

      "“Let’s ignore that,” Neville said. “Because I don’t want to go into Marcus Rashford comments tonight. He was there at the club for 10 years and had his opportunity to impact the club. Ruben Amorim, this year, I think will do a good job. Marcus should concentrate on Barcelona.”",
      "Keane then questioned whether Rashford had the “intelligence” to succeed at Barcelona, asking: “Do you reckon he’s got enough football intelligence to go over there and adapt to a different league, different football, different lifestyle? Has he got that intelligence on and off the pitch to make it work?”",
      "The evidence so far suggests that Rashford does indeed have the required football nous to thrive at Barcelona, and while we may feel the need to caveat that as a result of a career beset with false dawns and inconsistency, all of that instability coming while playing for Manchester United allows for an easy hypothesis, as drawn by the man himself in response to Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only think preventing Rashford from being seen as a world class talent is his lack of consistency.",
      "“For sure, consistency is a massive part of it,” Rashford said. “I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time, so it is even more difficult to be consistent.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe clearly doesn’t rate the Manchester United academy and Ruben Amorim has an inflexible system, so there is concern over three young stars.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "Since we’re nearly back to the real football, just been reading some reviews of how players did at U21 level, because while Sir Rat doesn’t think the academy is producing the goods, there’s actually a good number of very exciting talents, particularly Fletcher, Lacey and Biancheri.",
      "The latter two are particularly interesting, being that one is a winger and the other a small agile finisher in the mould of Aguero.",
      "And so, thoughts turn to how they get a passage into the first team. If there’s any staunch Amorim supporters about, I don’t suppose you’d care to share a view? Y’know, in the context that we don’t now use wingers (maybe Lacey can be adapted to the 10 but there’s 6 ahead of him) and there’s a general preference for tall and strong strikers.",
      "I’m afraid it goes back to the issue of a system requiring and using only certain types of player, without ability to accomodate or adapt to the talents available. Where would Scholes, Giggs or Beckham have fitted into this set up if they were breaking through now? Neville as a CB?",
      "Anyhoo, answers on a postcard or BTL very welcome.",
      "If the answer is “they just have to wait until this guy is sacked” that’s fine, but Lacey is 19 and needs to get a path to senior football soon. Which has vibes of “ones that got away” when we sell him to probably Newcastle or Everton on the cheap.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "I’m going to start this by being very clear. I like Thomas Tuchel. Lots.",
      "But equally, it is becoming abundantly clear that you lot (our wonderful media, and even F365 possibly included) do not. You don’t like him, you didn’t want him, and that narrative is being driven and reinforced on, what seems like, a daily basis, and at every conceivable opportunity.",
      "And that raises a justifiable question. Why??",
      "I’m too old and too grumpy to take too much notice of WCQ game stats, but the man has overseen a 100% win record with no goals conceded. And before anyone says “yeah but, these groups are a joke, full of part timers etc etc, just maybe have a word with your most accessible Sweden or Italy fan, and ask them how it’s going.",
      "Tuchel is quite clearly, a decent, educated, well spoken (even when not using his native tongue) and most importantly, very successful football coach. So, what’s the problem with him?",
      "So far with the media, he has been open, honest, forthcoming and, more importantly, consistent about what he is trying to do and how he is trying to do it. Why not take the man for his word? Don’t forget, he has a very short-term contract, with a very clear target.",
      "It almost seems that if some training cones went missing from St George’s Park at the moment, Tommy T would be served with a Search Warrant for his garden shed.\nAndy FTM (Some San Miguel glasses were lifted from my pub on Sunday, but know it wasn’t Tommy T so no need to ask him at the next presser)",

      "Tuchel has made them balanced on both wings and made them fly. Oddly he’s leaning intelligently on Newcastle’s team while Sven was stuck with Manchester United’s Ferguson dripping poison in the ear of his boys for the England squad. Howe is nurturing a good set of hard working players in his squad that compliment what Tuchel needs. Gordon running up the left wing is a pleasure to finally see happen. What might have been against Spain in 2024? And he scored! Woltemade is a perfect sort of striker for Gordon as a proxy for Kane.",

      "Nevertheless Ollie Watkins is fine and Liam Delap will improve .",
      "No one saw Harry Kane coming through until he did so the hext generation striker is probably ripping it up in an academy somewhere.",

      "There have been an interesting range of comments in recent mailboxes on Harry Kane, some focussing on his goalscoring prowess whilst others felt his barnet required closer evaluation (…“he’s a nifty, 50’s binman !” (© Shooting Stars..)).",
      "So I thought I would jot down a few thoughts from an older England fan’s perspective.",
      "There can be no doubting of the man’s goal-scoring prowess – that is undeniable and he remains one of the most clinical finishers around, as he has been for a number of years.",
      "However, I start to feel slightly more uncomfortable with certain messaging that I hear from parts of the media when they eulogise about his build up play, with it almost being painted that he should be allowed to do that because … because he’s Harry Kane ! .. record England goal-scorer … he can do what he wants !",
      "The guy can clearly play some great, incisive passes (an aspect of his game that has come more to the fore in the last few years), but that doesn’t mean he should be given full licence to drop into those positions away from the forward line for England to attempt that. What was clearly evident at the last Euro’s (where there were lots of calls for him to be dropped from the starting 11 during the tournament, me being one) was that he stodged up our build up play by dropping deep.",
      "I also think we need to recognise that one of the areas where England have a high talent pool relative to the world stage is at the number 10 / attacking midfield position – Rogers has had the shirt in the last couple of games, with the likes of Palmer, Bellingham and Eze patiently waiting (Palmer is the pick for me – such an intelligent footballer in terms of his ability to find pockets of space and defining attacking patterns of play). It would be disappointing to me if all 4 of those names don’t make the plane to the US.",
      "So, back to the job demarcation point. For me, Tuchel should be telling Harry that he wants him to play as a number 9 that predominantly plays within the width of the penalty area and in the attacking line. That should be his job, to finish the chances created by others – think of it like a Gerd Muller role who was one of the best there has been in terms of finding the onion bag, but who had a very talented German team behind him to give him those opportunities.",
      "If Kane could adopt that narrower role for England, I think it will improve our overall chances of success.\nSparky, LFC (liking what Tuchel is doing .. refreshing to see the manner he has selected squads / teams in recent times .. regardless of reputation, everyone needs to earn their place .. I can get behind that).",
      "",
      "I understand that it’s the interlull and everyone is bored but I thought the Neville/Flag War debate would be over on Football365 even though it raves in elsewhere.However, the initial article was very left wing and condescending to right wing readers in order to stir the pot and encourage readers to react. So, as much as I held back, here’s my tuppence worth.",
      "Now, Neville has every right to say what he said. Also people have the right to disagree with him. What’s amusing is that Neville in his dramatic video appears to be using ‘mirror politics  i e. having a go at ‘angry middle aged white men’ causing division when that’s exactly what he is.and what he’s doing (especially in Salford). Can’t he just express his views rationally father than impersonate Richard Ashcroft with his remix of ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony? I think Jaap Stam sums him up in his autobiography by calling both the Nevilles ‘busy c**ts’ implying they are both angry people who complain about this, that and everything! Also, Neville’s timing of his comment linking it to a degree with a  terrorist attack on Jews was inappropriate and wrong",

      "1. Remove heading from the game. We know it’s terrible for kids’ brains, it’s probably not great for adults’ brains. It adds so little. In fact, only ~15% of premier league goals are headers. I think taking away defenders’ option to head the ball clear would increase the number of goals, at least initially.",
      "2. Remove penalties from the game. Foul in the box is just like a foul anywhere else. If an obvious goal is stopped a la Suarez v Ghana, just award a goal.",
      "3. Stop the clock when the ball is out of play. Everyone whinges about time-wasting. I read article after article about the ball only being in play for ~54% of time blah blah blah. Just make the game 60 mins and stop the clock. Add a “restart play” of 15s for throw ins, 30s for corners/free kicks in the attacking half.",
      "4. Ditch automatic VAR. Give the manager “challenges” like tennis or NFL, but you lose a sub if you get it wrong. Let them challenge ANYTHING; absolutely believe that throw in was the wrong call? Bet a sub on it. No subs left but you’ve just conceded a final minute winner that you think is bullshit? Too bad, you should have managed your challenges/subs better.",

      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees value in backing Man Utd at Liverpool.",
      "The international break can be a problem for some managers - not Unai Emery.",
      "Aston Villa are unbeaten in the last 10 Premier League games after an international break, winning eight. Whatever Emery does in this fiddly time for managers is working wonders.",
      "Meanwhile, Spurs' encouraging start to life under Thomas Frank has been somewhat undermined by a pair of disappointing results in their last two Premier League home games after being battered by Bournemouth and only drawing with Wolves courtesy of a last-minute equaliser. It means Spurs have won just three of their 17 Premier League home games since November last year.",
      "Villa are an obvious play on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "The markets haven't quite woken up to just how sharp Amad Diallo has looked recently, nor how well he's linking up with Bryan Mbeumo, who's become his perfect foil in United's new-look attack.",
      "There's a real chemistry brewing here.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo might not have been the attacking duo many expected to define this United side, but their movement and understanding has been electric and could just be the catalyst for Ruben Amorim.",
      "At 9/2 to score with Sky Bet, the value's there on Amad.",
      "And against a Liverpool side that's been anything but watertight down their left flank, this looks the perfect storm for the United hotshot to make a big statement.",
      "Liverpool will, as always, dominate territory and possession but that only increases the space Amad can exploit on the counter. Pair that with his on-field connection with Mbeumo and United have the tools to create more problems for Liverpool, who do look short at 4/7 with Sky Bet for maximum points.",
      "West Ham are in 'season-defining' territory already.",
      "The Hammers are winless in eight home Premier League games, a run that played a huge part in Graham Potter losing his job. It's their longest winless run since moving to the London Stadium and, in its current miserable guise, the place feels a world away from Upton Park.",
      "When you're knee-deep in a relegation scrap, you don't need talk of 'underlying numbers' - you need street-fighting survival football. Nuno Espirito Santo brings exactly that.",
      "Call it what you want - reactive, pragmatic and at times boring - but it's effective when backs are against the wall. West Ham need points and Nuno will bag them plenty based on his body of work. The home win looks the call here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
