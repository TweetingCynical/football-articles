      "Manchester United wasted the chance to move back into the Premier League top four after being beaten by ten-man Everton at Old Trafford on Monday evening.",
      "The drama started within the opening 15 minutes as Everton star Idrissa Gueye was sent off after clashing with teammate Michael Keane. Despite the disadvantage, the Toffees rallied and even took a surprise lead thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's eye-catching strike.",
      "United pushed for an equaliser but found England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford as an unbeatable barrier. And his performance was crucial to the Toffees holding on to secure what was an unlikely victory.",
      "Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "Midfielder Gueye has been one of Everton's most consistent players over recent seasons but a sheer moment of madness saw him dismissed at Old Trafford. After clashing with his own teammate Michael Keane, Gueye appeared to raise his hand to the defender's face.",
      "The pair were embroiled in an angry argument, with Gueye striking out and earning himself a red card. It's one thing getting dismissed after a bad tackle or becoming frustrated with the opposition, but it's another earning an early bath for a fight with your own teammate.",
      "He now faces an automatic three-match ban for violent conduct. There's no doubt that boss David Moyes will be absolutely furious - and rightly so.",
      "With nearly 80 minutes to come against ten men, the Red Devils had a real opportunity ahead of them. Not that you'd have known it throughout the majority of the first period as Everton claimed a shock lead.",
      "It was a stunning goal from midfielder Dewsbury-Hall that broke the deadlock. He picked the ball up outside of the penalty area, shrugged off a couple of challenges and curled a brilliant effort past the despairing dive of Senne Lammens.",
      "It was an eye-catching display from the midfielder, who now seems to be at home in the Premier League.",
      "After being involved in the incident that saw Gueye dismissed, former United defender Keane was then at the heart of one of the flashpoints of the second period as the hosts pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, who was the Red Devils' most threatening player throughout the game, appeared to have a great chance as the ball dropped to him in the penalty area. As he stretched to fire home, he appeared to be caught by Keane, who also threw a boot out.",
      "It appeared as though United had a great shout for a spot-kick but replays showed that Keane got a slight touch on the ball before catching Mbeumo.",
      "After a memorable international fortnight where he extended his record-breaking run without conceding a goal for England, Everton stopper Jordan Pickford was at it again. The stopper produced a host of impressive stops to keep United at bay.",
      "The most spectacular save of Pickford's showreel at Old Trafford came as he denied Bruno Fernandes from range. He then made a couple of brilliant stops to tip away goal-bound headers from Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "It was an impressive showing from the former Sunderland man and was more than worthy of seeing him end the evening on the winning side.",
      "Handed his first Premier League start of the season in the absences of both Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, Monday's clash against Everton was a real chance for Joshua Zirkzee to get his United career back on track.",
      "But the Dutch forward really struggled to make an impression. He was not enough of a threat going forwards, allowing for one brilliant header, while he was also extremely sloppy on the ball.",
      "He eventually ended up playing the entire game, but that was more out of necessity than choice. As it stands, Zirkzee looks far from the solution for the Red Devils in attack",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jamie Carragher believes referee Tony Harrington could have 'managed the situation' leading up to Idrissa Gueye's bizarre red card, after the Everton star was sent off for slapping his own teammate against Manchester United.",
      "Gueye was shown his marching orders in the 13th minute at Old Trafford following a skirmish with Michael Keane. The Senegal international appeared to be unhappy with centre-back Keane after a miscommunication which led to the midfielder giving the ball away inside his own half.",
      "After words were exchanged, the pair came to head-to-head inside the 18-yard box before Gueye raised his right arm and looked to then slap Keane right on the side of his face. Once Gueye made contact with Keane's face, Harrington was in no hesitation but to give him a straight red card.",
      "\"Could you just get the two of them together and say 'eh, behave yourselves'. Sort of manage the situation rather than say 'that's the rule book, I am just going off exactly that. When you actually look at the rules it actually gives the referee a bit of an out.\"",
      "Ex-Everton manager Roberto Martinez also commented on the incident, saying: \"No I was very surprised because you need to be intense. You need to be intense. The reaction here, you've got a lot of bodies in the box.",
      "\"Obviously it's a bit of a misunderstanding [Gueye trying to play the ball to Keane and they blame each other]. Clearly it's a misunderstanding, Gueye is trying to play the ball but it's that reaction here, that slap, open hand.",
      "\"We've been talking about it many times. I think the referee has no other choice. When you see it there, the law tells you any aggression above the neck is a red card.\"",
      "Speaking just moments after Gueye was sent off, Neville said on co-commentary: \"It's a coming together between him and Michael Keane. It always looks unsavoury when it's teammate on teammate.",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",

      "Everton are set to be without Idrissa Gueye for some time following his strange red card against Manchester United. The Toffees' midfielder was shown a straight red card after slapping teammate Michael Keane during a disagreement on the pitch, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford having to get in between the two.",
      "The referee saw the incident and quickly brandished the red card to Gueye. VAR checked the decision and agreed with the red card.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre official X account explained: \"The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",
      "\"Idrissa Gueye has gone over to Keane - he hasn't really reacted. He just pushes him, and then there's not much in it. There's not much in it. I mean, I think Jordan Pickford does a very good job [breaking it up] to be fair to him.\"",
      "The red card won't only see Gueye miss the remainder of Everton's match against United. Being sent off for violent conduct means that he will also face a three-game ban.",
      "He will therefore miss Premier League games against Newcastle (H), Bournemouth (A) and Nottingham Forest (H). The midfielder is also likely to receive a fine from the FA and possibly even his own club.",
      "The ban means that Gueye is not going to be available for Everton very much over the next couple of months. The suspension means that he could make a comeback against Chelsea on 13 December.",
      "However, his participation in the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal means that he could again be unavailable until mid-January when the tournament finishes.",
      "The competition starts on Sunday, 21 December, meaning that he is unlikely to be unavailable for Everton for their Premier League clash against Arsenal on Saturday, 20 December - and could even miss the clash against Chelsea the week before, depending on when he heads to Morocco.",
      "Despite the player disadvantage, Everton took the lead in the first half through summer signing Kieran Dewsbury-Hall. The midfielder put the ball into the net in the 29th minute giving Everton something to hold on to.",

The 25-year-old returned to the starting XI for Los Verdiblancos after the November international break, as his team faced Girona in a La Liga encounter.",
      "Girona grabbed a shock opener through Vladyslav Vanat, before Real Betis levelled matters through Valentin Gomez, with both sides pushing for a decisive goal. That crucial second goal remained out of reach, despite the hosts' relentless efforts, which proved overzealous at times; Antony's determination ultimately led to a sending-off.",
      "The Brazilian attempted an overhead kick to control the ball, but inadvertently caught Joel Roca in the face, an incident that was reviewed and punished following a VAR check.",
      "He later shared a message on his Instagram story, which was translated from Spanish, stating: \"Very sad about the red card! All I wanted was to help my team win!\".",
      "\"A completely unintentional play. Sorry to all the fans who have always supported me!\"",
      "Antony now faces a period on the sidelines as he completes his ban for the dismissal, casting a shadow over what has otherwise been an encouraging beginning to his permanent spell with Real Betis.",
      "This season, the 25-year-old has registered four goals and one assist across nine La Liga matches, adapting well to a new league setting.",
      "That scenario nearly played out differently, though, with Antony revealing that Bayern Munich had held discussions about a potential transfer during the summer window, after the German giants struggled to secure attacking reinforcements.",
      "Whilst this caught many off guard, Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund recently confirmed to Sky Germany: \"This period wasn't exactly quiet. A lot happened. We were involved with several players, Antony was one of them.",
      "\"There was also a conversation, but that is in the past. We are very happy with how the squad is currently set up. In the end, at the close of the transfer window, we came out well and are satisfied.\"",

There are now signs of progress under Ruben Amorim this campaign, and the upcoming transfer windows could prove crucial in helping United advance further.",

      "Jamie Carragher says he would be willing to ask tough questions of Arne Slot amid Liverpool's current malaise after it was pointed out he did so with the former Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag - if his old club wished to do so.",
      "The Reds are in the grips of an ongoing crisis which has seen the defence of their Premier League crown fall apart. Saturday’s 3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest at Anfield was already Liverpool’s sixth of the season, which leaves them 11th in the table and already 11 points behind leaders Arsenal. That run of form has seen the pressure crank up on Slot.",
      "“ETH first two games had gone horribly wrong so the idea was to help him by speaking to us about football. We asked tough questions so it didn’t look like what it was, a set up!!”",
      "Fans are not the only one to have taken aim at both Carragher and Neville amid Liverpool’s ongoing crisis. Former Man United star Rio Ferdinand has recently suggested that they too have gone slightly easy on Slot in comparison to Ruben Amorim - the Portuguese having found himself under serious pressure earlier this season.",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Ferdinand said: \"I'II send them [Carragher and Neville] a message, I'll text them. They had [asked] Amorim straightaway [about the formation not working] when he weren't winning a few games.",
      "“I'd like to see the same energy for Arne Slot right now please. It's the worst start Liverpool have had to a season since Brendan Rodgers was sacked.\"",
      "Liverpool will be aiming to finally get back on track this week across a busy couple of fixtures. The Reds take on PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek ahead of next weekend’s clash against West Ham at the London Stadium.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid Shea Lacey is poised to make his mark on the first team in the coming weeks. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will soon jet off for the Africa Cup of Nations, meaning opportunities are up for grabs.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his attacking line-up, and the 18-year-old winger could make his senior debut for the club he has supported since childhood. Even before he started knocking on the door of the first team, Lacey had already amassed a significant following on social media.",
      "As he ascended through the academy ranks, his performances caught the eye of many online, with clips of his standout moments frequently going viral. Lacey, who once outshone Lamine Yamal to clinch a player of the tournament award in his youth, got his first taste of senior football over the summer.",
      "He joined Amorim's squad for a post-season tour of Asia, impressing enough to earn a spot in the United pre-season squad. His progress has reportedly excited many within the club.",
      "As the new Premier League season kicked off, Lacey returned to the Under-21s, where he has since netted three goals and provided two assists in nine outings. With Mbeumo and Amad due to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations next month, a senior debut for the youngster is on the horizon.",
      "Amorim may even include Lacey in the United squad for Monday night's showdown with Everton at Old Trafford. The Portuguese boss has previously voiced his belief in the teenager, stating he's ready to 'step up'.",
      "Looking ahead to the Reds' meeting with David Moyes' team, Amorim addressed how he plans to cope with the loss of Amad and Mbeumo over the coming weeks. He said: \"I think it is going to be hard, but then, that is the good thing of the experience.",
      "\"We lived so many limitations last year. We changed in January, and we didn't bring the players, then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things. We are prepared for that. It will be hard for us, but we have different baggage to deal with that.",
      "\"Guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea [Lacey], they can step up. We can send, at the same time, a message to everyone here in the academy that this is the future. But we are going to struggle, and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Speaking about the academy setup, Amorim continued: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy; they are preparing the academy. We are paying more attention to them; we are talking with them. That is so important to change information about the players, what they need, and how they behave.",
      "\"To call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are trying to do that. We are putting everything in place; nutrition is for the academy, and it starts now. In our club, that is something that should be basic.",
      "\"So, all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job. I have more time with them in training, so I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but they will struggle less, I think. Everyone in the Academy is doing very well in the moment.\"",
      "Lacey has the same talent management agency that represents Wayne Rooney. And the United legend is more than aware of the teenager's potential, having called him earlier this year to say: \"You're doing brilliant, keep doing what you're doing.\"",
      "The teenager has trained with England at St. George's Park this autumn. When pressed on Lacey's development, Amorim claimed he is delighted with his progress.",
      "\"I'm really happy with him, I think he struggled a little bit with injuries,\" said the United boss. \"He did a very good job balancing his body. You can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training sessions are hard, but Premier League games with pressure are harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

The Red Devils have had a mixed start to the season, including a shocking defeat in the League Cup to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "They'll be looking to continue their recent improved form on Monday night. United will take on Everton at Old Trafford in the 8pm kick-off, knowing that a win will take them up to fifth place.",
      "Amorim's team are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games, but they've had to settle for draws in their last two. The United manager was heavily backed with a net spend of around £170million this summer.",
      "It saw the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko touch down at the club. Despite that investment, Gullit believes that a lack of quality within the squad is one of Amorim's biggest challenges.",
      "\"I think it's always very difficult to get into a team halfway through the season. He did. So then you have half a season on and off,\" he exclusively said, via videogamer.com.",
      "\"Then he's been able to start a season with his own team and everything. But they still have some problems.",

      "\"And so they have to deal with players that play already at their highest level. Can they do more? Not everyone. That's the difficulty, he has to do it with the players that he has.\"",
      "With the January transfer window now fast approaching, plans will be being put into place for any activity that happens at Old Trafford. United have already been linked with several possible incomings with concentration on their midfield.",
      "The club made an approach to Brighton for Carlos Baleba back in the summer. They have also been linked with an interest in England duo Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson.",
      "Talking about if signing a new midfielder in the January window is a priority, Amorim said: \"It's hard to say that, but we can add in the future.",
      "\"But I don't know when, different characteristics, the same thing that our thinking in front, sometimes it's not the quality of the players, it's the characteristics of the players and we can improve in some areas in our club.",

      "Premier League clubs will be keeping a close eye on Vinicius Jr’s future after the player made it clear to Real Madrid that he will not consider signing a contract extension as things stand.",
      "The Brazilian winger has become a superstar at the Bernabeu following his arrival from Flamengo. But he could consider a move AWAY from the Bernabeu in the near future, with his relationship with new Real Madrid boss, Xabi Alonso, understood to be frosty.",
      "Vinicius, 25, was left furious after being taken off against Barcelona in the Clasico last month. And while he made a public apology to his teammates and supporters in the immediate aftermath, it does not appear to have repaired his relationship with the Los Blancos chief.",
      "According to The Athletic, Vinicius will not sign an extended contract with the club at this moment in time given his relationship with Alonso. The winger’s current deal runs until the summer of 2027, meaning Real could lose him for free in just 18 months.",
      "It is suggested that Vinicius made his feelings known in a meeting with club president Fiorentino Perez last month following his outburst during the Clasico. During his angry reaction to his substitution, the Brazilian was heard saying: “Always me, I’m leaving the team, it’s better if I leave, I’m leaving.”",
      "Vinicius penned a long apology on social media, albeit leaving Alonso out. Asked about that fact, the Real Madrid boss said: “Has Vinicius apologised to me? We had a meeting with everyone on Wednesday, and Vinicius was impeccable.",
      "“He spoke honestly and was very good. For me, that settles the matter. It was a very valuable, very positive statement. He demonstrated his honesty; he spoke from the heart.",
      "“What he said was the most important thing, and I was very satisfied. I've already said it, I was very proud and the matter was settled on Wednesday itself.”",
      "Should Vinicius angle to leave the club, a clutch of Premier League clubs will no doubt sit up and notice. Liverpool have been linked with a move for the winger in the past, while Manchester United have also been credited with a historical interest.",
      "Vinicius has so far scored 111 goals in 340 appearances for the Spanish side - five of those having come so far this season. Real Madrid are back in action on Wednesday as they take on Greek side Olympiacos on Wednesday ahead of a La Liga showdown with Girona.",

      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and struggled to find three points after Amorim was appointed a year ago. As the Portuguese coach looked for answers to help turn around the club's form, Obi was afforded a number of opportunities.",
      "The Danish forward was signed from Premier League rivals Arsenal and hit the ground running in the youth ranks, bagging 12 goals in 10 outings for the under-18s. He also fired in six goals in 16 appearances for the under-21s.",
      "That saw Obi earn first-team recognition as he made eight appearances under Amorim. The striker has not appeared since the final day of last season against Fulham, however.",
      "Amorim believes he did not foster the correct environment for Obi to thrive last term. “He played last year, but I think it was too soon,\" he said.",
      "“We didn’t have a team we could put a young kid of 16 into and him not struggle.",

      "The Utrecht player spent 11 years at United and became the first British South Asian to represent Manchester United. Iqbal was eligible to represent England, Pakistan and Iraq before plumping for the latter.",
      "The Manchester-born star made his first-team debut in December 2021 in the Champions League against Young Boys, under Ralf Rangnick. Iqbal's progress stalled under Erik ten Hag, however.",
      "The prospect was once subject to a foul-mouthed outburst from manager Ten Hag after being singled out during a training session by the Dutchman. The United boss was filmed screaming: \"Keep the ball on the floor... Zidane! Hey! Keep the ball! F***ing rubbish!\"",
      "Iqbal does not believe he was offered a fair chance by Ten Hag. That saw him look for a move away.",

      "After months of progress at Barcelona, Marcus Rashford was dealt a rough hand this week. That's after the Manchester United loanee was forced to watch from the sidelines as the rest of his team-mates in Catalonia made history.",
      "Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim is hard at work preparing for a January transfer window that could be transformative for the club. The Red Devils are finally on the rise this season, and much of that has been down to the squad improvements made in the summer.",
      "Saturday marked a special day in Barcelona's calendar after the club finally made its return to the renovated Camp Nou after two years away. The Blaugrana battered Athletic Club 4-0 in the first fixture to be played at the remodelled stadium, but Rashford was nowhere to be seen.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford will miss today's match against Athletic Club due to flu,\" read an official club statement. And the news excluded Rashford from being part of the historic unveiling of Barca's new-and-improved venue.",
      "Rashford had previously communicated his ambitions to play in the upgraded Camp Nou once it was open for business. Speaking at an open training session earlier in November, he said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I can't wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The silver lining is Rashford will still get his chance to be a part of Barca's line-up when they welcome their first capacity crowd at the Camp Nou. Saturday's game was played in front of a crowd of only around 45,000, with some renovation work still ongoing.",
      "When the work is complete and the stadium is fully up and running, it's expected to house up to around 105,000 fans. And given Rashford's impact under Hansi Flick so far this season, one would imagine he'll be one of the first names on the team sheet provided he's fit when that occasion comes around.",
      "One target being touted for a move to Old Trafford of late is Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi. However, United's chances of landing the German have taken a knock after it was reported he'd prefer to join Arsenal instead.",
      "Despite a complete overhaul of their attacking line-up in the summer, the Red Devils are being linked with more forward reinforcements in 2026. And Adeyemi looks like a realistic target after it emerged talks over a new Dortmund deal are understood to have stalled.",
      "The 23-year-old winger's current contract runs until the summer of 2027, meaning Dortmund will be expected to accept a lower fee for his services. However, that hasn't prevented reports suggesting the Black and Yellows want £75million for their man, which is believed to be more than United are willing to pay.",
      "That could give Arsenal the opening they need to swoop in should they decide they see more value in his signature. On the plus side, United share a largely positive relationship with Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes, who has helped execute the signings of clients like Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte in recent years.",
      "The supposed £75m price-tag becomes that much more difficult to justify considering Adeyemi has fallen somewhat out of favour under Niko Kovac. The attacker was an automatic starter for much of the first half of this season but has been benched for their last three Bundesliga games, scoring just four times in 15 games across all competitions this term.",

      "As the dust settles on Sunday afternoon’s north London derby against Tottenham, Arsenal turn their focus towards a busy week. There will be no respite for Mikel Arteta or his players as the Premier League leaders take on Bayern Munich next in Wednesday’s Champions League fixture.",
      "That will be followed by a crucial league visit to Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Gunners manager and sporting director Andrea Berta will have one eye on the transfer market, with just over a month left until the January window opens.",
      "We now take a look at two news stories that have emerged in the past few days which might determine how the north Londoners act in the coming transfer windows.",
      "Arsenal’s desire to upgrade in the left wing position in the summer was no secret. Antoine Semenyo’s incredible form over the past two seasons, along with his openness about being an Arsenal fan, has seen the Gunners linked with the Bournemouth sensation in recent months.",
      "But it is highly unlikely that Arsenal will pull off a transfer for the Ghanaian, who is said to have a £65million release clause in his contract. Although the Gunners remain compliant with PSR rules, they are believed to be sailing close to the wind where UEFA Squad Cost rules are concerned after their record-breaking summer spending spree.",
      "It is therefore understood that, barring any major sale on their part, January is set to be a quiet month in terms of transfer business in N5. That’s especially the case given that Arteta’s side have made a strong start to the season, with an abundance of depth at the Spaniard’s disposal.",
      "Should Semenyo stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the campaign, when his release clause will decrease, Arsenal could change their position, particularly if Gabriel Martinelli is offloaded. But the 25-year-old Bournemouth star is already being linked with several rivals, including Liverpool and Tottenham, which means bringing him to the Emirates Stadium could be a huge challenge.",
      "Another player Arteta is known to be a big fan of is Juventus’ Kenan Yildiz. Berta has been keeping track of the Turkey international’s situation in Turin, although that is standard practice rather than a major development.",
      "Yildiz, capable of playing as a left winger or as a central attacking midfielder, is still in contract talks with Juventus over a potential pay-rise, with the Serie A giants believing the 20-year-old deserves a more lucrative pay package.",
      "Yet, their negotiations are still ongoing after several months, with a positive outcome yet to be reached. Juve’s sporting director Giorgio Chiellini has maintained that the club are relaxed about the situation, with Yildiz being under contract until June 2029.",
      "Sources close to Yildiz have confirmed there has been informal contact from a number of Premier League clubs in the past six months to gain an understanding of the Turk's situation. But, even if Juventus are unable to agree a new deal with the player, the ex-Bayern Munich youth sensation is expected to command a premium fee.",
      "Manchester United were among the clubs considering a move for Yildiz earlier this year, before eventually signing Matheus Cunha in the summer. Chelsea and Real Madrid could also compete with Arsenal for his signature given their interest in the player.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have NOT made an approach for Joao Gomes, according to Wolves boss Rob Edwards. The Brazilian features on the Red Devils’ shortlist as they target an overhaul of their midfield under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He features alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid. With the transfer window just over a month away, United are expected to ramp up their efforts of signing a new midfielder soon.",
      "But as it stands, the Red Devils are yet to make an official approach to Wolves over Gomes. Speaking ahead of his side’s 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace, boss Edwards said: \"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised.",
      "“We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "One man who would be a big fan of Gomes moving to Old Trafford is his former Wolves teammate Matheus Cunha. The forward has compared Gomes to current Red Devils star Casemiro amid glowing praise.",
      "He said: \"He is a bit older now but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Gomes, 24, joined Wolves from Brazilian side Flamengo in 2023 and he has gone on to make 104 appearances for the side since then, scoring seven goals. He only signed a new deal with Wolves earlier this year, that contract set to run until 2030, but it is thought that an offer in the region of around £44m might be enough to facilitate an exit.",
      "Gomes remains far from the only option for United in their task to sign a new midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Anderson is a priority target - albeit his £100m price tag could present the Red Devils with a significant issue.",
      "Speaking about potential interest in his star midfielder, Forest boss Dyche said: “It is nothing to do with me, it is the powers that be. They run the club and the financial side. I’m sure they will ask my opinion about the situation, if it is needed - not just about him but about all the players here.”",

      "Despite the early sending off, Everton were the better side and deserved to draw first blood through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who beat Senne Lammens from the edge of the box. United pushed for an equaliser but couldn't find a breakthrough as Jordan Pickford denied Joshua Zirkzee with an excellent late save.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Should have done better for Dewsbury-Hall's strike. His starting position made it difficult for him to get across to his left-hand side. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Didn't commit to the challenge when Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball on the edge of the box, which proved costly. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Was caught out of position a few times when Everton looked dangerous in the first half. Didn't have much to do after the break when United finally started to ask a few questions. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Tried his best. 5",

      "Any hope this would change the game in Ruben Amorim's favour was soon ended when on the half hour mark Everton led. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall roamed forward before unleashing a fierce effort into the top corner.",

      "Cunha has picked up a knock and has missed out on the matchday squad. His absence opens the door for Zirkzee to start. He has played just 90 minutes over five league matches for the Reds this season but Amorim is confident he and his teammates are ready to deal with the changes.",
      "Defeats for Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur over the weekend have opened the door to the top four. Should United win, they will be at least fifth but a comfortable victory would move them ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference.",
      "In terms of the other team news, it is more positive for Kobbie Mainoo, who did not travel to Spurs due to a knock. He has been deemed fit enough for a place on the bench after returning to training over the weekend. Harry Maguire does miss out after coming off injured against Spurs.",

      "Amorim praised Lacey at his pre-match press conference, saying: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "The forward received his maiden Under-20 call-up during the October international break. Lacey also received the opportunity to train with England's first-team at St. George's Park.",
      "In the last few years, footage of Lacey playing for United's academy has gone viral on social media and such clips have amassed thousands of views.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",
      "He has predominantly played on the right wing, but coaches in the academy like to challenge youngsters in different positions across the attack and Lacey is a versatile player.",

      "It's understood Mainoo has done everything he can to break into the team, even changing his private chef at home in an attempt to improve his game and working with private coaches during the international breaks, but his situation has not changed with the January window approaching.",
      "Amorim has explained Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start. Mainoo requested to leave on loan in the final week of the summer window and could look to leave again in January.",

Amorim was asked whether requests to leave from either player would be entertained, and he said: \"The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen.",

I don't know when, different characteristics, the same thing that our thinking in front, sometimes it is not the quality of the players, it is the characteristics of the players and we can improve in some areas in our club.",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Manuel Ugarte to improve in training sessions amid concerns about his performances for Manchester United this season. Ugarte got off to a mixed start in Manchester after his €50million (£42.3m) transfer, with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024.",
      "The midfielder was expected to improve after the appointment of Amorim. Ugarte played his best football under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, but he's been unable to reproduce those levels so far at Old Trafford. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions. Amorim was asked whether he was surprised by Ugarte's form and challenged him to improve. \"No, I understand. If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "\"So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "There has been speculation around Ugarte's future. Amorim was ruthless last summer, deciding Rasmus Hojlund should leave after a disappointing campaign. Benjamin Sesko has been sidelined with a knee injury, but Amorim does not regret allowing Hojlund to join Napoli.",
      "\"Our thinking is that we need two strikers,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer players that make two positions, because sometimes in these clubs it's hard to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say if Ben has an injury, you have more time to play. It's impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that's why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "\"If you have an injury, that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.\"",
      "Sesko picked up his knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim mentioned Manchester United youngsters Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher when he was asked how the team would cope with losing key players to the Africa Cup of Nations. Lacey and Fletcher took part in first-team training at Carrington on Friday morning, suggesting they have a chance of being named in the matchday squad when Everton visit Old Trafford.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was ruled out of facing Tottenham before the international break due to a knock, which opened the door for Fletcher to come into the first-team squad in London. Fletcher’s inclusion continued United's 88-year record of naming an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher's son has made progress since joining from Manchester City two years ago, and has acquitted himself well playing against senior opposition in the EFL Trophy and National League Cup. Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at a press conference on Friday. Speaking about losing players to AFCON, he said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Chido Obi made seven appearances in the Premier League last season, but the young striker has not been named in a senior squad so far this term. Obi has played for the Under-21s, developing away from the spotlight, and Amorim believes he was overexposed last term due to injuries.",
      "\"Yeah, of course, he played last year,\" Amorim said about whether Obi was someone who could step up. \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "Speaking about trusting young players, Amorim said: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy, they are preparing the academy, we are paying more attention to them, we are talking with them.",
      "\"Just that is so important for us, to change information about the players, what they need, how they behave, even to call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well, if you don't behave really well. This connection is really important, we are trying to do that, we are putting everything in place.",
      "\"Nutritionist for the academy starts now, in our club. That is something that should be basic, so all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job, so I have more times with them, with training.",
      "\"So I'm more confident with them, when we put these kids to play in Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think, so I think everyone in the academy, are doing a very good job in the moment.\"",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim could be forced to think outside of the box tonight as the Reds welcome Everton to Old Trafford. United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and after defeats for the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City this weekend, Amorim will be hopeful his side can close the gap on those at the top.",
      "If they are going to do that, they will need to manage without Benjamin Sesko. The centre-forward picked up a knee injury in the draw against Tottenham Hotspur and is out for a few weeks.",
      "Matheus Cunha could also be missing after he suffered a training ground knock. The Brazilian had been expected to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening but the organisers announced he had pulled out due to medical reasons.",
      "So with potentially two absentees in the forward line, we could see a new role for Bryan Mbeumo. The Cameroonian has played as a No.10 since moving to Old Trafford but in the potential absence of Cunha and Sesko, Amorim could be tempted to have Mbeumo leading the line for United.",
      "If this is the thinking, we can expect Mason Mount and Amad to play just behind him. Amad spent last season as the Reds' No.10 but has excelled in the right wing-back role this term.",
      "The Ivorian's main strength remains his ability to attack so reverting back to the No.10 role should be no hardship. Noussair Mazraoui remains a solid option to fill in while Amad is being utilised further up the pitch.",
      "On the left flank, it is a toss up between Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot. Dorgu was favoured in the draw at Spurs and we expect the same to happen again on Monday night.",
      "Dalot does not seem comfortable on the left and Dorgu is certainly the future in that role. The Dane impressed last week for his country and Amorim will hope he can utilise this form for United.",

After an awful start to the season, Ruben Amorim has overseen an impressive turnaround, and he picked up the manager of the month award for October after three wins on the bounce.",
      "United began November by drawing against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. The Reds salvaged a point against Spurs before the international break thanks to a headed added-time goal from Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Everton have made an indifferent start to the campaign and are struggling to score goals, but they secured a 2-0 victory against Fulham at the Hill Dickinson Stadium before the international break. They have only won once away from home all season - at Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Regarding the team news, Benjamin Sesko has been ruled out with a knee injury and Harry Maguire appeared to be ruled out after missing training on Friday. Kobbie Mainoo was expected to take part in training on Saturday after missing the session the day before.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up...",
      "The biggest team news headline was the update on Sesko, who picked up a knee injury against Tottenham last weekend. Sesko started on the bench against Spurs, which means Amorim can pick the same attack if he likes, but it makes sense to drop Amad to right wing-back and play Mount.",
      "Amad looked better when he was moved to that role at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Mount created two chances when he came on from the bench in the second half.",
      "Dorgu was recalled to the starting team in London and scored for Denmark during the break. There isn't much between Dalot and Dorgu because they've both been unconvincing, but I'd give the latter the nod.",
      "Doubts surrounding the fitness of Matheus Cunha will have raised alarm bells for United heading into this one. The Reds still have a few options in attack and could choose not to risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Bryan Mbeumo as the false nine will be a new role for him at Old Trafford but it is a position he has played before. This would allow Amad and Mount to play behind him and not risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Dorgu at left wing-back seems the most likely choice. Dalot is not comfortable on the left and the Dane's performance during the international break was good.",

      "The second Manchester derby of the season will take place on Saturday, January 17 at 12.30pm after the Premier League confirmed the latest fixtures to be moved for TV coverage.",
      "The Blues won the first derby of the season 3-0 at the Etihad, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden had got the ball rolling. That mid-September clash got City back on track after a shaky start to the season, but United have also improved under Ruben Amorim and they will expect to put up a better fight at Old Trafford.",
      "The last time a league fixture between the clubs was staged on a Saturday lunchtime came in January 2023, when United won 2-1. Jack Grealish gave City the lead before the hosts turned the game around in the final 12 minutes. Bruno Fernandes scored a controversial equaliser and Marcus Rashford bagged the winner.",

      "Manchester United have welcomed the announcement of the Greater Manchester growth plan unveiled by Andy Burnham, which has promised over £1billion worth of investment.",
      "The first-of-its-kind fund will involve more than 30 projects to be backed across the region. Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",
      "Burnham has outlined his vision for Greater Manchester to become “a second city to rival any other on the planet by 2050\" and every district to benefit from “regeneration at a pace and on a scale not seen before this century”.",
      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",
      "Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but sources confirmed last month United were \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "In an interview with the United We Stand magazine last year, Sir Jim Ratcliffe slammed the data department at Old Trafford. “Until we are as good as anyone in the world, then it’s not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s an immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "United announced the appointment of Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Ratcliffe discussed the importance of bringing in the \"right people\" and landed his prime target.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United confirmed that Sansoni would be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers in the summer window.",
      "In July, Sansoni said United had made \"meaningful progress\" with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\".",
      "He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re only just getting started.\"",
      "United's data-led review of 2024/2025 identified the attack as the priority area for strengthening, concluding the shortage of goals was the biggest factor in the team's underperformance.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens arrived in the second half of the summer transfer window. They were different signings to Cunha and Mbeumo, arriving with no Premier League experience, but the numbers were crunched on both players and United were happy to splash a combined £84.8million.",
      "The press release announcing Sesko's transfer noted that he had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.",
      "Jason Wilcox said: \"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at United.\"",
      "United sources pointed to Lammens' underlying statistics when he signed. They said the Belgium international had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe, with a post-shot expected goals of +14.5, and highlighted he had made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues.",
      "In layman's terms, post-shot expected goals look at how many goals more or less a goalkeeper has conceded than he's been expected to, based on the quality of shots they have faced. Lammens had essentially prevented 14 goals that an 'average' goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to stop.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.\"",
      "Sesko has scored just two goals since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but Ruben Amorim has backed him to succeed. On the other hand, Lammens has \"surprised\" Amorim with the extent of his impact.",
      "United's business in the summer window appears to be an improvement on previous years. How much the data is responsible for that is up for debate, but the club's data department, by all accounts, has improved. Sansoni has played a key role and he is currently recruiting staff.",
      "When Sansoni's appointment was communicated, United said further recruitment is planned for a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "Ratcliffe has been ruthless with his club-wide cuts. The employee count has been slashed significantly and every outgoing penny is now scrutinised, but the data department is not shrinking - it's growing.",
      "The United co-owner believes that investing in data can give United an edge, which will theoretically save millions of pounds in the long run. Just think how much has been wasted on transfer fees alone.",
      "United are in the process of hiring a data operations manager to join Sansoni's team to \"drive data and technology projects forward\". Sansoni has invited hopefuls who are passionate about data to get in touch.",
      "Sansoni is doing important work behind the scenes, impacting United's recruitment.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",
      "\"Then you have to look, to play in the Premier League nowadays, the physicality is something you cannot run from. You need to pay attention to that. Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",
      "\"And we had some issues in the past when we did that, and we got that wrong. And then the most important thing is talent and working hard. That is the things we are looking for from our players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu claimed Manchester United \"have enough good players\" when asked whether he would like to share a dressing room with Scott McTominay at Old Trafford after his wonderful goal against Denmark. The former United midfielder was sold in 2024 to Napoli - five months prior to Dorgu's United arrival - and since then he has been impressing in Serie A.",
      "This week the midfielder helped Scotland beat Dorgu's Denmark 4-2 at Hampden Park to secure the home nation's qualification to the World Cup in USA, Mexico and Canada. McTominay opened the scoring after less than five minutes with a tremendous overhead kick.",
      "United loanee Rasmus Hojlund scored from the penalty spot to level the game before Lawrence Shankland guided in a corner to give the Scots the advantage. Denmark only needed a point to qualify automatically and Dorgu's late strike looked to have earned them just that but two late goals saw them settle for a place in the play-offs.",
      "When asked post-match if he would like to be playing alongside McTominay at United, Dorgu said: \"It was a good goal but we also have enough good players at United as well. I am happy for him winning the league in Napoli.\"",
      "The next international break is not until March at which point Denmark will need to beat North Macedonia and then either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland to progress to the World Cup. Dorgu insists his focus is now on succeeding with the Reds until then.",
      "He said: \"100% we just need to look forward. We are in a really good position at United.",
      "\"We will go back with confidence to help the team to get more wins. Denmark is now March. It is a long time and we just need to concentrate on club matters until then.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Ruben Amorim has told wantaway players that “Manchester United comes first” but is retaining those players actually in the club’s best interests? Particularly if, as Amorim himself insists, “it’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that”.",
      "In a World Cup year both Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are very keen on loan moves in January. Mainoo is yet to start, making seven substitute appearances in the Premier League; Zirkzee has featured for just 82 minutes.",
      "Asked about their futures ahead of Monday night’s clash, Amorim was adamant that he wouldn’t consider their exits if it would hinder Manchester United.",
      "“The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen,” said Amorim.",
      "“I was a football player, I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation, so I don’t know what is going to happen.",
      "“I want my players to be happy. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing that the World Cup is there, and I know what it means for the World Cup, but Manchester United comes first. So if I can help the club and the players, I will be happy, if not I have to think about the team.”",
      "It’s up for debate whether Manchester United players who are not playing football is what’s best for the club, not least because their values will be plummeting ahead of next summer if – as looks very likely to be the case – they’re set to be sold as ill-fitting parts in Amorim’s system.",
      "And quite why Amorim has one rule for Rasmus Hojlund and an entirely different one in the cases of Mainoo and Zirkzee is unclear.",
      "Asked if the club made a mistake in allowing Hojlund to leave the club in the summer on the back of Benjamin Sesko’s injury, Amorim insisted him staying would have made the dressing room “impossible to manage”.",
      "He added: “Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say: ‘If Ben has an injury, you have more time to play’. It’s impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that’s why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "“If you have an injury that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.”",
      "Amorim also claimed Chido Obi was promoted “too soon” last season and the 17-year-old wasn’t named in the squad on Monday despite the injuries to Sesko, and Matheus Cunha, whose absence was all but confirmed by Visit Altrincham’s superb bombshell press release on Saturday evening.",
      "“Unfortunately Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.”",
      "United are two forwards down, as they will be again next month when Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo both leave for AFCON. And while Zirkzee and Mainoo’s game time has been limited in a season bereft of football owing to them not competing in Europe and being dumped out of the League Cup by Grimsby Town, the first real injury problem for United sees Zirkzee in the starting lineup.",
      "Given Amorim’s preference for using Mainoo further forward, the academy graduate will hope that no Mbuemo or Amad, and maybe others through injury, will see him play his part in the busy winter weeks, and perhaps stake his claim for more regular game time when they return.",
      "Whether or not that is the case, Amorim is absolutely right not to let these players leave the club, even if it is giving him an “impossible” dressing room to manage. Others do it relatively easily, mate.",
      "Daniel Farke is clear Sack Race favourite as Leeds slump into the bottom three, but Arne Slot is now second as the Liverpool collapse continues.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has admitted that one of his players is “struggling”, while he has opened the door to two transfers.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Benjamin Sesko’s injury is “not that serious” ahead of a busy December schedule.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made a Manchester United transfer ‘reveal’ that you, dear reader, will simply fail to ever believe. There might be no point even trying.",
      "We are pulling ourselves away from Jude Bellingham to look at an 11-man Manchester United ban and Liverpool transfer critics.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has hit back at critics of his formation after the Red Devils starting picking up results in recent weeks."

      "Tottenham are primed to launch a January assault for Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, but TEAMtalk understands that Manchester United could have a potential trump card in the race, while Liverpool are also poised to strike.",
      "Semenyo, 25, is set to be at the epicentre of a Premier League bidding frenzy. The 25-year-old, whose explosive start to the 2025-26 season has yielded six Premier League goals – trailing only Erling Haaland (14), Igor Thiago (9) and Danny Welbeck (7) – is the subject of serious interest, with approaches ‘imminent’, per sources.",
      "Tottenham, under Danish tactician Thomas Frank, are poised to act decisively. Frank, who once hailed Semenyo as Bournemouth’s “main threat” during his time at Brentford, is eager to elevate Spurs’ attacking firepower amid their goal-shy campaign.",
      "With Richarlison one goal behind Semenyo’s tally, insiders say Spurs are READY to match the £65million release clause in Semenyo’s contract, which activates in January but expires on a fixed date, allowing Bournemouth time to sign replacements.",
      "This clause, down from a £70million summer valuation, represents a bargain for a player whose counter-attacking prowess has terrorised defences.",
      "However, TEAMtalk understands that United’s interest has intensified, bolstered by an unlikely ally: Bournemouth technical director Simon Francis, a lifelong Red Devil.",
      "Francis is set to pitch Old Trafford’s vision to Semenyo, positioning United ahead of rivals despite their summer pivot to Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim views the versatile winger as the missing spark in a squad craving dynamism, with a bid in advanced planning stages…",
      "READ MORE 🔴 Liverpool journalist reveals if FSG are planning to sack Arne Slot whose ‘arrogance is killing’ Reds",
      "Despite the advances from Tottenham and United, as we have consistently reported, Liverpool are currently the favourites to lure Semenyo away from the Cherries.",
      "The Reds, frontrunners since Semenyo’s brace in their chaotic 4-2 opening-day opener at Anfield, remain undeterred.",
      "Arne Slot sees him as an upgrade and fresh energy in a struggling squad, fitting seamlessly into his high-pressing blueprint.",
      "Despite racist abuse endured by Semenyo at Anfield that night souring initial ties, sources confirm Liverpool will counter any advances, prioritizing Semenyo’s one-v-one mastery and ambidextrous finishing.",
      "Bournemouth, buoyed by sales of Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi without derailing progress, reluctantly brace for departure.",
      "Semenyo, content yet ambitious, hasn’t pushed for a move but welcomes elite suitors.",
      "Bristol City are also set to pocket 20 per cent of profits following his £10m move in 2023, so the Championship club will benefit financially when he moves.",
      "As the release clause looms, this saga could redefine mid-window dealings, with Semenyo’s 2024-25 haul of 11 goals and five assists underscoring his elite trajectory.",
      "Meanwhile, TEAMtalk transfer insider Dean Jones has revealed that Joao Gomes’ head has been turned by United’s interest in him. He wants to join in January.",
      "Wolves have told new manager Rob Edwards they’ll reject offers for Gomes, but in reality, a bid of £40m to £50m would be considered.",

      "“He always had a lot of interest, especially from Saudi Arabia. So, after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested.",
      "“At the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing is guaranteed in terms of a new contract because of the salary, so either they find a solution on the salary structure together otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Man Utd in summer 2026.”",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",

Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",

The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea.

It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. And it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost six in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 11-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "It has been argued that Liverpool may soon have no choice but to sack Arne Slot, while Jurgen Klopp has been backed to make a return to management.",
      "Thomas Frank lands in the losers alongside Arne Slot after his embarrassing five-word admission after defeat to the really quite ridiculously good Arsenal.",
      "The actual Premier League standings are damning enough on Liverpool, but these five tables highlight why the champions find themselves in the bottom half…",
      "Pep Guardiola said ‘now the real season starts’ for Manchester City before Newcastle – and it might already be over as Arsenal capitalised on their defeat.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has hatched a plan to ‘drop’ Ibrahima Konate from his starting XI for PSV on Wednesday night.",
      "Is it time to ask whether Alexander Isak is the biggest flop in Premier League history? It’s been a perfect storm of crud for Liverpool’s big-money signing."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "Lammens continues to dazzle United fans with simple competency. The Belgian made a couple of fine saves at Spurs and could do little to stop either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "A first clean sheet in seven sees Pickford climb here. The England keeper just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",

      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",

      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "Was one of the biggest climbers in recent weeks but conceded two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",
      "",
      "The Bournemouth keeper is a massive faller after conceding four at Villa from a PSxG of 2.3, and two to West Ham from 0.9. Callum Wilson’s opener was a terrible look on Petrovic.",

      "That has led United to send Sancho out on three different loan spells, first back to Dortmund, then to Chelsea, and now Aston Villa.",

      "Caught Offside write that Dortmund are keen to give Sancho a third spell at the club, but not so keen that they are willing to pay the winger anything like the kind of money he is said to be on at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho is reported to be on wages of £300,000 per week – twice the figure that Dortmund would be willing to pay him.",
      "The far greater riches available to Premier League clubs, and especially a massive club like Manchester United, enable them to pay significantly more than Dortmund would reasonably be able to offer.",
      "The Bundesliga side are also said to be unwilling to make an exception and break their wage structure to re-secure Sancho’s signature. That would leave Sancho either needing to take a biiiig old 50% pay cut.",

      "There’s also the fact that, let’s face it, Sancho’s stock is considerably lower now than it was  when he signed that lucrative contract at United, so he may well not get a better offer than whatever Dortmund put on the table.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "Brentford: Jordan Henderson\nWe concede that Henderson has been better than we expected (and hoped) on his return to the Premier League. But perhaps clouded by our great lily-livered lefty dislike of a man who moved to Saudi Arabia having been such a supposedly staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, we don’t hold pointing, shouting and playing a couple of long balls in quite such high regard as those who worship at the altar of the midfielder with an entirely broken moral compass.",

Edwards has made three substitute appearances totalling 21 minutes this season.",

      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",

      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",

      "West Ham: Lucas Paqueta\nWe are very intrigued by what might happen if Paqueta extricates himself from West Ham in 2026, as is suggested will be the case, because for every game in which he does something entirely out of keeping with the quality of the football club he currently plays for, there are half a dozen more where he looks as though he might have found his level.",

      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Monday 24 November 2025 19:58, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has emerged as Ruben Amorim's most important Manchester United player this season.",
      "A stalwart at the back, the central defender is the only player to have played every single minute of United's Premier League campaign so far this term.",
      "With Amorim a known tinkerman, not least during games, especially at centre-back, De Ligt's ever presence is a testament to his growing influence at Old Trafford.",
      "When De Ligt signed for United in August 2024, Old Trafford had acquired a then-24-year-old who had struggled to live up to the lofty billing of his early career.",
      "Having captained Ajax at 18, De Ligt was tipped to become one of the game's finest defenders. He became the first defender to win the Golden Boy in 2018, the trophy awarded to the best U21 player.",
      "That was before his starring role in the Champions League as Ajax famously reached the semi-final in 2019, where his displays in that campaign propelled his worth.",
      "A move to Juventus came next for the defender, with the world at his feet, and Bayern Munich also followed. However, despite a healthy trophy return in that period, the pace of his early development had slowed, and De Ligt had become an injury-prone disappointment.",
      "Now, it seems as though De Ligt has been living through a personal renaissance. At 26, things have started to come together for the Dutchman. He's often used as the right centre-back in Amorim's oft-discussed back three but is more than capable of filling in centrally.",
      "On the opening day, a colossal performance, despite defeat to Arsenal, saw De Ligt take care of Viktor Gyokeres in a showing that paved for things to come.",
      "In the league, his performances have sustained, standing as one of United's outstanding options at the back. Among defenders at the club, De Ligt leads the way for aerial duels won and interceptions.",
      "De Ligt is also among United's best tacklers and passers, factoring in defenders at the club. They are performances that have been rewarded with a recall into the Netherlands National team by boss Ronald Koeman.",
      "For the Dutchman, his upturn in form is a reflection of a growing maturity and fewer injuries.",
      "\"I'm 26 now and I'm entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" De Ligt told Dutch outlet NOS.",
      "\"I've changed my mindset. Initially, I didn't want to make mistakes; now I want to do as many good things as possible.'",
      "Asked about his form, De Ligt added: \"There are a few explanations for that. I've had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body.",
      "\"This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "De Ligt's goal to earn United a draw at Tottenham just before the international break felt like the culmination of months of assured displays. However, despite his history as a leader, De Ligt was not named in Amorim's leadership group.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui were put forward by Amorim as his group to oversee the dressing room at the beginning of the season.",
      "\"Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play,\" Amorim said following the draw at Spurs.",
      "\"Then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other.\"",
      "Amorim's growing reliance on De Ligt, may be a cause for the Portuguese coach to rethink his decision. However, despite De Ligt's form, Amorim believes we are yet to see the Dutchman at his flying best.",
      "\"He is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well,\" Amorim added after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball. That is a smart thing for a player.",
      "\"But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",
      "Amorim's words owe to his desire to one day see United be the dominant side when they are also the side dominating possession. By his own admission, currently, United are some way from that.",
      "However, with the in which he has established himself so far this season, the stalwart that is De Ligt may be the anchor of United's defensive plans going forward.",

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",

      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",
