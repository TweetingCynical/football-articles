      "Lisandro Martinez is poised to finally rejoin his team-mates in Manchester United training this week after his comeback was delayed slightly.",
      "Martinez has not played for United since being injured in a 2-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on February 2, 262 days ago. He has missed 35 United games in total since then with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and has been a significant miss for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Argentina international has been patiently working behind the scenes at the club’s Carrington training ground and is now near a significant milestone. United had hoped that Martinez would join Amorim’s first team group last week, but that ended up not being the case.",
      "United are keen to take a very cautious approach to reintegrating Martinez, aware that ACL injuries can be difficult. However, Martinez has been given the all clear on his knee, with scans showing that injury has fully healed and he is expected to now train with his team-mates for the first time in eight months.",
      "Martinez is a key player for United in central defence, where Amorim also has Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven as options. His eventual return will increase competition for places in the three-man defence, where Martinez was previously favoured.",
      "Casemiro summed up the feeling around his impending return in an interview with the club website last week. “Licha is on the final straight,” the United midfielder said. “He is a soldier who works so hard. He is always in the gym working hard. He is a machine that works so hard. He is one of those players that loves to work hard.",
      "“It is a pleasure to have him here, he works so much. We arrived [today] at 9am and it is now 4pm and he continues working. He has the experience to know when to work hard. I will be so glad for his return. It’s not just me, everyone is happy, because he is an essential player at the club that works so hard.”",
      "Martinez may have not been able to contribute in matches or on the training pitch, but he has still been around the group whenever possible. “We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him,” Amorim explained last month.",
      "“But he's always there in every meeting. In training, he sometimes finishes his and stays to watch the training. We need Licha in this team.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A sensational reunion between Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United could soon be on the horizon. Reports suggest the Red Devils are considering arranging a mid-season friendly against Ronaldo's current club, Al-Nassr, at some point over the coming months.",
      "The proposed fixture, set to take place in Saudi Arabia, would offer the Portuguese icon a fitting opportunity to bid farewell to United supporters after his second spell at Old Trafford ended on a sour note. Ronaldo returned to United in 2021 after 12 years away, but his contract was terminated little over a year later following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, during which he openly criticised both the club and manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Benni McCarthy, who served as Ten Hag's assistant at the time, has since insisted that despite the acrimonious nature of Ronaldo's departure, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner still deserves the chance to have a proper send-off from the fans.",
      "\"I think the manner that he left, it wasn't a fitting manner for such an unbelievable, world-class player of his stature,\" McCarthy told Best Betting Sites. \"So if that is the case that United get to play against Al Nassr, it will be a nice way for him as well to reconnect with the club that he's achieved so much with and the club that put him on the map in world football.",
      "\"It would [also] be a nice way for him to say goodbye to his team-mates. Because I know for a fact after that interview dropped he just left and we never saw him again.",
      "\"He never got to say goodbye to the players, to his team-mates and to the technical staff that was there. But this might give him a proper opportunity to reunite with the United faithful again. And the fans that will be there will give him a nice farewell, because that's what he deserves for what he's achieved at the club.\"",
      "Ronaldo's second spell at Manchester United began promisingly but his return coincided with a dip in form that ultimately cost manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. Although the Portuguese forward continued to find the net regularly, critics argued that his presence was tactically detrimental.",
      "He finished the season with an impressive 24 goals in all competitions, yet his efforts weren't enough to secure Champions League qualification for United. Over the summer, Ronaldo grew increasingly disillusioned with the club's direction and expressed his desire to leave.",
      "After missing much of United's pre-season in an attempt to engineer a move away, Ronaldo found himself on the fringes under new manager Ten Hag, often omitted from the starting line-up.",
      "In his interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo claimed he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and criticised United for becoming a shadow of the club they once were under Sir Alex Ferguson. His contract was terminated on the eve of the 2022 World Cup, after which he signed with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr.",
      "In the years since, Ronaldo has scored an astonishing 105 goals in 118 appearances, spearheading a footballing revolution in the Gulf nation. His arrival paved the way for a wave of high-profile stars to follow him to Saudi Arabia, transforming the league's global profile.",
      "Although Ronaldo's departure from United left a bitter aftertaste, he remains a beloved figure among the club's supporters - and the chance to see him grace the pitch against United one final time would surely be welcomed.",
      "The Red Devils have been looking at planning some money-spinning friendlies, which would also help fill the midweek void left after failing to qualify for European competition, with Al-Nassr emerging as potential opponents.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim has already expressed his enthusiasm for arranging such fixtures, raising the prospect of an emotional reunion between Ronaldo and his former club. \"We have to do it. And you know, we knew that when we missed out on Europe, we have a lot of things to do,\" he said.",
      "\"We have our fans, we have the budget, we have to to compensate for a lot of things. So we have to do it. We will do it. We want to be with our fans around the world. If you have to do it, you have to manage to find the space to do it.\"",

      "Ex-Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has sung the praises of new Manchester United shot-stopper Senne Lammens and insists he won't crumble under pressure if he commits a costly error. Lammens has hit the ground running and made a huge impression since his £18.2million summer move.",
      "The Belgian joined United on deadline day, signing a five-year contract, and his since established himself as the club's No 1 keeper. The 23-year-old is considered among Europe's most promising young keepers and has already made his mark during his initial period at M16.",
      "Lammens secured a clean sheet on his United bow against Sunderland before delivering another assured display in Sunday's 2-1 triumph over reigning Premier League champions Liverpool. United's decision to sign a new goalkeeper represents a U-turn from previous comments made by Ruben Amorim, who insisted that he would be sticking with Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır.",
      "That decision has already paid dividends with Lammens earning widespread praise for his early performances. And if Mignolet's comments are anything to go by, United have got themselves a much more dependable keeper between the sticks than they've had in years.",
      "Speaking about the Belgian, Mignolet offered his assessment on what makes his fellow countryman so exceptional, having shared the pitch with him at Club Brugge in Belgium's top flight.",
      "\"He has the build and the qualities to succeed in England. He's big, explosive, and strong on high balls. And he can save balls that other goalkeepers can't,\" Mignolet said, via Voetbal Primeur.",
      "\"With his shot-stopping, he can score points for United. He's steady in his head and handles pressure well.\"",
      "Crucially for United supporters - and something that will undoubtedly be music to their ears - Mignolet disclosed that Lammens possesses the mental fortitude to recover from setbacks, something previous keeper Onana struggled with. Mignolet added: \"He has the ability to bounce back after a mistake and stay calm.\"",
      "United's goalkeeping woes have been a persistent headache for some time, but Lammens's promising early displays will provide massive hope for Red Devils supporters following the tribulations of Onana and Bayındır. Onana was ultimately loaned out to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor for the season after a series of costly blunders.",
      "Former United skipper Gary Neville has previously voiced his conviction that the Red Devils require shot-stoppers with a commanding presence and strong mentality.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position.\"",
      "Lammens seems to possess these qualities, judging by testimonials from Mignolet and other former colleagues.",
      "Former Fulham defender Denis Odoi, who witnessed Lammens's abilities firsthand at both Club Brugge and Antwerp, has outlined why the promising keeper could match the template Neville has demanded at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Senne is rather introverted, even in the dressing room. He's not very exuberant. That calmness is typical of his personality,\" he said.",
      "\"He's very conscientious. He really does everything he can to make sure he can't blame himself for anything.",
      "\"Sometimes we'd come back from a match against Club Brugge at 1 a.m. and he'd still be in the gym. Because he hadn't played as a second-choice goalkeeper, he wanted to get some work done.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has revealed the opportunity to feature in El Clasico against Real Madrid was among the key factors behind his summer switch to Barcelona. The striker secured a loan move to the Catalan club from Manchester United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona have an option to make the arrangement permanent next year for a fee of £26 million. Rashford continued his impressive form as he netted twice in his team's commanding 6-1 Champions League victory over Olympiacos on Tuesday night.",
      "Next up for Barca is a showdown with arch-rivals Real at the Santiago Bernabeu this Sunday. And it is match that Rashford is eagerly anticipating.",
      "\"The Clasico is a great game and that's why I've come here for this number of games,\" he said. \"I am looking forward to it, I hope we win.\"",
      "Despite previously insisting that his optimal role is out wide on the left flank, he thrived in a more central striking position against the Greek outfit. And following Tuesday night's win, Rashford confessed: \"It could be my best performance with Barca.",
      "\"I'm ready to bring out the best in me in the team. I prefer to play on the wing, but I don't care. I intend to help and do the best I can.\"",
      "The remarks follow Barcelona manager Hansi Flick's endorsement of Rashford's capabilities in a central role. \"Marcus can be a No.9 or a No.11, he told TNT Sport.",
      "\"When we think of him, we value the fact that he can play in more than one position. He has given us a lot of positives and, of course, he can play as a centre forward.\"",
      "An injury to Ferran Torres resulted in Rashford being deployed centrally against Olympiacos. However, Torres' return to fitness means he could be shifted back to a wide position for this weekend's Clasico.",

The 23-year-old progressed through the academies of Czech sides Boskovice and Zbrojovka Brno before signing for Atalanta in 2017.",
      "After impressing with the Italian side's Primavera and Under-17s, Vorlický made his professional debut in a 2-1 Serie A defeat to Lecce in February 2023. He played a further seven minutes across the next two games against AC Milan and Udinese before suffering a serious knee injury.",
      "Not long after that, he moved back to the Czech Republic with Slavia Prague, while the likes of Amad and Dejan Kulusevski joined Europe's top teams. United paid £19million for Amad when he was 18, in October 2020, with him joining the club under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2021.",
      "After loan spells with Rangers and Sunderland, the Ivory Coast star is now a key member of Ruben Amorim's side. Kulusevski was snapped up by Juventus in 2020 after being awarded the Serie A Best Young Player of the Season.",
      "Two years later, the Sweden international joined Tottenham on an 18-month loan, before that switch was made permanent. Both players, when fit, are regulars in the Premier League for their sides.",
      "In total, Vorlický endured five knee surgeries in seven years during his spell at Atalanta. Since returning to Prague, he has only managed 14 games for the first-team, and an additional 10 for their B side, with injuries further limiting his availability.",
      "Speaking with the Czech newspaper DNES, Vorlický has opened up about his terrible luck and how he believes he could have joined Amad and Kulusevski at United or Tottenham. \"I don't want this to sound cocky, but yes,\" he said when asked if he could play at the same level as the pair.",
      "\"People have been telling me since I was a child that I could grow up and to be a great footballer. Even more so at Atalanta, because everyone at the club believed in me.",
      "\"But I was also always aware that I was a boy from Boskovice who used to go to the gravel pitch with his friends after school to kick a ball.\" Asked if he blames previous doctors for his unfortunate injuries, he added: \"Why? He's only human.",
      "\"He operated on ten people that day, I got bad luck, that happens, I can't change it. Who knows what would have happened if I had been healthy? I'm humanly happy. Would I have been the same if I had continued? I have no idea. I'm just sorry that I didn't play.\"",

He finished twice into the near post to wrongfoot goalkeeper Konstantinos Tzolakis to ensure three points in the Champions League for his new club.",

      "He is only on loan until the end of the season, but has not tried to hide his happiness at being in Catalonia or at his desire to stay in the long term. Barca have the option to make his move permanent for around €30million (£26m) and Flick’s post-match comments hinted they might just do so.",
      "“For me, Rashford is performing very well and is an important player for the team. He won a penalty, which I thought was a penalty, and scored two goals,” Flick said. “He’s very fast, combines very well, and as he gains confidence, he will become more important.”",
      "Rashford has generally played off the left wing in recent years, but took the central role on Tuesday night, with Lamine Yamal on the right, Fermin Lopez in the No.10 position and youngster Dro Fernandez on the left wing. Yamal converted the penalty won by Rashford, while Lopez netted a hat-trick.",
      "“Rashford played well today,\" Flick added. “It's not easy for him to play that number nine role. The first minutes of the match I guess we were struggling to press, but at the end the chances he had and the penalty he won...",

      "The centre-half scored the winning goal at Anfield on Sunday to end his side's decade-long wait for a win on the red half of Merseyside. It isn't the first time Maguire has come up with big goals over recent seasons - one of those being on the European stage.",
      "United enjoyed a stunning comeback in last season's Europa League quarter-final as they scored three times in seven minutes to beat Lyon at Old Trafford. It was Maguire who headed home in the final minute of extra-time to set off jubilant scenes in Manchester.",
      "The Europa League's Twitter page put out the video and referenced how Maguire was renowned for scoring \"clutch headers\" in the aftermath of his Liverpool exploits.",
      "But the post was somewhat hijacked when it was reposted by Sevilla, who included another video of European action that saw Maguire head into his own net when the Spanish side rescued a game at Old Trafford, drawing 2-2 after they had trailed by two goals.",
      "That was back in Erik ten Hag's time at the club but proved to be a crushing blow. United looked to be cruising to a first-leg win in the knockout stages of the tournament, only for the La Liga outfit to score twice late on thanks to a brace of own goals to ensure parity ahead of the second-leg.",
      "The Spanish side enjoyed a triumphant 3-0 victory back on their own patch to send United packing from Europe. Sevilla were gifted the lead after eight minutes when Youssef En-Nesyri finished following an error from Maguire.",
      "There was talk of Ten Hag looking to offload Maguire during his time in Manchester, but the defender remained and has continued to underline his importance. Ruben Amorim has continued to make use of the England international with his biggest contribution coming on Sunday.",
      "Maguire's future in Manchester remains unclear with the centre-half into the final year of his contract - and no formal offer yet made to the 32-year-old. If the club want to retain the England international they will have to offer him fresh terms.",
      "Given he is now in the final eight months of his deal he could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January 1. The Daily Mail report that regular discussions continue between the club and the player but a decision from the hierarchy is yet to be made.",

      "Barcelona were already two goals up by half-time thanks to Fermin Lopez's brace. Any hopes of an Olympiacos comeback were dashed when they were controversially reduced to ten men in the 57th minute.",
      "But Barcelona seized the opportunity, scoring four more times to secure a resounding 6-1 victory. Rashford played a key part in three of those, initially earning a penalty after being tripped by opposition goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis following a smart one-two with Fermin, which was converted by Lamine Yamal in the 68th minute.",
      "Just six minutes later, the England international found the back of the net himself with a sharp diagonal run and a low shot across the keeper into the far corner. He wasn’t done there, combining with Pedri on the edge of the box and firing a clinical shot off the inside of the near post in the 79th minute.",

Here, we examine what the Spanish press made of his all-round display - with one outlet even hinting the La Liga giants have finally replaced Lionel Messi's set-piece taking ability following his departure four years ago.",
      "Spanish publication Marca lavished praise on both Rashford and hat-trick hero Fermin, declaring: “They're two players who don't make much noise, but who always contribute something to the team.”",

The publication said: “He scored two goals practically without warning. One after a crisp finish inside the box and another with a short dribble and a shot at the far post.”",
      "Sport identified Rashford as a \"difference maker\" following the 6-1 drubbing, suggesting he could influence the upcoming El Clasico in similar fashion. It pointed out how impressive the Red Devils academy graduate was in the No.9 position, though he could return to his usual role as a winger against Real Madrid.",
      "The publication also praised his set-piece taking ability, saying he could finally fill the free-kick void left by Lionel Messi's departure in 2021. The outlet wrote: “The Englishman is taking free kicks and is getting closer and closer to scoring: posts, balls to the full-back that just miss... It's about time Barca saw someone score from a free kick, a deficit that has been dragging on since Leo Messi's painful departure. The Englishman also takes corners from the left and does so with extreme danger. In the Clasico, he could be a weapon to be reckoned with.”",
      "Manager Hansi Flick, meanwhile, was quoted as saying: “He's an important player and he gives what I expect of him. He's giving 100 percent and it's fantastic to have him. He's playing in different positions; as he gains confidence and gets to know his teammates, he'll get better.”",
      "Mundo Deportivo said: “Rashford in his role as No.9 scored a brace and continued his fine scoring streak.”",
      "The outlet also highlighted that while he wasn't quite as impactful as he was against Newcastle last month, he demonstrated his quality through his clinical finishing and link-up play, which earned Barca an important penalty to make it 3-1.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have issued an indefinite ban to a supporter who was caught on camera assaulting the fan who has gone viral for growing his hair.",
      "Frank Ilett, known as the United Strand, has picked up nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram, where he is documenting his hair-growing. Ilett has decided not to cut his hair until United win five matches in a row and is now over a year into the challenge.",
      "He was assaulted by a fellow United supporter at the club’s 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford on September 20 in an incident that went viral on social media. A fan was seen pulling Ilett’s hair before angrily abusing him as others came to his aid.",
      "Greater Manchester Police later confirmed they were investigating and United have now managed to identify the perpetrator. The Daily Mail reports that he has been banned indefinitely from Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking about the incident, Ilett said: “Yeah, it was a bit weird to be honest! I thought he was just joking to start with, but then he started yanking my hair and calling me an ‘attention-seeking c***’.",
      "“The whole day was full of hundreds of positive interactions yesterday and 99 per cent of all of the reactions to this challenge has been nice. But just a few people can ruin it! My intention with this challenge was never to highlight Man United’s flaws. It was always and always will be to spread humour and positivity to United fans in a difficult time.”",
      "It has now been 382 days since Ilett vowed not to cut his hair until United won five consecutive matches and there hasn’t been much to suggest the stunt is about to end. But United have given him hope of a hair cut by winning two in a row, beating Sunderland 2-0 and Liverpool 2-1.",
      "“We’ll see. We hope that we can give him that haircut,” Dalot said. If they do beat Brighton on Saturday then Nottingham Forest and Tottenham will decide the fate of Ilett’s bushy locks.",
      "Despite the attention he’s gained from the challenge, Ilett is desperate for United to pick up those wins. “Like I've said before, I never expected it to go on for so long, but I'm hopeful we can go on a good run soon and I, more than most... want these wins to come as soon as possible,” he said recently.",

      "Harry Maguire's Manchester United future remains unclear with the centre-half into the final year of his contract - and no formal offer yet made to the 32-year-old.",
      "United triggered the 12-month extension in the six-year, £190,000-a-week contract that Maguire had signed when he moved to Old Trafford from Leicester in 2019. If the club want to retain the England international they will have to offer him fresh terms.",
      "Maguire was their man of the moment on Sunday as he headed home the winner at Anfield - ending a near decade-long wait for a win at Liverpool. The defender remains a crucial figure for the club despite several notable lows during his time at the Red Devils.",
      "Given Maguire is now in the final eight months of his deal he could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January 1. The Daily Mail report that regular discussions continue between the club and the player but a decision from the hierarchy is yet to be made.",
      "Formal talks have yet to take place and there is no offer on the table. Any chance of Maguire taking a pay cut would depend on the length of a new contract being offered to him.",
      "Maguire's Anfield heroics were not the first time he's come up trumps late in a game. He scored in the final minute of extra-time to beat Lyon in last season's Europa League. In the aftermath of his winner in Liverpool it might have been his last appearance there in a United shirt.",
      "He said: \"I’m in my last year now, so this could be the last time I played at Anfield for this club. It’s really important that I’ve come here and ticked that one off.\"",
      "Maguire was linked with a move to West Ham when Erik ten Hag, who stripped him of the captaincy, was in charge. Back in the summer United rejected bids from clubs at home and abroad for their defender. Retaining homegrown talent is a priority for the club.",
      "Maguire is one of only four over the age of 21, and veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton is likely to leave at the end of the season. Premier League teams are only allowed a maximum of 17 non-homegrown players, furthering their need to keep English talent in Manchester.",

      "A historic win at Anfield has caused shockwaves throughout the Manchester United community this week. And Harry Maguire continues to rake in the plaudits after Paul Scholes lavished praise on the defender for his match-winning moment.",
      "However, the 84th-minute decider on Merseyside wasn't the only aspect of Maguire's play that impressed the United icon. Not only that, but fellow Red Devils great Steve Bruce was in agreement about the £80million man's contribution.",
      "Despite his past struggles at United, Maguire has emerged on the other side a hero following his late winner against Liverpool. And Scholes was one of the first to aim praise at the England international following Sunday's result.",
      "Appearing on the latest episode of 'The Good, The Bad and the Football', Scholes told former team-mates Nicky Butt and Steve Bruce: \"I was just going to say. I was just going to say that in both boxes, he’s brilliant.",
      "\"He heads everything away and he always looks like he’s going to grab you a goal, which ‘Brucey’ will tell you as a centre-half.\"",
      "Former United star Bruce concurred with Scholes' assessment and dubbed Maguire \"very, very good.\" It was Bruce who brought the then-Sheffield United prospect to Hull City in the summer of 2014 for just £2.5m, though he would go on to move for more than 30 times that fee five years later.",
      "Former Red Devils skipper Maguire has been subject to extensive criticism at United, with many feeling in the past he had failed to justify his £80m price-tag. However, a tide-turning display at Anfield has reminded fans and pundits alike as to just how effective the player can still be on his day.",
      "Reports have emerged suggesting Barcelona will consider allowing Robert Lewandowski to leave for free next summer when his contract expires. The Catalan club has the option of extending the striker's deal for 12 months should they wish, but it's suggested the 37-year-old could be released due to concerns over his age.",
      "That could be great news if United see value in his signing, almost 15 years after they first made a move. And Lewandowski could be open to the idea of a switch to Old Trafford after previously liking the idea when Sir Alex Ferguson attempted to recruit him in 2012. \"To Manchester United I decided and said yes,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I wanted to join Manchester United to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "Lewandowski had just enjoyed a breakthrough campaign at Borussia Dortmund when United came looking for his signature. However, it wasn't meant to be as the Black and Yellows kept hold of their star before he eventually joined Bayern Munich.",
      "\"They [Dortmund] could not sell me,\" he added. \"Because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could wait maybe one or two more years. But it is true that I said yes to Manchester United.\"",
      "Despite his advanced years, a short-term deal for Lewandowski could be of huge value to young striker Benjamin Sesko. And it plays into the Red Devils' hands that the Pole, who will be free to discuss a move in January, has already taken to the idea of joining United in the past.",

      "Mbappe has five goals, while Rashford has notched four goals plus an assist. Elsewhere, Fermin Lopez scored a superb ha-trick and Ayoub El Kaabi grabbed a consolation effort.",
      "Posting on Instagram, Rashford uploaded several snaps from the match, alongside some upbeat comments. \"[An] Amazing night at home,\" he penned. \"What a TEAM! ! Visca Barca.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford continued his impressive start as a Barcelona player by scoring twice in their 6-1 demolition of Olympiakos on Tuesday night. Rashford joined Barca on loan from Manchester United in the summer transfer window and has settled into Hansi Flick's side.",
      "Rashford was frozen out at United, demoted from the first team and forced to train with the other unwanted players in the bomb squad by Ruben Amorim. The England striker was the first of those exiled players to escape Old Trafford, getting his wish by joining Barca until the end of the 2025/26 season.",
      "He was extremely excited to be moving to the Catalan giants and has exceeded expectations, with some believing he would merely be a back-up player. But two goals in the Champions League against Olympiakos means he now has an impressive tally of five goals and five assists across 12 games in all competitions this season.",
      "With the injured Robert Lewandowski unavailable and Ferran Torres on the bench, Rashford was fielded as a centre-forward by Flick, with Lamine Yamal, Fermin Lopez and Dro Fernandez playing in support of the United loanee. And while Lopez grabbed a hat-trick, it was the brace from Rashford that will have raised eyebrows in the red half of Manchester.",
      "Rashford won the penalty that Yamal scored to make it 3-1 and effectively secure the three points after Olympiakos had a man sent off. And he then found the back of the net twice in quick succession, scoring in the 74th and 79th minute.",
      "His two goals means he has either scored or assisted in eight of his last nine matches for Barcelona, representing a return to his best. There were glimpses of his undeniable talent during the brief loan spell with Aston Villa last season, but the consistency is now evident under Flick.",
      "The former Germany manager clearly has no issue with fielding Rashford as a No.9, despite Amorim's reservations. The 27-year-old has generally played off the left side in recent years, yet feels comfortable in a central position for Barca.",
      "“Marcus can be a No 9 or a No 11,” Flick said recently. “When we think of him, we value the fact that he can play in more than one position. He has given us a lot of positives and, of course, he can play as a centre forward.”",
      "That was proven on Tuesday night and Rashford will be hoping that he can maintain his stunning form, with one eye on earning a permanent transfer to Barcelona and one on earning a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the 2026 World Cup.",

      "Jurgen Klopp has spoken openly about his managerial career while reminiscing on some interesting moments from the world of football during a podcast appearance on The Diary of a CEO. The former Liverpool boss left Anfield last summer after nine remarkable years, during which he won eight major titles, including the Premier League, Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and FA Cup.",
      "At the time, Klopp explained that exhaustion was a key factor in his decision but accepted a role with Red Bull as their Global Head of Soccer at the start of this year. Most recently, the German has taken on another position with the German Football League.",
      "Over a year since his departure from Merseyside, Klopp has already made his future plans clear, admitting he does not miss coaching. Nonetheless, The Mirror has taken a closer look at some of his moments and experiences as a manager during his conversation with Steven Bartlett on The Diary of a CEO podcast.",
      "Here are five eye-opening comments from Klopp that have stood out.",
      "Every manager has a unique approach to coaching, and while some have followed different paths in their careers, Klopp explained his own method.",
      "\"In all the other moments, they have to be themselves, they have [to be themselves], so treat them like that. So, my number one thing is to lead yourself - that's the first one,\" he began when discussing player treatment. \"In the morning, you have to get up and kick your own butt and say 'come on.' Then the people you lead, you need to understand [how] to do it properly, so that means you'll talk to them, you'll listen to them.",
      "\"You'll ask where they're from, what's your background, what are we doing here, there, and why did you do that? Stuff like this. It means already in that conversation it's clear, it's different to the other guy. It's not about the rules, like punctuality, early in, late out - it's not about these kinds of things, but how can we get the best out of people if we treat them all the same?",
      "\"It's crazy. I don't think it's like that but I've only worked in this football business so maybe it's just working here. For me, it's super important that you really pick an individual from where it stands, not from where you want them to be.\"",
      "When asked about which two players he treated differently based on their origin, Klopp would make it clear that senior players like James Milner would help younger stars integrate into the team.",
      "The German added: \"As an example, so Trent Alexander-Arnold comes up to the first team, then James Milner is already 31 or whatever. So James makes it clear, first and foremost that Trent doesn't go crazy [and get overwhelmed], because he's seen all these kind of things, but there's so many things, just as an example, James doesn't have to do this and that because you know, he's doing it anyway.",
      "\"So for Trent, you still have to educate the boy. This example which you probably didn't think of, explains how they different they are at their age groups, one is 16, 17 and the other is 33 so that shows already that's not possible.",
      "\"So, you are talking about rules in football that everybody has to work hard, everybody has to do it. In my game, everybody has to defend the s*** of the opposition team. Everybody has to buy into that. I always said if you're not Lionel Messi, you have to defend.",
      "\"But then, to get there, and really grow together as a group. In a group, everybody accepts they are different, and just because we have the same shirt, we all have our own qualities so to bring them to life or let them shine, you have to get treated in the right way and that's what I love to figure out, how is that possible.\"",
      "Klopp and Salah appeared to have a 'heated' touchline exchange during a match with West Ham in April 2024. However, the 58-year-old described the incident as not a 'real big thing.'",
      "\"We had this one argument I think with Mo at West Ham at the sideline when he didn't start, I brought him on and he was not happy,\" Klopp explained. \"Our problems then are always in public, that was not a real, big thing, but in the moment, we didn't agree definitely.",
      "\"So, how you deal with that the next day, I think I can say we have a very good relationship today, even though on that day, it didn't look like it. So you learn, you try to do it the right way and show players respect but at one point, it's never enough and you have to accept that as well, because the players, they grow, they get bigger and bigger and at one point, you hear years later - he never spoke to me, another player says about a former coach, about me, [or] Jose Mourinho.",
      "\"I always tried that when we had arguments [with players], we always found a way out and it never got carried into the team that I lost [their] respect, they [never] lost respect for me because I act that way. We always stayed together, we always found a way that they understood.\"",
      "Back in 2013, Manchester United were preparing for life after Sir Alex Ferguson and had contacted Klopp regarding the managerial role. But after talks, the German decided it was not the right project for him.",
      "\"I spoke to them. So in the year when Sir Alex retired, they spoke to me, yeah, yeah, of course, they were interested at one point,\" Klopp said. \"At that time, I would have been interested, I was young, I had a sensational team at Dortmund, my God. Somebody, they probably thought, what is he doing there?",
      "\"They tried [to pursue it]. It was the wrong time, wrong moment for me. I had a contract at Dortmund, I wouldn't have left, not really for nobody at that time. They just needed a manager but the manager they wanted in that case, it was one of a few options I think.",
      "So was it you that turned down Manchester United? \"Yeah, that way,\" Klopp revealed. \"He's not there the guy who negotiated that, it was long ago, long ago.\"",
      "Why wouldn't you take that job? \"This is typical because we are not in a private space. There are some reasons but the people in that conversation told me, which I didn't like. So United was that big, we get all the players we want, we get him, we get him, we get him and I was sitting there. So it was not my project, it didn't feel like it. It was the wrong time but on top of that, it was not my project.",
      "\"I didn't want to bring back, [Paul] Pogba, my God he is a sensational player but these things, don't work usually. Or Cristiano [Ronaldo], my God, we all know he's the best player or together with Messi as the best players in the world. But bringing back, never helps. In that time, in 2013, it was obviously not about Cristiano, but it was just the idea of bringing the best players together and then let's go.",
      "It wasn't about the football? \"No, not at all. And I sat there and was like 'nah, I'm not sure. That's not for me.' And then, the pure, pure football project comes up with Liverpool.\"",
      "United are still a long way from where they were under Sir Ferguson, but Bartlett - a Manchester United fan - has complete faith in the new team working behind the scenes.",
      "Bartlett said: \"I fully believe in Ruben Amorim, I think he's a man who's focused on culture and I like how honest he is. I think the people they have around them, with people like Jason Wilcox and Ineos, who I've met, and all the others who are there, I think we've never been in a better place. I personally feel like that because I just think they're aiming for more long-term things.\"",
      "Klopp responded: \"The only problem is you have no clue about football but besides that, good on you.\"",
      "Klopp sees huge potential in Florian Wirtz despite his challenging start at Liverpool and has suggested that the 22-year-old will prove his doubters wrong.",
      "\"You all will eat your words if you use the wrong words with Florian Wirtz,\" the former Reds boss said. \"He’s an incredible talent and player.\"",
      "The relationship between Klopp and Darwin Nunez has had its ups and downs over the years, with the German admitting that the player's lack of game time and form may have contributed. However, he also implied that there are no regrets over signing him.",
      "\"We had an absolutely good relationship, as good as it can be with a striker who is not scoring as often as he wants, as the people want and as I think he could have,\" he stated. \"With a striker who didn't play as often as definitely he wants, so how can you have a fantastic relationship?",
      "\"If he would have stood there and be the number one and jumping after me, crying his eyes out and hugging me for 10 minutes, I would be like 'okay, what's going on here?' Completely normal situation. My first concern cannot to please everybody, it's just not possible.",
      "\"It's not possible in that job. The first problem starts with 25 players, 11 starting positions. So, more players are not happy than you make happy, that's already where the problem starts. You have to get through this and I'm pretty sure he had super moments at Liverpool.",
      "\"We had super moments together and on my last day, if I was him, I would have thought as well, 'okay, come on, the next one is a new chance for me' because players do that. If it goes really well for them, it's not that they think that it's thanks to the coach.",
      "\"If it's not going well, they think, 'he doesn't bring me on enough, it's not my fault,' but we are humans, we are all the same. So it's not that they are special in that moment and some of them think, 'I have to do more, in week one, two and three and three weeks more, he's still not picking me,' you cannot always have harmony and flowers and all these kind of things.",
      "\"It's a competitive environment and you have to perform to get what you think you deserve.\"",
      "Did you decide you wanted to sign Darwin? \"[We] Decided all together, involved in that process,\" Klopp replied.",
      "\"And yes, that's how it is nowadays, we would have loved to sign him for lesser money, of course, but in that moment it was not possible and we needed a striker.",
      "\"We only wanted to have an extra option for striker, we had Bobby [Firmino], the best false nine in the world, and now we needed somebody with a bit more speed and more action. Of course we all signed him together and I have no problem to admit.",
      "\"Maybe it didn't work out as good as it could but without Darwin Nunez, so many things wouldn't have happened. The biggest comeback of all times at Newcastle, for example. I love that day. I love that day.\"",

      "Manchester United are ready to join the race to sign Elliot Anderson.",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson has become a hot property after his stunning breakthrough into the England team. Manchester City and Chelsea have also been watching developments with the midfielder who only turns 23 next month and is seen as one of English football’s best prospects.",
      "That has also alerted United who do want to rebuild their midfield as their next priority and they have also looked at Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and also Crystal Palace’s England prospect Adam Wharton. But United are also big admirers of Anderson who only made his England debut in September but has now won four senior caps and is seen as a strong possibility to start in next year’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson was sold by Newcastle for £35million last year but it was regarded as a massive blow and something they had to do to balance the books and fall into line with Profit and Sustainability Rules. His progress since then has been eye-catching both as a defensive midfielder and a player who can make forward runs.",
      "Forest would clearly be determined to keep a prize asset and would not want to sell despite the growing interest in Anderson, who is now valued at around £75m.",
      "City have been eyeing reinforcements for their midfield as Rodri has struggled to come back to full fitness. Chelsea have also bought well when it comes to young English talent but they are well stocked in that department.",
      "United bought big in the summer with their forward line and splashed in excess of £200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. But a late move in the summer window for Baleba was resisted by Brighton and yet showed that United are in the market for a shake-up.",
      "They want to have a better balance in midfield and may look to get in two new players with Bruno Fernandes attracting interest while Casemiro is out of contract this summer.",
      "Anderson is under contract with Forest until June 2029 and will command a hefty fee. He is a key player for the team, having played the full match in all 10 of Forest's Premier League and Europa League matches this season.",
      "United contacted Brighton over the availability of Baleba in the summer transfer window, but the move went nowhere, with the Seagulls sticking to their transfer valuation.",
      "\"I don't think Baleba was a saga,\" Brighton owner Tony Bloom told The Argus recently. \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",

      "The words Mohamed Salah and goal have become synonymous in his time at Anfield, so it's little wonder Liverpool star Curtis Jones was anticipating success from his team-mate. Perhaps celebrating early against Manchester United was just a little too overconfident.",
      "With the Reds 1-0 down on Sunday, a cross across the box avoided all bodies until it reached Salah on the right. The Egyptian superstar found himself with a moment of time in the 65th minute.",
      "After Salah's first touch, Jones was caught on camera already wheeling away with one arm raised and ready to punch the air. But the ball stuck close to Salah's feet while United goalkeeper Senne Lammens narrowed the angle available to last season's Premier League top goalscorer.",
      "Salah could only poke the ball wide at speed as he failed to score against Liverpool's rivals. The 33-year-old was eventually substituted in the 86th minute despite his side still chasing the game.",
      "Jones could only put his hands on his head in disappointment as the ball flew out for a goal kick.",
      "United earned a shock 2-1 win at Anfield, for the first time since 2016. Going into Sunday's clash, Salah had bagged 15 goals and made six assists in his previous 11 games against the Red Devils.",
      "Salah has now not scored in more than a month. The forward's form is now becoming the subject of conversation in addition to Liverpool's four defeats in a row.",
      "“I think after games like this it’s quite normal that people are focused on individual players,\" Slot said following the game. \"After four-five games, it was the players we signed, now it is Mohamed Salah.",
      "\"We have more than enough chances to win the game. Mo missed a big one, others missed big ones, and we are not used to this with Mo.”",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has suggested Salah is no longer one of the first names on the teamsheet for Slot. \"It’s a real headache for the coach, and we’ll see what he does. It’s interesting that he subbed him off,\" he said.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp used to take him off quite often, which shows that, even in the past, Mo Salah could have a poor game and be replaced, even if he still had some energy and sharpness left.\"",
      "\"We’ve reached a point with Mo Salah where he shouldn’t be playing every game. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘he’s the first name on the team sheet’ anymore. He’s still part of your best XI, he plays the home matches, but maybe it’s time to think differently.\"",

      "Xabi Alonso has suggested he would be reluctant to allow Endrick to depart Real Madrid. Manchester United are among the clubs reportedly keen on securing the 19-year-old on loan when the January transfer window opens.",
      "However, they are said to face competition from Juventus, Newcastle United and West Ham United, who are all reputedly monitoring the situation. French publication L'Equipe claims Marseille are also tracking the teenager as a potential replacement for Amine Gouiri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who will participate in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "Endrick himself is reportedly eager for a temporary switch in pursuit of regular first-team football if his circumstances at Real Madrid remain unchanged. He has his sights set on securing a spot in Brazil's World Cup squad for next summer.",
      "Following an injury that ruled him out of the opening five fixtures across all competitions, the striker has remained an unused substitute for the previous six matches. That means he is yet to feature for the club this campaign.",
      "Alonso has now responded to enquiries regarding the prospect of Endrick departing on loan in January. Yet he appeared to suggest that he would prefer to retain him within his squad.",
      "\"Endrick on loan? We're not at that point yet,\" he told reporters at a press conference ahead of Madrid's Champions League clash against Juventus.",
      "\"The competition in attack is intense. We have to be prepared for every game. Endrick, Gonzalo, and Brahim have to be ready.",
      "\"They're going to come in, and have to be ready. This is the elite, and we need a lot of good players.\"",
      "Endrick's yearning for more time on the pitch, and his evident frustration at not receiving it, was displayed over the weekend, as reported by Spanish publication AS. The forward was said to be noticeably upset when he was an unused substitute during the 1-0 victory against Getafe on Sunday.",
      "Kylian Mbappe's goal in the 80th minute secured the 1-0 win, with Getafe eventually down to nine men. Endrick is said to have kicked a bottle in anger on the bench when both Brahim Diaz and Gonzalo Garcia came onto the pitch ahead of him in the 86th minute of the match.",

      "Giorgi Mamardashvili has been harshly criticised for being at fault for both goals during Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United. The Reds suffered their fourth consecutive loss against their fierce rivals at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "This result marks the club's worst run of results since 2014, with £29m summer signing Mamardashvili making his home league debut in goal, replacing the injured Alisson Becker. Liverpool had a disastrous start to the match as Bryan Mbeumo put the away side ahead, squeezing the ball past Mamardashvili.",
      "There is certainly an argument to be made that the 25-year-old goalkeeper was beaten too easily at his near post for United's opener. He also fumbled a cross from Matheus Cunha which nearly resulted in a goal for Mason Mount.",
      "However, there was little the Georgian could have done about Harry Maguire's late winner as the defender headed a volleyed cross from Bruno Fernandes home from just six yards out. Despite this, former United keeper Ben Foster has surprisingly suggested that Alisson would've come out to claim the cross if he had been in goal.",
      "\"For the first one, I was really disappointed,\" the ex-England and Wrexham stopper said on his Fozcast podcast. \"He got dragged into that space and he's into no man's land, because you've not got much space to operate in. He can't go and affect the ball because you can tell Mbeumo's just getting it onto that right foot and he's shooting.",
      "\"What he's done, though, is he's closed that space and closed his reaction time off, so he's basically just got to hope it hits him. Whereas if he had just stayed where he was, he could have reacted to that. When you're not playing, you start to do things like that.",
      "\"I think the difference is that Allison is so set in his position. He knows where he is. He's so comfortable with his surroundings when that ball comes in [for the second goal]. When he sees that, he's thinking, 'Can I come for the cross?' A goalie at the top of his game at this moment in time just comes and punches that away.\"",
      "There is currently no definite timescale set for the return of Alisson from the hamstring injury he sustained against Galatasaray last month. Mamardashvili made his Premier League bow in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Chelsea, where he was left with little chance for either goal conceded by the Reds.",
      "Despite Foster's criticism of his performance against United, Mamardashvili received a vote of confidence from Liverpool boss Arne Slot earlier this month.",
      "The Dutchman said: \"We knew we were bringing in a very good goalkeeper, but when he plays his first game, that's always the best way of seeing that he's adjusted well or not. He's adjusted really well to our club, which is not a surprise because he's a quality goalkeeper.\"",
      "Mamardashvili is set to continue as Liverpool's first-choice keeper in Alisson's absence, with a demanding schedule of seven matches in 22 days ahead for the Reds. That includes Champions League fixtures at Eintracht Frankfurt and a home game against Real Madrid, plus a challenging Premier League match at Manchester City.",
      "Last month, Mamardashvili said: \"I have had to be patient. It doesn't matter if I play or not, I have to be ready. I work hard every day.\"",

      "Liverpool face a talking to from the Premier League over claims they breached the multi-ball protocol multiple times during Sunday's defeat to Manchester United. Clubs have been fined in the past for repeated breaches, but a reminder of the rules in this instance will likely be the course of action from the league.",
      "Ball assistants threw Liverpool players balls when they went out of play in the aftermath of Harry Maguire putting United 2-1 up in the 84th minute. Replacement balls are instead supposed to be on cones around the pitch, not handed back.",
      "The rule change took effect in the 2022/23 season, requiring outfield players to either retrieve the ball themselves or proceed to the nearest cone. Goalkeepers are the only exception when restarting play with a goal kick.",
      "Premier League guidance states that \"participants must not interfere with the multi-ball system, the match ball or the replacement balls at any time.\"",
      "It is said that \"any failure to follow the multi-ball protocol will be referred to the Premier League for further investigation and possible regulatory action under the Premier League rules.\"",
      "Aston Villa received a £125,000 fine in mid-August after conceding that they failed to follow protocol in five matches last season, including on several occasions when ball assistants handed the ball to their players. They were also not allowed to use the multi-ball system in their first three home league matches of this season.",
      "A statement from the Premier League read: \"Clubs are required to adopt a multi-ball system at every league match and adherence to the relevant rules and guidance is of vital importance to maintain consistency and, crucially, to ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "The Daily Mail reports that there is an expectation that Liverpool will not receive a fine, adding that United are not known to have made a complaint.",
      "Liverpool and the Premier League have so far made no comment.",

      "“Because that gives them even more belief. If you had told me we are 1-0 down against a United team that played in the style they did, and you had told me that we would create eight, nine, or 10 open chances, then I would have said to you that I don't think that is possible. But it was possible. So, the second thing that went wrong is that from all the chances we got, we only scored one goal.",
      "“I have said it in Holland many times and maybe I've said it here as well, it's almost impossible to win a big game of football - and Liverpool v United is a big game with so many quality players on the pitch - to win it with a negative set-piece balance. We conceded another one and that led to us losing the game.”",

      "The goalkeeper has looked extremely assured in his opening two matches for the club, and after more than two seasons of watching Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir commit costly errors, a young 'keeper bringing security and confidence to the backline deserves to be recognised.",
      "In truth, Lammens enjoyed a much quieter afternoon than he would have been expecting at the home of the Premier League champions at Anfield on Sunday, with the woodwork forced into action almost as many times as the Belgian shot-stopper. But when he was called upon he didn't put a foot wrong.",
      "His finest save of the afternoon came in the first half, as Ibrahima Konate's through ball from in his own half cut through the United backline to release Alexander Isak. The Swede looked nailed on to level the scores, only for Lammens to stand tall and repel his low, driven effort.",
      "While the save was worthy of the highlights reel, United cannot bury their heads in the sand and ignore the way the chance was created.",
      "With Konate more than 50 yards away from the United goal, had Lammens been on the front foot he would have had plenty of time to anticipate the pass and sweep up the danger. Instead, the former Royal Antwerp goalkeeper stayed rooted to his line, affording Isak the chance to make it 1-1.",
      "It's by no means a criticism of Lammens. 'Sweeper keeper' has become a staple in the lexicon of every football hipster in recent years, but there's more than one way to play the position.",

      "\"It means a lot today but tomorrow it won't mean a lot,\" he said after the final whistle at Anfield.",
      "The challenge now is to build a brighter future. Beating the champions is a significant yet small step. Great teams do more.",
      "\"If we show the spirit we did today, in training and in games, we will win so many games,\" said Amorim after the win over Arne Slot's side.",
      "\"But for that we need to take action. Now we must focus on Brighton.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher must burst with pride when he watches his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, play in the academy.",
      "The 41-year-old was in attendance at Oakwell Stadium and had a perfect view of Jack's goal.",
      "Chido Obi brilliantly won the ball from Vimal Yoganathan just outside the Barnsley penalty area, and Jack Fletcher pounced to finish into the right corner thanks to a slight deflection.",
      "Fletcher scored an instinctive volley from 35 yards that dipped under the crossbar when he last played at Oakwell Stadium in 2024. His deflected goal may not have been as impressive, but they all count.",
      "Manchester United signed the Fletcher twins for £1.25million from Manchester City in the summer of 2023. The pair opted to move to United and are now pushing towards being involved with the first team.",
      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",
      "Travis Binnion named an Under-21 team that included players on the cusp of the first team against Barnsley, with Chido Obi, Shea Lacey, Tyler Fredricson and Diego Leon all starting.",
      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",
      "Stephen Torpey sat alongside Jason Wilcox. The pair recently sat together at Old Trafford following Torpey's appointment as head of the academy (succeeding Nick Cox).",
      "Torpey and Wilcox returned to the warmth during half-time while Darren Fletcher passed on tactical feedback to an analyst. Fletcher is the Under-18 manager, but had clearly spotted something.",
      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",
      "However, former Ipswich Town, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest striker McGoldrick wasn't done there and netted his hat-trick. Then Jack Fletcher was shown a red card in a bizarre incident with the referee.",
      "It seemed Fletcher received his marching orders for dissent. Perhaps a strange decision, but his father might argue that there is a lesson to learn: you must control emotions on a football pitch.",
      "Barnsley smelt blood after the sending off and scored another two goals to claim a 5-2 victory. Wilcox had seen enough with seven minutes remaining, but Torpey remained in the stands to see the game out.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Had Manchester United got their way, Casemiro would not still be playing at Old Trafford.",
      "United engaged several agents to try and sell Casemiro before the January transfer deadline, and they tried their luck again in the summer transfer window. Yet again they were unsuccessful.",
      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",
      "Seven weeks on from the closure of the summer transfer window and the narrative has definitely changed.",
      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",
      "If this is to be his final year at Old Trafford, United are learning how to get the best out of him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Hello and welcome to MEN Sport's live coverage of all things Manchester United on Wednesday, September 22.",
      "Following Sunday's incredible 2-1 win over Liverpool, United are enjoying a whole week of training ahead of the upcoming Premier League clash with Brighton. Ruben Amorim's men will be looking to win three successive games for the first time under the Portuguese.",
      "Elsewhere, as we approach November and get closer to January, transfer noise is increasing, and United are being linked with more fresh names. The latest is Real Madrid forward Endrick.",
      "It's been reported that the Brazilian will be allowed to leave the club on loan in January. After scoring seven goals in 37 games last season, the wonderkid is yet to play a minute under Xabi Alonso this term.",
      "In midfield, both Morten Hjulmand and Angelo Stiller continue to be linked with a move to Old Trafford. Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton are also reportedly on their list ahead of January.",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has had his say on what he believes the Glazers are asking for to sell their shares in Manchester United.",
      "“I think it’s unlikely [a takeover] will be how its played out, when Ratcliffe came in we saw how that played out,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“A big bid from Qatar we were led to believe that was full takeover and it wasn’t at the price that the Glazers wanted. I’ve always suggested that they are after a higher price for their exit which is certainly more than £5billion, there’s been rumours that they want £10billion in the future to exit.",
      "“With football clubs though we say it all the time they’re really for sale, if the right offer comes in then people will listen.”",
      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Every Man United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens. Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "Read more here.",
      "According to reports, Man United have no intention of letting Joshua Zirkzee leave the club in January.",
      "The young Dutch forward joined the Reds last summer and made an instant impact, scoring a late winner against Fulham on his Premier League debut. That goal raised expectations for a prolific season, but so far, he has struggled to find consistent scoring form.",
      "The i paper claims that Zirkzee isn't actively pushing for a move but is reportedly open to considering his options. The striker is said to be 'unhappy' with his current situation at United, and West Ham are believed to be preparing a loan move for him in January.",
      "Several Italian clubs are also monitoring Zirkzee’s situation, with Roma reportedly among those showing interest.",
      "Man United loanee Rashford has said that the chance to play in El Clasico against Real Madrid is one of the reasons he made the move to Barcelona in the summer, and has also made an admission about his best position.",
      "Rashford continued to impress as he scored a brace in his side's 6-1 Champions League win over Olympiacos on Tuesday. Despite previous assertions from Rashford himself that his best position is on the left, he excelled in a more central position against the Greek side.",
      "After the game, Rashford admitted: \"It could be my best performance with Barca. I'm ready to bring out the best in me in the team,\" he told UEFA. \"I prefer to play on the wing, but I don't care. I intend to help and do the best I can.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "\"Manchester United are reportedly still keeping tabs on Morten Hjulmand ahead of next year.",
      "Sporting CP boss Rui Borges was asked about the Reds' interest, to which he replied: \"A lot of questions [laughs]… We don’t have any tears, unlike last season. Muscle tears.",
      "\"Hjulmand is Hjulmand. Our leader, captain. He won’t always be at his best, but he’s always important. He demands of himself and his teammates every day. As for United, it’s October, and I’m focused on Marseille.\"",
      "Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso has hinted that he may not be willing to let Manchester United-linked forward Endrick leave the club.",
      "United are among the teams reportedly interested in taking the 19-year-old on a loan deal when the January transfer window reopens. But they are not alone; Juventus, Newcastle United, and West Ham United are also said to be keen on a deal.",
      "L'Equipe report in France that Marseille are also eyeing the teenager as a potential replacement for Amine Gouiri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who will be part of the Africa Cup of Nations in the new year. Endrick himself is said to be desperate for a move in search of more game time if his current situation at Real Madrid doesn’t change, as he targets a place in Brazil's World Cup squad for next summer.",
      "After missing the first five games in all competitions through injury, the forward has been an unused substitute for the last six games. It means that he is yet to make an appearance for the club this season. Alonso has now answered a question on the possibility of Endrick going out on loan in January. But he appeared to hint that he would be happy in keeping him as part of his squad.",
      "Former Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has heaped praise on new Man United shot-stopper Senne Lammens and revealed he won't implode if he makes a big mistake.",
      "The 23-year-old is regarded as one of the most talented young goalkeepers in Europe and has already impressed in his early days at M16. Lammens kept a clean sheet on his United debut against Sunderland before another confident performance in Sunday's 2-1 win at Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "And Mignolet has delivered his verdict on what makes his compatriot so good, having played with Lammens at Club Brugge in the Belgian Pro League. \"He has the build and the qualities to succeed in England. He’s big, explosive, and strong on high balls. And he can save balls that other goalkeepers can’t,” Mignolet said, via Voetbal Primeur.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Man United have identified AS Roma midfielder Manu Kone as a possible midfielder target, according to reports.",
      "United in Focus have reported that the 24-year-old is one of the new names on Ruben Amorim's shortlist. Kone joined the Italian side in 2024 from Borussia Monchengladbach and has attracted plenty of interest from Europe.",
      "Man United are reportedly set to battle Tottenham and Chelsea for the signing of Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "In the summer, the striker will become a free agent with him yet to agree a new deal in Turin. It's believed that multiple clubs are monitoring the situation with TuttoJuve claims all three Premier League sides are keen.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly requested that the Man United hierarchy sign Sporting CP defender Ousmane Diomande.",
      "Fichajes has claimed that United are preparing a bid worth €50m. The centre-back has bene linked with a move to the Premier League for some time and previously worked with Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Highly-rated Man United talent Bendito Mantato has been named in the England Under-17s World Cup squad.",
      "After catching the eye of Ruben Amorim and training with the first-team, Mantato will represent his country in the World Cup, which kicks-off at the start of November.",
      "England play Venezuela, Haiti and Egypt in the group stage.",
      "Fichajes have reported that Italian champions Napoli are 'very close' to agreeing a deal to sign Kobbie Mainoo on loan.",
      "The 20-year-old continues to be linked with a move out of Old Trafford after struggling for regular minutes. With the World Cup coming next summer, the report claims that the midfielder is pushing for an exit for January.",
      "Xabi Alonso has said that Endrick has to be ready and is going to come into the team after being asked about the Brazil international leaving Real Madrid on loan.",
      "We're not at that point yet. The competition in attack is intense. We have to be prepared for every game. Endrick, Gonzalo, and Brahim have to be ready. They're going to come in, and have to be ready. This is the elite, and we need a lot of good players.",
      "The i Paper have claimed that Liverpool have joined United and Tottenham in the race to sign Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo.",
      "It's said that the Ghana international, who only signed a new contract in the summer, is viewed as a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah. Semenyo has scored six Premier League goals this season.",
      "United are reportedly ready to enter a three-way transfer race for Elliot Anderson.",
      "The Mirror reports that Chelsea and Manchester City are also watching the England international. Nottingham Forest are said to value their midfielder at £75million, although they do not want to sell the Newcastle United academy graduate so soon.",
      "Spanish sides Sevilla and Real Betis are set to compete to sign Man United forwad Joshua Zirkzee in January.",
      "That's according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim the forward's limited minutes could force him to leave. The report claims that sources close to Zirkzee suggest he could be open to a loan move.",
      "Sevilla are believed to be willing to sign him for just six months.",
      "Stuttgart have slapped a £43million price tag on United-linked Angelo Stiller.",
      "Marcus Rashford was once again one of Barcelona's better players in the Champions League on Tuesday night as he scored twice in their 6-1 win over Olympiacos.",
      "The out-on-loan Manchester United forward continued his impressive form in the competition, scoring a brace in the second half and also winning a penalty for his team.",
      "As a result, he's now level with France star Kylian Mbappe in goal contributions in the tournament. Meanwhile, United have struggled for goals so far this season, with Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all scoring two goals each.",
      "Man United have opened 'informal talks' with Harry Maguire over a one-year contract extension, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Talks are not yet to reach a formal stage, but it's believed that Maguire is keen on some clarity on his future before the January window. At the start of 2026, he will be open to sign a pre-contract with an overseas club.",
      "Hello and good morning! Welcome to today's live Man United transfer blog.",
      "Yesterday was a hectic day so worry not, we'll start by bringing you the big headlines from Tuesday. My name is Josh Holland and I will be taking you through the latest transfer news throughout today.",
      "Scott McTominay has become the latest player to send Manchester United a message as he continued his form in the Champions League this evening.",
      "Following Marcus Rashford's display in the competition for Barcelona, scoring two goals and winning a penalty, it was now McTominay's turn to shine. The former Manchester United star scored the opening goal for Napoli against PSV, heading the ball into the net.",
      "He had missed Napoli's 1-0 defeat to Torino last week due to an ankle issue, but that problem now appears to be behind him.",
      "Read more here.",
      "talkSPORT claims Man United have opened 'informal talks' with Maguire over a one-year extension.",
      "Talks have reportedly not yet reached a formal stage, but Maguire would like clarity before the January window opens, when he would be eligible to sign a pre-contract with an overseas club. The defender is believed to be open to extending his contract but that would require the 32-year-old to take a pay cut.",
      "The report adds that Maguire is seeking clarity sooner rather than later, so he can focus on his football as he aims to secure a place in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for the World Cup.",
      "Marcus Rashford once again shone in the Champions League as Barcelona secured an emphatic 6-1 home victory against Olympiakos.",
      "The out-on-loan Manchester United forward continued his impressive form in the competition, scoring a brace in the second half and also winning a penalty for his team.",
      "As a result, he's now level with France star Kylian Mbappe in goal contributions in the tournament. Meanwhile, United have struggled for goals so far this season, with Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all scoring two goals each.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Former United assistant coach Rene Meulensteen has spoken about the possibility of Rashford returning to Old Trafford, stating that it is unlikely while Ruben Amorim remains in charge.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford back to Man Utd? That's a real personal choice, and things can change, you don't know.",
      "\"I don't think it would happen with Ruben Amorim, to be fair, because I think something must have happened for that move to be forced. So I don't know, but I think Marcus, and maybe Barcelona as well, would most likely want to see if they could make it a permanent deal because Marcus is 27 now, so he's still a good age.",
      "\"Playing in Spain is different than in the Premier League. It's not as demanding, especially with Barcelona having maybe 70% or more of the ball, which is a nice position to be in.\"",
      "Fichajes report that Sevilla and Real Betis are set to compete for the services of Zirkzee.",
      "The forward is said to be seriously considering leaving United in January due to a lack of regular game time. Sources close to the player suggest he could accept a loan move to regain his form and rhythm.",
      "Sevilla are believed to be willing to take Zirkzee on loan, although United would reportedly have to cover part of his salary.",
      "Anderson remains tied to Forest until June 2029 and would require a substantial transfer fee. The midfielder has become integral to the side, featuring for the entire duration in all 10 of Forest's Premier League and Europa League fixtures this campaign.",
      "United invested heavily during the summer window on their attacking options and spent over £200m bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, a late summer approach for Baleba was knocked back by Brighton, demonstrating that United remain keen on a major overhaul.",
      "The Reds have also approached Brighton regarding Baleba's availability during the summer window, though the pursuit failed to materialise as the Seagulls maintained their asking price.",
      "\"I don't think Baleba was a saga,\" Brighton owner Tony Bloom told The Argus recently. \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "United are reportedly ready to enter a three-way transfer race for Elliot Anderson.",
      "The Mirror reports that Chelsea and Manchester City are also watching the England international. Nottingham Forest are said to value their midfielder at £75million, although they do not want to sell the Newcastle United academy graduate so soon.",
      "Stuttgart are said to value Angelo Stiller at £43million (€50m).",
      "Sky Sport in Germany claims the player can imagine moving clubs this coming summer despite feeling at home with his current employers, with United having him on their radar. The report also acknowledges that the price tag could still change.",
      "Liverpool are said to have joined United and Tottenham Hotspur in the battle to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "The i Paper claims they consider the Bournemouth forward as a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah. Semenyo also reportedly has a release clause in his newly signed contract, which runs until summer 2030."

In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

      "The atmosphere around Manchester United's Carrington training ground this week should be joyous after the club's exploits on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the game with Liverpool, you could see that Ruben Amorim was a whole lot lighter after the victory over Sunderland prior to the international break. However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

      "After showcasing his talent with both the Italian side's Primavera and Under-17s, Vorlicky made his professional debut in a 2-1 Serie A defeat to Lecce in February 2023. He managed to play just seven more minutes across two games against AC Milan and Udinese before a severe knee injury side-lined him.",
      "Shortly after that set-back, he returned to the Czech Republic with Slavia Prague, while contemporaries like Amad and Dejan Kulusevski were snapped up by some of Europe's top clubs. United shelled out £19million for Amad when he was just 18, in October 2020, and he officially joined the club under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2021.",
      "Following loan stints with Rangers and Sunderland, the Ivory Coast star is now a hugely-important part of Ruben Amorim's squad. Meanwhile, Kulusevski was signed by Juventus in 2020 after being named the Serie A Best Young Player of the Season.",
      "Two years on, the Swedish international moved to Tottenham initially on an 18-month loan, which was later made permanent. Both players, when fit, are regular fixtures in the Premier League for their respective teams.",
      "In total, Vorlicky underwent five knee operations over seven years while at Atalanta. Since his return to Prague, he has featured in just 14 matches for the first-team - plus a further 10 for their B squad - with fitness issues continuing to restrict his participation.",
      "Speaking to the Czech newspaper DNES, Vorlicky has discussed his dreadful fortune and how he reckons he could have joined Amad and Kulusevski at United or Tottenham.",
      "\"I don't want this to sound cocky, but yes,\" he said when questioned if he could compete at the same standard as the named duo. People have been telling me, since I was a child, that I could grow up and to be a great footballer. Even more so at Atalanta, because everyone at the club believed in me.",

      "When asked if he holds past doctors responsible for his unfortunate injuries, he added: \"Why? He's only human.",
      "\"He operated on ten people that day, I got bad luck, that happens, I can't change it. Who knows what would have happened if I had been healthy? I'm humanly happy. Would I have been the same if I had continued? I have no idea. I'm just sorry that I didn't play.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford continued his sensational form in the Champions League with another stellar performance for Barcelona on Tuesday night. The Manchester United star, who is on loan with the Spanish giants until the end of the season, was deployed in a new role in the group phase clash with Olympiacos, starting in the centre forward position in the absence of Robert Lewandowski.",
      "The Catalans were 2-0 up at half-time thanks to a brace from Fermin Lopez, but Olympiacos’ potential comeback was hampered by a harsh red card in the 57th minute, after which Barca capitalised on having an extra man by netting four goals to secure a 6-1 win.",
      "Rashford contributed to three of those, initially earning a penalty after being tripped by opposition goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis following a smart one-two with Fermin, which was converted by Lamine Yamal in the 68th minute. The England international got on the scoresheet himself just six minutes later with a sharp diagonal run, taking one touch before slotting low across the goalkeeper into the far corner from the left channel.",
      "He added another in the 79th minute, combining with Pedri on the edge of the box and clinically firing a shot in off the inside of the near post. It was the second European brace the 27-year-old has scored already for his new club, taking his Barcelona tally to five goals and six assists.",
      "Here, we take a look at what the Spanish media made of his all-round performance - with many pointing out how he has already proven to be an astute signing for his new side despite it still being early in his Barcelona career.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Spanish outlet Marca heaped praise on both Rashford and hat-trick hero Fermin, saying: “They're two players who don't make much noise, but who always contribute something to the team.”",
      "The match report also read: “Fermín's not leaving for Chelsea in the summer has been a real blessing for Barcelona. This time, he scored the first hat trick of his Barca career.",
      "“And the Englishman's move is also a real coup. Against Olympiacos, he scored two goals and won a penalty. No one doubts the success of his signing anymore.” Glowing praise indeed.",
      "Diario AS were more than convinced by the Englishman’s display, stating his goal contributions “prove he belongs in this team”. The outlet said: “He scored two goals practically without warning. One after a crisp finish inside the box and another with a short dribble and a shot at the far post.”",
      "Sport identified Rashford as a “difference maker” following the 6-1 victory, stating he could impact the upcoming El Clasico in a similar way. It noted how impressive the Red Devils academy graduate was in the No.9 position, though he could return to his usual role as a winger against Real Madrid.",
      "The publication also praised his set-piece taking ability, saying: “The Englishman is taking free kicks and is getting closer and closer to scoring: posts, balls to the full-back that just miss... It's about time Barca saw someone score from a free kick, a deficit that has been dragging on since Leo Messi's painful departure. The Englishman also takes corners from the left and does so with extreme danger. In the Clasico, he could be a weapon to be reckoned with.”",
      "Manager Hansi Flick, meanwhile, was quoted as saying: “He's an important player and he gives what I expect of him. He's giving 100 percent and it's fantastic to have him. He's playing in different positions; as he gains confidence and gets to know his teammates, he'll get better.”",
      "Mundo Deportivo said: “Rashford in his role as No.9 scored a brace and continued his fine scoring streak.”",
      "It also noted that while he wasn’t as unplayable as he was against Newcastle last month, he showed his quality with his finishing and build-up play, which earned Barca a crucial penalty to make it 3-1.",

      "Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break, meaning United had just a few days to prepare with a full squad to face Liverpool.",

      "\"Even the players who were not going to start, you could feel the energy and the positive energy they were giving to those who were going to start, because at any moment they can be important.",
      "\"You saw the substitutes, they came on and they had to help us defend the game and go after the result again. I'm really proud of everyone, the boys and everyone involved.\"",
      "Dalot continued: \"You can imagine the feeling inside the dressing room, it took me eight years to win at Anfield, so obviously really proud of everyone involved, the players, the staff, everybody on the bench. Great feeling, a beautiful day for us and the fans. Everybody has to enjoy today.\"",
      "When asked if it was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",
      "Dalot added: \"It's part of our job [to deal with outside noise], I've been here long enough to understand everyone will have opinions, everyone will have something to say about Man United.",
      "\"You just have to be ready for that. You're playing for the biggest club in the world and you need to be ready to have bad opinions about you, good opinions about yourself.",
      "\"But it's the way you show it, the way you work every day, sometimes, especially this season, we've been doing really good in training at Carrington, but then the results are not coming on.",
      "\"But that's what everybody sees. They don't see what you do every day. So ultimately, they will judge what you do on the pitch on the weekend, and we have to win games, that has to be the mindset.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo couldn't control his emotions when Harry Maguire scored a match-winning goal in Manchester United's win over Liverpool.",
      "It was a tense state of affairs at Anfield on Sunday, as Ruben Amorim's squad faced Arne Slot's Premier League champions in the north west derby. Bryan Mbeumo took the lead for United just two minutes into the fixture, slotting the ball through the legs of Giorgi Mamardashvili from close-range before wheeling off in celebration in front of the Kop.",
      "And while Cody Gakpo snuck in behind enemy lines 78 minutes into the fixture to make it 1-1, fate had other plans that prevented Liverpool from taking a point from the clash. That's because, six minutes later, Maguire sealed the deal for his club with a well-placed header at the back post and that ensured United claimed a hard-earned victory over their fiercest rivals.",
      "While the away crowd naturally erupted with jubilation, United's official social media account captured Amorim's animated reaction to the ball crossing the line. And, in the background, the clip also showed elation from Mainoo, who beamed with joy as he was hoisted up into the air by a member of the Reds' coaching staff.",
      "It came just moments before Mainoo entered the fray as a substitute for Bruno Fernandes, as Amorim looked to hold on to the lead that his side had earned. And that's exactly what United managed to do, repelling a thick and fast Liverpool onslaught which took place for the duration of the eight additional minutes for stoppage time.",
      "United now enjoy a week-long rest before they face Brighton at Old Trafford - with fixtures against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away from home to play before the November international break. Speaking after the win, Amorim said: \"Every day is special, but of course, this was a very special win.",
      "\"To see our fans singing during the game, in one moment, the biggest rival, they are champions on their field, in their stadium. This win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team, because I believe that we can play so much better.",
      "\"We will try to analyse the game in the same way that we analyse the other ones. Try to see the good things and the bad things, but for me the special thing is the togetherness that they showed during this game. That is special for me.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

He primarily focuses on sports content, with specific expertise in and a passion for football, darts, horse racing, snooker, cricket, Formula One, as well as American football.",
      "Manchester United are one of many clubs with a reported interest in Real Madrid's Endrick. The young Brazilian has been dubbed 'the next Ronaldo' but is finding minutes hard to come by at the Bernabeu.",
      "Having been highly thought of in his home country, the youngster penned a deal with Los Blancos in 2022 but only arrived in 2024 once he turned 18 for £52million. He has already made multiple appearances for his senior national side.",
      "Despite holding such promise, Endrick has struggled to breach Xabi Alonso's frontline this season, which is no mean feat considering he is competing against Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior for a spot.",
      "The Sunday People claim that Endrick has informed his representatives that if he does not begin to play in the Spanish capital over the next few months then a January exit is on the cards.",
      "The report names United as an interested party and if a deal, whether it be a loan or a permanent one, is sealed then Endrick could slot into Amorim's centre-forward position.",
      "The 19-year-old is creative enough to drop deeper when needed and allow his forward partners to venture ahead of him and could play a similar role to the one Matheus Cunha adopted against Liverpool.",
      "By not giving Arne Slot's centre-backs a forward to mark closely, as they could have done with potential focal point Benjamin Sesko, United strung Liverpool's defense out with Cunha's versatile positioning. If Endrick does arrive then Sesko could be used in his place when it suits or make an impact off the bench if a more route-one approach is necessary.",
      "Cunha impressed against Liverpool and admitted he is versatile and willing to play wherever he is positioned. Already for United, the £62.5m signing has operated as a centre-forward and a No. 10. In this dream frontline he will drop slightly deep on the right.",
      "Amorim usually plays with Bryan Mbeumo on the right, with Cunha on the left dropping deeper and allowing the other wide forward to almost play alongside a striker.",
      "But in this instance these positions are flipped and a more out-and-out winger who often drifts wide will operate on the left with Cunha in place to the right of fellow Brazilian Endrick. Cunha has played in this position before for Wolves.",
      "Not only will this add a dash of chemistry as Cunha and Endrick have played together for their national side but it also strengthens both flanks. At present, Amad and Mbeumo operate on the right, with either Diogo Dalot or Patrick Dorgu joining Cunha on the left.",
      "If these are flipped we would see Cunha and Amad gel together down one side, which could work better considering Mbeumo and the Ivorian are perhaps too similar. A new superstar winger could then impress on the left, with a more defensive wing-back providing cover.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is one of the Premier League's most inform talents. He has bagged six goals already this term and is lightning down the left wing, which has sparked transfer rumours. It is estimated he could cost upwards of £75m.",
      "United have been one name mentioned should Semenyo leave the Cherries and in this scenario he is recruited to give United a potent threat out left. A front three of Endrick, Cunha and Semenyo allows for more balance across both sides of the pitch.",
      "The more defensive wing-back can back up Semenyo, whereas Amad can feel free to maraud forward with Cunha operating relatively deep. It must be said that ousting Mbeumo from the starting XI after he's impressed since his £65m move from Brentford this summer is rather unthinkable.",
      "But if Semenyo is an option then it's a relative no-brainer that one of the Premier League's finest attacking talents be given a starting spot. Mbeumo could see minutes from the bench much like Sesko and Amorim could adapt his front three for certain fixtures where say a wider threat on the right is more suited.",

      "Manchester United supporters have had too many disappointing journeys home on the M62 in the last decade but not on Sunday night.",
      "The Reds were good value for their 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. Bryan Mbeumo set the tone early as he fired home thanks to an excellent Amad through ball. Cody Gakpo hit the post twice in the first half and again in the second before his luck eventually turned. He scored from close range to level proceedings and the momentum looked to have turned.",
      "But up stepped Harry Maguire. He rose highest at the back stick to divert Bruno Fernandes' cross in and spark jubilant scenes in the away end.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Maguire reaction speaks volumes",
      "The long-lasting image in the minds of United fans after that victory will be of Maguire with his arms aloft being adored by the travelling contingent. However, a more important image was the centre-back repeatedly thumping the badge after the game.",
      "For too long United have been accused of having some players in their ranks who don't show the commitment expected of the fans. Maguire isn't one of those players and the Reds should ensure that a new contract is prepared for him.",
      "Slot confusion",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, Ruben Amorim mastered Arne Slot before a ball was even kicked. There were a couple of positions up for grabs heading into the game but few thought that Benjamin Sesko would be dropped.",
      "The decision even caught Slot by surprise as shown in his pre-match interview. He was left guessing when asked how United would line up in the forward area and that confusion paid dividends inside two minutes as the Reds scored on their first attack.",
      "Schmeichel transfers his powers",
      "As United's players exited the team bus at Anfield, Senne Lammens was greeted by Peter Schmeichel who gave the Belgian a big hug.",
      "Lammens oozed confidence between the sticks and he was not worn down by the intimidating atmosphere at Anfield. Amorim said the goalkeeper was not Schmeichel yet but the away end reinvigorated that chant again in the first half when he stood up to Alexander Isak and made a huge save.",
      "Two legends",
      "It was a blood-and-thunder atmosphere at Anfield and there was no love lost on the pitch. But in the stands, two club legends managed to move rivalries to one side to enjoy some Chocolate Buttons.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Kenny Dalglish shared a snack at half-time. Whether Ferguson would have shared his chocolate if United were losing at the break, we will never know.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that Manchester United summer signing Bryan Mbeumo has 'proved him wrong' after his £71million move from Brentford.",
      "Mbeumo was one of United's biggest signings before the 2025/26 season. After scoring 20 Premier League goals last term, the 26-year-old joined Ruben Amorim's side after weeks of negotiations.",
      "So far, Mbeumo has scored two Premier League goals for United and he was on the scoresheet in Sunday's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The forward latched onto Amad's through ball inside the first minute before beating Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "Cody Gakpo drew the Premier League champions level in the 78th minute before Harry Maguire netted a winner to earn United their first victory at Anfield in nearly 10 years.",
      "Previously, Rooney admitted he was 'sceptical' of Mbeumo's ability to thrive at Old Trafford. But after being one of Amorim's most dangerous players, the former United striker has admitted he has been proven wrong.",
      "\"For me he [Mbuemo] has been Manchester United's standout players this season and he hasn't got his rewards for his hard work and the sacrifices he's made for the team,\" he said on his BBC Podcast.",
      "\"It was a great goal. I'll be honest I was a bit sceptical when United signed him, I don't know if he had the ability to come and play for Manchester United, but he's proved me wrong.",
      "\"I think he's been a great addition to the team and by far United's best player of the season.\"",
      "Rooney also heaped praise on Amorim after he recorded back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time since replacing Erik ten Hag last November. \"It's such a huge win for the manager,\" he added.",

      "A statement from the force read: \"Lancashire Police are aware of an alleged incident involving a Burnley player during the second half of the Premier League game between Burnley and Leeds United at Turf Moor on Saturday 18th October. We are currently working with Burnley Football Club to establish the facts.\"",
      "Burnley have not commented on the matter, while Leeds are aware of the allegations. Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes that if the former United man is found to have spat at Leeds fans, then he will face a minimum suspension of three games from the FA.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’ and could become a transfer target for West Ham in January, according to reports.",
      "Zirkzee joined Man Utd from Bologna for around £37million in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "Despite joining with huge potential after costing more than his £34m release clause, the Netherlands international has struggled to adapt to Premier League football.",
      "He played 49 times across all competitions for the Red Devils in 2024/25, registering seven goals and three assists.",
      "One of Zirkzee’s biggest problems is where he fits on the pitch. Nobody seems to know what his best position is, and there appears to be no place for him in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "There was potential for Zirkzee to thrive as one of Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, but so far this season, he’s only made four appearances and is yet to start a match.",
      "Amorim clearly doesn’t rate him, with new signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko comfortably ahead in the attacking pecking order.",
      "Mason Mount has also been preferred in attack this season and started away to Liverpool on Sunday, while Zirkzee was an unused substitute for the fifth time in the Premier League this campaign.",
      "Considering that Zirkzee has been in every matchday squad this season, Amorim might be reluctant to lose the attacking depth he provides, but you can’t blame the player if he wants to leave the club.",
      "The 24-year-old has been linked with a return to Italy pretty much ever since he joined Man Utd, and that is still an option for him.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham could make Zirkzee a target in January as new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo wants at least three new signings when the transfer window reopens, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Indeed, the report states that Nuno is demanding a new striker be signed in the winter window, with Zirkzee a ‘potential option’.",
      "It’s claimed that Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’, with AS Roma one of several Serie A clubs interested in the ex-Bologna striker.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has made it clear to the West Ham hierarchy that he needs at least three new signings in January, including a striker.",
      "One potential option is Manchester United outcast Joshua Zirkzee, who is desperate to leave Old Trafford.",
      "West Ham would face competition for Zirkzee from clubs in Italy, including Roma, who would consider terminating misfiring Evan Ferguson’s loan from Brighton to bring in a replacement.",

      "Liverpool have endured a rocky start to their Premier League title defence, losing their last three matches to Manchester United, Chelsea and Crystal Palace.",
      "They had won five out of five to begin the campaign but were criticised for their defensive disorganisation — and for relying on late goals to get over the line.",
      "Arne Slot’s side have looked shaky at the back all season, with Ibrahima Konate, Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong among those in the firing line.",
      "Having spent over £400million in the summer transfer window after winning the league, Liverpool now have a target on their back, and their new players are being heavily scrutinised.",
      "Kerkez and Frimpong cost a combined £75m and are yet to convince, while £100m+ signings Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak look well off the pace required — with the former even dropped to the bench in recent weeks.",
      "MORE ON LIVERPOOL ON F365\n👉 Salah, Van Dijk lead 10 Liverpool players experiencing worrying slumps this season\n👉 Real Madrid ‘make move’ for Liverpool starter but Arne Slot has ‘elite’ transfer plan\n👉 Mikel Arteta only third in Premier League manager rankings for 25/26",
      "One shining light has been the form of £69m addition Hugo Ekitike, who has been tasked with competing with Isak for the No.9 role in Slot’s starting XI.",
      "While most of the new faces are still adjusting, Salah — who scored 29 goals and made 18 assists in the Premier League last season — has been nowhere near his 2024/25 level.",
      "The 33-year-old has only registered three goals and three assists in 11 appearances across all competitions this term, and in Sunday’s home defeat to Manchester United, Frimpong offered more threat on the right wing in five minutes off the bench than the Egyptian did in 85 minutes.",
      "Salah signed a new two-year contract in April to end months of speculation, but his form has dipped since then, and rumours regarding a long-term successor have intensified.",
      "One option for Liverpool is reportedly Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo, who has started the season in electric form, scoring six goals in eight games after signing a new deal at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "Semenyo was strongly linked with Tottenham and Manchester United in the summer but surprised many by committing his future to the Cherries.",
      "However, the i Paper says Liverpool are ‘considering’ bidding for the Ghanaian in the winter transfer window ‘as the pressure increases on out-of-form Mohamed Salah’.",

      "Importantly, Salah will be away at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, while Ghana will not be competing — adding to the intrigue around a possible move.",
      "Bournemouth included a release clause in Semenyo’s new contract, and while those terms are ‘not clear’, the Reds are ‘tempted’ by the proposition of triggering the option believed to be in the region of £75m.",
      "The report adds that Man United and Spurs both remain interested in Semenyo, who Bournemouth are ‘desperate’ to keep until the end of the season.",

      "It’s an overdue return for the Premier League manager rankings.",
      "We had planned to do them during the international break, but decided to be silly and lean into the at-the-time topical narrative of CRISIS and who was in CRISIS and who wasn’t in CRISIS and for those teams who were in CRISIS just how big of a CRISIS it was.",
      "Now, though, managers are once again the order of the day so in we go. And there are already just far too many of these lads. We know we’re a few weeks later than normal getting this up and running, but there really shouldn’t already be a club with three permanent appointments in the list or one manager whose second job of the season is already in danger.",
      "It all feels like this Premier League season is already just a bit too silly. It’s all a bit too much like that Tintin meme.",
      "‘What a season, eh?’",
      "‘Captain, it’s October.’",
      "Right, enough messing about. Let’s get on with it, because there is quite simply an awful lot to get through already.",
      "",
      "Mate. Just…mate. Possibly the worst managerial reign in the entire history of the Premier League, and that is some shout. It’s certainly the shortest.",
      "Look, we sort of get it, we do. We get why he took the job. He probably did need to move fast to get back in the Premier League, try and convince someone to take a punt on him while those memories of Europa League glory were fresh enough in everyone’s minds to stop them thinking too long or too hard about the sheer ridiculousness of taking Spurs to 17th in the league.",
      "It’s asking a huge amount to say Postecoglou should have turned down a job that got him straight back into the European competition where he’d just had such spectacular success.",
      "But…he should have turned down that job. Obviously he should. It went wrong in all the ways everyone knew it would go wrong, except at about five times the pace. There were, even among those truly cataclysmically awful results, flashes of what makes Angeball so beguiling. There were some lovely moves and stunning goals.",
      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",
      "It was always just so obviously asking too much of both Postecoglou and Forest’s players to make such a seismic shift in approach work without any kind of pre-season to bring in the right players and get everyone to understand the process.",
      "Postecoglou will walk away with a nice pay-off for barely a month’s work, but with his reputation in tatters. It is only five months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",
      "There must have been better options with just a bit more patience. But still we’re kind of glad he did it, because Nuno to Ange to Dyche in barely five weeks is something the like of which will never be seen again.",
      "",
      "Got absolutely none of the help he needed from the club in the summer, which meant all the talk during the late-season struggles last term about not judging Potter until he had his own players and a full pre-season to instil his methods became instantly moot.",
      "But while Potter was not and is not the primary source of West Ham’s travails, let’s also not pretend he is blameless. West Ham didn’t help him, but he didn’t help himself either, and a once-promising career suffered another huge step back.",
      "We’ll admit we didn’t really know how or where the road to recovery might begin for Potter, but will cheerfully admit we didn’t have ‘Simply be almost immediately named manager of Sweden’ high on our list.",
      "That admittedly incredible run of promotions with Ostersund is still evidently highly thought of in a country that has had an absolute catastrof*ck of a World Cup qualifying campaign but one that still has enormous potential for absurd redemption with their Nations League success meaning they’ll still be in the play-offs despite the likelihood now of finishing actual last in their qualifying group.",
      "",
      "Already enjoying one of the most spectacular early seasons of any Premier League manager. And remember this is a bloke who rocked up at Tottenham, won his first three Premier League games (including an opening-day win over Manchester City) and still ended up out on his ear by November.",
      "He knows a thing or two about early-season managerial shenanigans.",
      "But surely nothing quite likes this. There are still 10 days of October to go and Nuno stands on the very brink of being sacked for a second time.",
      "During these first two months of the season he has already watched his Nottingham Forest side tear Brentford to shreds, then watch his Nottingham Forest side be torn to shreds by West Ham, and then watch his West Ham side be torn to shreds by Brentford.",
      "It’s not normal, this. Presumably it’ll be Ange in by Christmas for the not-so-happy Hammers.",
      "READ: Nuno sack and West Ham relegation would make double history after ‘f***ing stupid’ decision",
      "",
      "We worried it would happen right back in May when that brilliant run of six straight wins that secured Premier League survival for Wolves was followed by three defeats and a draw in their four remaining games.",
      "We worried even more it would happen when key players were picked off by the Manchester giants with inadequate replacements coming in.",
      "And now it has happened. Wolves, a club where a ropey finish to one season always seems to bleed effortlessly into a terrible start to the following season have made a terrible start. Not even Dr Tottenham at his most inexplicably hospitable was able to find a complete cure for Wolves’ ills.",
      "We’re not actually worried about Wolves. They’ll be fine in the end. They always are. They’ll be 14th when the music stops in May and the very idea they were in quite serious relegation bother will appear vaguely silly.",
      "But we do worry about Pereira. By that point, he will likely have been out of the picture for a good six months. If Dr Tottenham doesn’t quite do the trick, the only option left is often a managerectomy. Right now he’s the sack race favourite.",
      "",
      "Fell out with everyone, which given who that ‘everyone’ is at Nottingham Forest is kind of understandable. But f*ck, what a waste. Didn’t get the chance to follow through on the brilliant work he did last season and was the first manager out of a job in the Premier League this season.",
      "Despite that, his volatile, anger-filled few weeks at Forest are still probably his best weeks of the season. Because his punishment for the end of his Forest reign has been severe indeed. Surely not even Mr Marinakis would have wished the West Ham job on his new worst enemy.",
      "",
      "It’s not been disastrous – and that really is something, because Farke’s overall record in this division after storming to promotion absolutely is disastrous – but it’s not been great either and there are significant grounds for concern after defeats either side of the international break.",
      "Losing narrowly to Spurs in a game that could have gone either way was no cause for great alarm, but the abject nature of last weekend’s defeat at Burnley in what was a real chance to plunge them into serious trouble while putting significant distance between themselves and the bottom three was ropey as all hell.",
      "Farke does have legitimate grievances about the big-talking Leeds hierarchy’s utter failure to provide him with the firepower he wanted and clearly needed. And if this season does go wrong for Leeds and Farke it will be the lack of threat in front of goal that will be the main contributing factor.",
      "Only the current bottom three have scored fewer goals than Leeds this season, but it does also need mentioning that they – along with Burnley – are also three of the only four teams to have conceded more.",
      "Farke might not be able to perform alchemy with the attacking players he has available between now and January, but he has to find some way to make the defence more secure.",
      "",
      "That statement win at Anfield has clearly changed the landscape for Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "For the first time since the very earliest days of his United reign, back in the far-off dim and distant days of late 2024 where his biggest problem was Ed Sheeran gatecrashing post-match interviews for some reason, Amorim has one precious gift: time.",
      "For the first time all season he is not among the most conspicuously under-pressure managers, and not solely because all the other under-pressure managers have been sacked.",
      "And even the league table now looks so much less appalling. It was easy, and fun, to joke about previous Man United corner-turning victories lifting them all the way to, say, 10th. But while they do remain in mid-table, that mid-table has become incredibly congested thanks to the weekend’s results at Anfield and elsewhere.",
      "Ninth place is still historically bad for Manchester United in the Premier League, but three points behind second place sounds a lot better.",
      "But let’s not lose the run of ourselves. Let’s not pretend all in the garden is suddenly rosy. Even United’s two big wins this season, against Chelsea and now Liverpool, have owed a great deal to their opponents doing some really very daft things indeed.",
      "And, while Liverpool were undeniably worryingly weird and so very rattled against United, on another day that was still a game that even a hyperactive and panicking Liverpool win with something to spare. Cody Gakpo could have won it on his own, having hit the woodwork three times, scored and then headed wide when a second equaliser looked a certainty.",
      "So no, let’s not pretend that finally, after almost a year in the job, Amorim winning two games in a row means something is definitely happening here.",
      "But what it does mean is that Amorim and the rest of us now at least have a much better chance of finding out for sure.",
      "",
      "Testament to the work Silva has done over several years now at Fulham that three straight defeats haven’t caused much of a ripple at all. Not quite sure a fourth straight loss at Newcastle will be quite so easily explained away, even if it is yet another in a difficult run, and it might just shift Silva away from the prominent positions he’s started to take in the various next manager markets.",
      "That might be no bad thing, because unless Fulham go completely stupid and sack him – and a new contract still seems like a far more likely outcome than that – it just means a longer stay at Craven Cottage.",
      "And we are increasingly of the view that both Fulham and Silva are better for having each other and that any change in that would go badly for both parties.",
      "",
      "Hmm. Not going well, is it? That’s now four straight defeats for Liverpool in all competitions, and do you know which other Premier League clubs have lost four straight games in all competitions this season? That’s right, none of them. That is awkward.",
      "We’d been pretty glib about the Liverpool Crisis before Sunday. They were no more in crisis after a couple of late defeats than they were cruising to inevitable all-competition glory after some late wins. Neither felt like they were particularly sustainable, neither felt like they could be extrapolated so easily to mean all that much for a season as a whole.",
      "But there really was something about the specific madness of that performance against Manchester United that freaks us right out. The panic. The confusion. The playing the entire second half as if there were 30 seconds remaining.",
      "This was a team and manager that had come under a bit of pressure and a bit of scrutiny and allowed themselves to be rattled into the shadow realm by Harry Maguire.",
      "Slot complaining about Man United’s squad rotation as if it were some kind of nefarious dark art is not the kind of thing you want to be hearing. Certainly not from a manager facing a tiny bit of pressure and unwanted attention for the very first time in Our League.",
      "Couple more defeats and he’ll be calling corners despicable and declaring war on throw-ins. Could he even be in actual danger?",
      "",
      "An awkward, distracted and disjointed summer has given way to an awkward, distracted and disjointed season. Our favourite little detail about Newcastle’s Premier League season thus far is that they’ve not had the same result two games running, for either good or bad.",
      "The net result, though, is currently quite bad. Closer to the bottom three than the top seven is not the order of the day at all, no matter what injustice the club feels about not being able to just spend all of the money all of the time however they like.",
      "They’ve had a tough set of fixtures, for sure, but they should be doing better than this.",
      "Greater reasons for positivity can be found in the Champions League, mind, where they were only undone in a good game by a couple of moments of Marcus Rashford magic, before making a full mockery of their Premier League inconsistency by being very consistent indeed and winning their next two games in the competition 4-0 and 3-0.",
      "The weekend’s game against Fulham feels really quite hefty for early season perceptions. Whoever wins is safely back among the mid-table peloton. Whoever loses is down among the stragglers and the strugglers.",
      "",
      "We feared for him, we really did. Villa’s much-discussed fondness for sailing close to the PSR wind and boasting wildly unsustainable wage-to-turnover ratios makes them the very last club that could afford – in sporting and financial senses – to miss out on Champions League football as cruelly as they did at the back end of last season.",
      "It definitely leaked into this campaign, but there is now some pretty solid evidence that they have escaped from the funk, and burgling a first away league win of the season at sleepy Spurs cements it. After five winless games had you wondering whether the quite brilliant Emery revolution at Villa might be coming to a swift and sticky end, they’ve now won five games in a row with that number likely to be six after this week’s Europa League trip to Go Ahead Eagles.",
      "Never underestimate the power of the Europa League to influence the early-season mood of its competitor clubs for both good or ill. The (relative) ease and (relative) lack of pressure on those games can do all sorts of wondrous things to free players and managers up and get a season up and running, and there’s no doubt it has massively helped Villa already.",
      "Or, of course, you can be Nottingham Forest. Which is not the recommended approach.",
      "The Europa League also presents Villa with a wonderful opportunity to end what is now, after last season’s successes for Newcastle and Spurs, comfortably the silliest ongoing trophy drought in English football.",
      "",
      "Flawless mid-table behaviour from Brighton so far. In the space of just eight games this season they’ve already beaten three of last season’s top five in Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "And where has this got them? Tenth. It’s got them to tenth.",
      "Now sure, it’s a congested mid-table area where they are also only three points behind third, but that only adds to the fun of it, along with the fact those three wins against last season’s top five are in fact Brighton’s only wins this season.",
      "Which also means, in a weird way, that if Manchester United really are back, back, back, then the absolute best way for them to prove it is to lose at home to the Seagulls this weekend.",
      "",
      "Could there be a more perfect job at a more perfect time for the great anti-woke firefighter?",
      "There are two perfect scenarios for Dyche to come in to a club and unleash his Brexitball. Either a club that is thoroughly aware of its limitations, or one paying the ultimate price for being entirely unaware of them.",
      "Nottingham Forest and their main-character owner deluded themselves into the deeply dangerous belief that one thoroughly competent season playing rigidly defined and expertly trained counter-attacking football in a season when so many big teams were just awful had elevated them into the elite.",
      "That they were now a club that could dare to dream big and face no consequences should the heat of the Barclays sun prove too much for their new and hastily glued wings.",
      "They have now discovered that was very much not the case.",
      "You only appoint Ange Postecoglou, with his recent Premier League record of just losing almost all of the games all of the time, if you have kidded yourself relegation is not something you have to think about.",
      "And you only appoint Dyche if you’ve realised that relegation is now the only thing you have to think about.",
      "Forest are the most perfect example of the second kind of Dyche club we can possibly imagine. As such, it is actually a very decent appointment. It’s a smaller, quieter, chastened Forest that Dyche enters than the one Nuno left just a few short weeks ago, but one that is therefore more malleable. More open to what must be done.",
      "You will have gruel-and-gravel Brexitball, and you will enjoy it. Or at least accept and appreciate its necessity.",
      "The other thing that’s just great for Dyche is that it should absolutely work a treat too. In the round, Forest have bollocksed this up. Dyche is not as good a manager as Nuno. He is even less subtle in his methods. He is a downgrade from the manager Forest had at the start of the season, but he is of the same school.",
      "And thus a much better fit than his immediate predecessor for the profile of squad he will inherit. Because it really is a very good squad indeed, and one that absolutely need not be in any of the sort of strife in which it finds itself.",
      "The low-block-and-counter might not be quite so effective for Dyche this season as it was for Nuno last, but it should be plenty effective enough to quickly steer Forest away from their current self-inflicted Angeball-delusion relegation fight.",
      "Dyche will get Forest organised and efficient once more. He will prioritise what they are good at, which we already know thoroughly aligns with what he wants his teams to be good at. We saw it work time and again last season, and it will work time and again this.",
      "We are beyond confident that Chris Wood goals in p*ss-boiling xG-spiting draws and wins will once again soon become the norm at the City Ground.",
      "Forest will once again return to being one of the hardest teams to play against instead of the softest and easiest.",
      "This is a club that has taken its medicine and should feel the benefit, but it is Dyche who emerges the clear winner here. He won’t be able to keep the smile off his disc-bearded face.",
      "He has everything he could possibly want. A squad of very good players who are perfectly suited to playing his specific brand of football to an extremely high level, yet at a club where the humblings of recent months mean there will not be any quickly declared desire for anything more.",
      "This is a club that got high on the smell of its own farts and is now choking. They don’t need crisp, crystal-clear filtered air to breathe. They just need something that isn’t their own farts.",
      "",
      "Not sure what we make of Chelsea. They have been, at times this season, almost unforgivably stupid and it’s always hard to imagine that kind of thing doesn’t come in some way or another from the manager. The Manchester United game was incredibly stupid.",
      "They were quite stupid against Forest as well, albeit that in the end they couldn’t quite compete with Forest’s stratospheric levels. Few could, which was why Ange Postecoglou had to go just to try and make it fair on other teams who wanted to try and be stupid.",
      "Hats off to Malo Gusto, mind, for never losing belief that Chelsea could still emerge as the most stupid on the day long after that ship had sailed.",
      "Enzo Maresca has been Chelsea boss for over a year now, which is no mean achievement in its own right. He’s taken them to the Champions League, won the Europa Carabao and been crowned quite literal champion of the world at the Trump World Cup.",
      "And yet when we ask ourselves the most simple and straightforward questions – Is Maresca actually good? Are Chelsea? – we still find that we really don’t know. Which we suppose is kind of inevitable when you stop running a football club as a football club.",
      "",
      "‘Outside the bottom three after eight games’ is surely a position Parker and Burnley would have taken before a ball was kicked, especially given the nature of those eight games.",
      "In fact, given Parker’s previous record in this competition and the fact those first eight league games have included Tottenham, Man United, Liverpool, Man City and Aston Villa, he’d have probably settled for just still being in a job at this point. As it is, he’s barely even an also-ran in the Sack Race at this point.",
      "Burnley have duly lost all five of those games mentioned above, but only at Spurs on the opening day and City last month have they been conspicuously second best. Both Man United and Liverpool needed late, late penalties to beat them, and Villa were given a late scare at Villa Park.",
      "What Burnley have done so far is secure points against their more direct rivals. They’ve already beaten both their fellow promoted clubs and taken a point off Nottingham Forest that at this time we really don’t know is any good or not.",
      "At some point Parker and his team really will have to work out a way to beat teams that were already in the Premier League before this year, but in fairness he hasn’t had many good chances. Games against Wolves and West Ham before the international break are definitely good chances. Arsenal perhaps not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But what we do sense at Spurs is a vital and widespread uncertainty. A distinct lack of purpose. We don’t know what the goal is for Spurs this season after finally sorting out the silverware albatross. And we’re not too sure they – or Frank – really know either.",
      "This is a new team and new manager trying to build a relationship with each other and the fans, for whom the last major tie with the ups and downs of the eventful last decade has been severed with the departure of Son Heung-min.",
      "Spurs are a club now in search of new heroes and favourites, on the pitch and in the dugout, and it all just feels a bit directionless. Frank is a good coach, obviously, and there have been enough signs that in the right – and often that appears to be the most theoretically taxing – conditions his Spurs team could also be very good indeed.",
      "But they can also be thoroughly apathetic and entirely maddening. One could thus argue, if one were so inclined, that this is in fact already far more Spurs than has perhaps yet been realised.",

      "It’s all going well enough right now, but Everton are one of several clubs in the big mid-table hump for whom this still feels very much like a season that could break in either direction as they sit four points away from both third and 17th.",
      "",
      "For varied and obvious and entirely understandable reasons, the Premier League manager discourse is currently dominated by a few names. Your Slots, Your Artetas, Your Amorims. The Sean Dyches of this world.",
      "But it occurs to us that there is currently very little being said about Pep Guardiola, and we find that quite interesting.",
      "Because this is a pretty crucial juncture in the Premier League career of one of Our League’s greatest managers. And we think he might just be starting to enjoy himself again.",
      "We’re pretty sure he didn’t really enjoy last season very much. You could see it on his face, sometimes viscerally and literally. A man used to competing for – and very often winning – the very biggest trophies was suddenly not doing that.",
      "Man City’s bids for a fifth straight Premier League crown and a second Champions League title were barely perceptible. The former disappeared in an astonishingly miserable run of form last autumn, one that also caused damage to the latter that proved to be unrecoverable.",
      "We spent a lot of last season wondering whether he might in fact walk away from City altogether, whether he any longer had the energy or desire to keep pushing himself and his players to go again in pursuit of yet more tin.",
      "Having watched his great rival Jurgen Klopp walk away from Liverpool due to possessing sufficient self-awareness and self-knowledge to know he just didn’t have another rebuild in him, would Guardiola be thinking in anything like the same way? We’re certain the thought at least crossed his mind, especially with Klopp clearly very much enjoying his less intensely and demandingly stressful Red Bull role so much.",
      "And despite his new contract, those thoughts resurfaced when City made a stuttering start this season, with consecutive and quite alarmingly tame early defeats to Spurs and Brighton hinting at another season in transition, a season building the foundations for something new rather than competing at the very top level.",
      "Could Guardiola really be arsed with all that? Building a new team to one day go against Arne Slot seemingly finding the Premier League embarrassingly easy, or whatever phase Arteta Arsenal are now in? What about right now?",
      "That’s all shifted a bit, though. City have been very good since the Brighton game and, with Liverpool/Slot losing the entire run of themselves over recent weeks it is once again Guardiola and his side who have emerged from the chaos looking the likelier challengers for a currently dominant Arsenal.",
      "And we know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Guardiola. It might just do so again. And we also don’t have to worry about just how much of an achievement Guardiola would consider it were City able to come out on top once again in that particular title battle.",
      "This new slightly more direct Haaland-centric, post-De Bruyne City shows tantalising signs of capturing Guardiola’s imagination in a way nothing really did last season.",
      "When you’ve achieved what Guardiola has achieved it must be unbelievably hard to keep coming back and putting yourself through it all again.",
      "This season suddenly looks to be playing out in just the way to get his blood up. The combination of the revitalising change in his own team’s methods and the familiarity of their direct rival might just be ideal.",
      "",
      "Still represents one of the most astonishing gambles a Premier League club has ever taken, the continuity candidate at a club that no longer had any of that, but three wins from the first eight games for a rookie manager suddenly in charge of a team that has lost its inspirational manager, most of his backroom staff, and players of the calibre of Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard is absolutely fine.",
      "They’re still scoring goals, which was the main worry. If Igor Thiago keeps up his current rate, Brentford will be fine. They’re the leading scorers in the bottom half of the table, and that’s a fair effort when you consider the resources Andrews has available and those he does not.",
      "There are lots of managers doing exceptional things at the Premier League’s smaller clubs, for want of a better word, but if Andrews negotiates this season keeping Brentford as far clear of the trapdoor as is currently the case, it will be as impressive as any of them.",
      "",
      "Feels like we could be just days away from the backlash. For when you have had your balls tickled and been told how brilliant you are as much and for as long as Glasner has, a backlash there must be.",
      "Very obviously an excellent manager, very obviously taking Palace to heights they really haven’t ever scaled before. But is there now, slightly awkwardly, just the slightest argument to be made they’re not doing quite as well this season as perhaps they ought?",
      "They’ve got the same number of Premier League wins as Brentford. They sit behind Sunderland in the table. We’re being very, very harsh here, but it feels like Glasner has done such things at Palace now that neither he nor they should be truly happy with sitting eighth in the table behind some conspicuously daft teams. They’re even being outperformed by Bournemouth as the division’s standout ‘punching above their weight with elite manager’ club.",
      "",
      "Mikel Arteta has now turned Arsenal into just about the least interesting team in the country, and this is almost entirely a compliment.",
      "They are now just exceptionally good at what they do, and it has provided them with a far more plausible, sustainable and coherent route to title success than previous Arteta phases have possessed and, even more importantly, than any of their potential (and largely wilting) rivals can lay claim to this season.",
      "The fact that Arsenal’s set-piece goals boil enough p*ss to solve the energy crisis is just a bonus.",
      "Because it’s Arsenal and because it’s Arteta, we still kind of expect a massive meltdown around January/February, with an FA Cup exit combined with a three-game winless Premier League run plunging them into a headloss crisis in which dark conspiracies are invoked and from which no recovery is possible.",
      "But that’s a triumph of experience over hope. This Arsenal side looks and feels different to Arteta’s previous efforts. Just their last three Premier League games provide compelling evidence of that. They’ve won at Newcastle and Fulham, while easing to a home win over West Ham.",
      "It might not seem too startling, until you consider that Arsenal contrived to collect but a single point from the same three games last season.",
      "They’re not even incurring as much wrath from the celebration police these days. This really should be the season they finally get over the line, at which point it probably will be a smart idea for everyone else to just switch off the internet for a month or so until the World Cup.",
      "READ: Arsenal are ‘boring’ and rely on set-pieces? Nope, they’re just really, really good",
      "",
      "Hands up who thought he and his team would be doing this well, with nary a thought of relegation or prominent Sack Race involvement to be seen?",
      "Put them down, you ridiculous liar.",
      "He’s been brilliant, they’ve been brilliant. And what Le Bris and Sunderland have done in these first eight games is in no small part responsible for the absolute panic currently going off at clubs around the league.",
      "The fact none of the promoted teams this year appear willing to meekly accept their designated role as cannon fodder is making several members of the Settled Seventeen nervous in a way they haven’t been in the last two seasons, but Sunderland are the main reason there are so many arses currently twitching so violently at your Wolveses, Forests and West Hams, and why even the Fulhams of this world no longer appear immune.",
      "",
      "He’s not just doing a good job. He’s doing one so good that we genuinely suspect it might actually be witchcraft. How, for instance, does a team of Bournemouth’s resources lose, in the space of one summer, defensive players of the calibre of Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez – not to mention their first-choice goalkeeper – and not just carry on regardless but actively improve?",
      "Something’s not right here. If anything for me, Clive, Iraola’s almost managing Bournemouth too well.",
      "We really are no more than two minor Arsenal setbacks away from asking whether Bournemouth can Do A Leicester in what we’re already confident Barclays scholars will come to consider the stupidest season since all the nonsense of 2015/16. Although last season is also right up there, now we think about it. This is the age of nonsense.",
      "But at Bournemouth, it is only the good kind of nonsense.",
      "Tell you what you don’t hear much of these days. People saying it’s an absolute disgrace for Bournemouth to have replaced Gary O’Neil with Iraola. That kind of chatter was all the rage for a while back there.",
      "Mikel Arteta is guaranteed to face four of the remaining few managers and clubs he has yet to beat with Arsenal. Can Barca not just appoint Chris Coleman?",
      "Arsenal are just like Wimbledon in the 1980s, because nothing could be more Wimbledon in the 1980s than a 4-0 Champions League win over Atletico Madrid.",
      "Arne Slot isn’t in danger really, is he? That’s presumably what these five elite managers thought when they won the title too…",
      "We know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Pep Guardiola. And it’s all absolutely on again.",
      "‘Arteta out’ is the cry from the sarcastic as a brilliant Gunners performance – especially from Martin Zubimendi – is hailed.",
      "Anthony Gordon is the perfect distillation of Eddie Howe’s Newcastle – and Jose Mourinho knows the Magpies have nailed a £100m transfer decision."

      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a potential exit from Man Utd over the past year as he has slipped in the pecking order at his boyhood club.",
      "The centre-midfielder enjoyed a brilliant breakout season in 2023/24 as he shone for Man Utd and England, but he suffered a major fall from grace in the following season due to a loss of form and his injury issues.",
      "The 20-year-old has also been negatively impacted by the appointment of head coach Ruben Amorim, who has favoured other players as his game time has been limited.",
      "In January 2025, it was reported that Man Utd were open to the pure profit sale of Mainoo, but he did not secure a move in the winter or this summer.",
      "READ: Actually, winners Manchester United had a better summer transfer window than losers Liverpool",
      "In the summer window, Mainoo submitted a request to leave on loan, but this was denied as Man Utd felt that they did not have appropriate cover.",
      "However, Mainoo’s situation has not changed in recent months and it is not out of the question that he leaves Man Utd in January.",
      "Serie A giants Napoli were among the clubs interested in Mainoo in the summer and a new report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims he is already ‘very close to finalising’ a move to the Italian side.",
      "According to the report, Man Utd are more willing to let him leave in the winter than in the summer, with the Premier League giants setting ‘favourable conditions’ for a transfer.",

      "The report adds:",
      "‘The terms of the deal will be crucial: United are demanding that the loan not include a buyout clause; Napoli, meanwhile, needs space in midfield to include him.",

      "A report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Mainoo’s ‘concerns are growing’ at Man Utd as he is ‘weighing up a loan move in January’.",

      "However, United went ahead in the second minute of the game and though Cody Gakpo equalised for Liverpool in the 78th minute, honours were only even for six minutes, before Harry Maguire secured the win for United with a header into the corner of the net.",

      "“I have to say, within a minute, that had gone because it was a brilliant moment for United, a really good bit of play from Amad [Diallo], slipping it into [Bryan] Mbeumo. And that just got them off on the right footing.”",
      "A look at the stats of the game suggests there was indeed reason for Neville and others to be cautious.",
      "Liverpool had more shots, more on target and much more of the ball. However, United sat back and played the ball long to get themselves out of trouble and transition from defence to attack.",
      "As a result, the Reds struggled to break them down and though they should have scored a second when Gakpo glanced a free header wide of an essentially open net, never managed to find the net again.",

      "Arsenal: Mikel Arteta – 2027\n“I feel extremely proud, very excited and am looking forward to what is coming next,” said Mikel Arteta in September 2024 as he signed a new three-year contract with the club. Will he see it out? This is surely the season to deliver a trophy…",

      "",
      "Bournemouth: Andoni Iraola – 2026\nGary O’Neil was axed and Iraola brought in with a more progressive style of football after his contract with Rayo Vallecano expired. He was handed a two-year contract, which seems sensible. Then he signed a contract extension at the end of his first season, which also seems sensible. Bournemouth are understandably keen to persuade the Spaniard to sign on again but Iraola is ambitious and many big European clubs will be circling.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Keith Andrews – 2028\nPerhaps mindful of making too many changes in the same summer Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard left, Brentford decided to appoint from within when giving set-piece coach Andrews his first chance sitting in the big chair.",

      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Oliver Glasner – 2026\nThis felt like something of a coup for Palace, who appointed Glasner to replace Roy Hodgson. They have since – very wisely – opened contract talks with the man who delivered their first trophy. There have been some “early conversations” about a new deal but there’s little doubt that the Austrian will have options.",
      "",
      "Everton: David Moyes – 2027\nDespite initial reports that Moyes would replace Sean Dyche on a short-term six-month contract, he has actually signed on for two-and-a-half years to take the club into their new era at a new stadium.",

Those terms were renegotiated in 2022 but neither the club nor Howe have been willing to elaborate on the length. “It’s a ‘long-term’ deal –  that was the wording, I think,” said Howe when asked directly.",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",

      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has ‘said yes’ to a £50m transfer as they look to sign one of five targets in January.",
      "The Red Devils have been very active in the transfer market in recent months. In the summer, they spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "These signings filled the void left by the departures of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony.",
      "With this, Man Utd appear to be in a stronger position than last season and Sunday’s 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield was their most important victory to date under Amorim.",
      "Still, Man Utd are short in certain positions and they are crying out for a new midfielder after they failed to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton in the summer.",
      "United were priced out of a move for Baleba in the summer as Brighton wanted more than £100m for their prized asset. Despite this, he remains an option heading into the January transfer window, while Crystal Palace standout Adam Wharton is another candidate.",
      "READ: Actually, winners Manchester United had a better summer transfer window than losers Liverpool",
      "Now, a report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Amorim has ‘said yes’ to a £50m transfer as he looks to reunite with Sporting Lisbon star Morten Hjulmand, who is their ‘prime target’.",
      "Hjulmand has a £70m release clause in his current contract, though Man Utd are ‘optimistic’ of signing him for £50m next year.",
      "United are also said to have four more targets in mind, including Wharton, Baleba, Jobe Bellingham and Victor Froholdt.",
      "Man Utd also need to work on contracts in the coming months, with centre-back Harry Maguire among those due to become a free agent in 2026.",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Man Utd have ‘made a huge decision’ on Maguire, with ex-Premier League chief scout Mick Brown “expecting them to offer him a new deal”.",
      "“Harry Maguire, as far as United are concerned, is a crucial player,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“He sets a standard every time he’s on the pitch, and I know he has his limitations, but who doesn’t?",
      "“His heading ability is so important at the back, because United don’t have other defenders willing to do the dirty work like he does, and it’s a massive threat at the other end.",
      "“If they weren’t already convinced of how important he is, they will be after that display against Liverpool.",
      "“Plus, it’s the stuff he does behind the scenes as well, they’ve got a lot of younger players at the club, especially in defence, and he’s an excellent influence and example for them.",
      "“In terms of his contract situation, I’m expecting them to offer him a new deal and from what I hear, he would be happy to stay if possible.",
      "“It’s something that’s now probably more likely than ever, and it’s hugely important they get it done.”",
      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has cleared up that he didn’t mean to be negative about Manchester United after the Reds’ defeat to them, telling Ruben Amorim he had a “very ...",
      "Has there ever been such a speedy fall from grace? Arne Slot is being destroyed by Liverpool fans and others.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "Harry Maguire’s redemption arc will be studied in years to come. Right now, it should the template for his manager and many of his Man Utd team-mates.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney insists that it’s “so important” that Harry Maguire makes the England squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. Of the ever-presents, only David Raya has conceded fewer goals.",
      "",
      "Henderson has risen to joint top in the ranking despite conceding three to Bournemouth. He has conceded two more goals in the last two games than the six matches beforehand.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. Though the PSxG stat won’t account for the way he gave Tottenham the ball before their crucial second at the Etihad in his home debut for his boyhood club.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced three shots more than any other goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "Only three keepers have made more saves this season. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic part of a completely revamped defence. Still, though, the Cherries sit in third in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award needs to be on his game this term with only Burnley allowing more shots on target than Forest, all while Big John breathes down his neck. Sean Dyche’s first job is to make his goalkeeper less active.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "Five clean sheets in seven games – the joint-best record in the Premier League – is keeping Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. He bumped his PSxG up against Arsenal, though that stat won’t highlight his mistake in giving Arsenal back the ball prior to their late winner.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a very solid start to life in the Premier League, with no one having yet seized upon the fact one of the world’s best keepers is supposed to be shaky on crosses with two left feet.",
      "",
      "No keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 83.3%. For the last two games, he need not have bothered with gloves since Arsenal deprived both Fulham and West Ham of a single shot on target.",
      "",
      "One of three keepers to keep out a penalty this season, Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as England’s No.1.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray. Given Liverpool’s struggles to keep a clean sheet, they need Alisson back sharpish. Giorgi Mamardashvili has only played two games (he needs one more to qualify for this list) but already he is on -1.3.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth have been expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Bournemouth’s first, from what should have been an impossibly-tight angle went through Leno but Justin Kluivert’s winner was unsaveable.",
      "",
      "It was handy while his side had forgotten how to score goals that Martinez was slowly making amends with Villa fans after a summer in which he flirted hard with Manchester United. Though the goal conceded to Burnley has given the Argentina star a negative number here after he got lured into a shoving match under a corner, his late movement allowing a save-able header to bounce through his legs.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",

      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim, apparently. Dropped for the wins over Sunderland and Liverpool, with Senne Lammens coming in to concede only once from a PSxG of 3.3. The Belgian would be third on this list but he will only qualify after facing Brighton on Saturday.",

      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 is not a good look on Darlow. Even if he and Perri together would not have stopped Burnley’s second.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have if we accept the Bees need some patience while a remodelled team settles under a new manager. Defeats – both 3-1 – at Forest and Fulham cost Kelleher here, with the Cottagers scoring three from an xG of 1.0. But saving Bruno Fernandes’ penalty certainly helped.",
      "",
      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal has done for the £16million new boy here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle. But five was two more than Arsenal ought to have scored at the Emirates, say the stats. Perri returned from injury to the bench but Farke has a decision to make before a huge game at home to West Ham.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",

      "Mikel Arteta is guaranteed to face four of the remaining few managers and clubs he has yet to beat with Arsenal. Can Barca not just appoint Chris Coleman?",

      "It’s an overdue return for the Premier League manager rankings in what is already a really quite mental season.",
      "Arne Slot isn’t in danger really, is he? That’s presumably what these five elite managers thought when they won the title too…",
      "We know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Pep Guardiola. And it’s all absolutely on again.",
      "‘Arteta out’ is the cry from the sarcastic as a brilliant Gunners performance – especially from Martin Zubimendi – is hailed."

      "",
      "Well Sunday was fun. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the game ahead of time. My most optimistic thoughts were suggesting that this was a good time to play Liverpool, but that United remain capable of fouling up any type of opportunity presented to them.",
      "Never in my wildest dreams did I think that every negative inkling of Liverpool I had over the summer would be on display so plainly for 90 minutes, or that they’d be in such a chaotic state of flux midway through October. I’m obviously delighted that United took advantage and got a win, but I don’t actually think they had to put on a storming display to manage that. It was a 7/10 from United – some good, some not so good. A more confident/capable team probably goes for the throat at 1-0 up and goes in at half-time 2 or 3 goals to the good.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "That said, it was nice to see a game plan in place from Amorim and a disciplined performance from the United players. Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens have been immediate upgrades on the dross they’ve replaced, and the performances across the board do feel slightly boosted from last season (not hard, but still). There’s a bit of spirit in the team – Sesko seemed genuinely delighted with the winner and the result, instead of sulking like the Rashfords and Sanchos of this world when he was benched. Those small differences can add up over time, and it’s much easier to get behind a team that looks to have a healthy quota of good eggs (special mention to De Ligt in that sense).",
      "But going back to the aforementioned negative inklings re: Liverpool, I thought the following were pretty indisputable:",
      "All the above borne in mind, I’d be starting to look at Slot too. He obviously has tonnes of credit in the bank, but that summer splurge looks misdirected at this stage and his excuses after the game were limp. Moaning about low blocks and long passes out to bypass the press is facile – you have to expect those things when you’re champions and playing at home. Not having any solution bar “chuck all the attackers on and pile forward” debunks a lot of the praise he got for his tactical flexibility last season. They did have chances to score more, but so did United. If you turn football into basketball, you’re playing with fire.",
      "Finally, it’s heartening to see the narrative for this season having flipped so dramatically in a month. From “mark of champions, league is done” when the issues were already clear and Liverpool were getting away with it, all the way to “deepening crisis, huge opening for Arsenal/City” in the space of 4 weeks that even included an international break. The truth is somewhere in the middle obviously, but seeing the usual early season knee-jerks being swiftly corrected is nice. Hopefully the remainder of the season provides as much intrigue.\nKeith Reilly",

      "…A few things that came to mind immediately after looking at that Liverpool line-up:",
      "– Why is Isak starting over Hugo Ekitike? – Because he’s an expensive signing\n– Why is Salah not dropped despite the loss of form? – Because he’s our “undroppable” HIGHEST PAID star player.\n– Why is Chiesa and Ngumoha still benched? – Because they are not expensive signings and Not Slot’s favourites.\n– Why does Konate start every game despite bad form? – Because Joe Gomez is not Slot’s favourite.",
      "And I haven’t even started from Wirtz or Frimpong yet.",
      "There is no plan, no tactics, midfield is invisible and a big mess.",
      "Defence is crumbling, good quality wingers and forwards are rotting on the bench.",
      "Ekitike and Chiesa did in 5 minutes what Isak and Salah couldn’t do in 90!",
      "It’s utterly frustrating!",
      "Slot is out of his depth and needs to fix these issues if he wants to avoid becoming a Brendan Rodgers type scammer!",
      "I can’t wait to see what Klopp will do with Isak, Frimpong, Cheisa, Ngumoha, Wirtz and his heavy metal!",
      "Bring it on!",
      "Till then we are stuck with Slot and his boring, identity-less football.\nTejas (Ekitike and Chiesa to start against Frankfurt)",
      "",
      "…Can those defending Slot not admit Liverpool are still 4th despite him, not because of him? The majority of wins were the result of individual brilliance, and nothing to do with his tactics or game plan. One half of decent football from 10 games is damning. The man has persisted with Salah, Mac Allister and Virgil/Konate (delete as applicable) when they’ve repeatedly stunk the place out, and made Szoboszlai at RB a thing, when you have two actual defenders in Gomez and Frimpong sat on the bench.",
      "He also lacks ‘de bolls’ to drop Salah and play both Ekitike and Isak. I don’t subscribe to the view that Liverpool spent £400m to bolster their squad, as they’ve a net loss on players after the transfer window. However, £200m was spent on two strikers who were supposed to be an improvement on what was already there. Yet here we are, with Salah being completely anonymous for 90 minutes yet again, and Gakpo missing more than he scores.",
      "Finally, post-game interviews have become a cringe-fest. Bemoaning the other teams’ tactics (case in point yesterday “they only played long balls”) after yet another poor performance is an embarrassment. Last season’s easy-going and honest (Dutch?) vibe has been replaced with snide and derogatory remarks about opponents, win, lose or draw. There’s obviously massive pressure on Slot, but a bit of self-awareness is needed.\nDF",
      "",
      "Very much enjoyed that win as a United fan.",
      "No doubt a lot of negativity on Slot right now after 4 defeats in a row, but I would also suggest that like for Amorim, a bit of patience is required.",
      "A lot of idiots like to throw around the sums spent and expect instant success. That’s not how it works. Players need to settle and get to know each other and fully understand what the manager wants. The team has changed a lot since the last year. They lost 3 big players in the team and bought in a whole load of new ones. And that’s not including even the tragic way one of those players left.",
      "Three games ago Liverpool were 5 points clear and the chatter was they were slam dunk to win the league. 4 games ago Amorim was an idiot whose formation would never work. Since then Liverpool lost 4 games in a row and United won 3 out of 4.",
      "Let’s see how it all unfolds over the season. For me this is a transition season for Liverpool where they will get top 4 but not win the title. They need new defenders like United need new midfielders to take the final step.\nNishul Saperia (Slot’s chips are down! No-one knows their slot in Slot’s team!)",
      "",
      "…Ruddy nora. Nowt as kneejerky as football fans is there?",
      "Said it once before, will say it repeatedly. Salah, VVD, et all are still coming to terms with the fact their mate died. Can we cut them a bit of slack in terms of performance?",
      "However, Diaz (even Darwin) worked their socks off at the top of the pitch. Isak and Salah don’t. Our work rate has plummeted and going for Isak as opposed to much needed defence and defensive midfield will ensure no league this year.",
      "When Diaz left I was worried, still am, for this season.However, this Liverpool team will be back for the league next year, and may even gel in time for a potential CL this season (PSG were poor at beginning last year before it clicked).",
      "LFC fans, try and relax, would much rather be in our position than any other team in the league.",
      "Oh, apart from Arsenal. They look legit superb.\nDavid (Let Utd win the occasional battle, we’ve won the war already #Amorinforeverin) Molby, Shrewsbury",
      "",
      "Slot said before the season that we won too many close games last year, so the plan internally was to reduce a bit of the control and seek to be a bit more attacking, which makes sense.",
      "I think a lot of the tactical issue was actually shown in the Everton game. Grav was super and bombed forward to great effect, but given the way we are currently set up we absolutely need someone sitting in that position in front of the back 4, and he’s the best person to do it. Having our 6 charging forward to join attacks is all well and good, but it’s leaving us far too open.",
      "Other aspects would be as mentioned previously here – let the fullbacks bomb forward, play a front two narrower with Wirtz behind.",
      "Ultimately, the results haven’t been great, but our last 3 games we’ve created 6.5 xG and scored 2 goals, while conceding 3.6xGA and 4 goals. We aren’t taking the chances we are conceding and, no matter what tactics you have, if you’re doing that you can’t expect many good things to happen.\nTom, London",
      "",
      "If Man United spent £100m on an attacker with what was the highest transfer in Prem history and he went 10 games without a goal or assist and got dropped for a massive game, would he not be called in the tabloids the Wirtz signing ever?",
      "Not saying he is a bad player and won’t come good. But we know if he was signed by United, there would be a massive pile on at the minute.\nPaul",
      "",
      "Bit surprised to see that this hasn’t been mentioned in any of the coverage anywhere following Liverpool’s abject humiliation at home by United yesterday, especially what with F365 being the sainted protectors of footballers’ and fans’ mental health, provided they don’t have different views on certain matters of course. The collective expectations of Liverpool this season have been massively overblown, the steep decline we are seeing was always far more likely – it’s the logical outcome of human beings being forced to work in a high pressure environment during a mental health crisis.",
      "I watched the Chelsea game back before the United one, and was struck not just by how every single Pool player was making basic mistakes that are normally coached out of players at school, but that the reaction to each and every snafu was the same vacant lost expression and resignation that nothing better could be expected. There didn’t seem to be any fight, nor fire in the belly to do themselves justice. It was the same yesterday – when Mo’s toe-punting it six feet past the upright and Gakpo’s heading it even further wide, both in the six yard box, the reactions were more performative than passionate. Mo normally smiles, knowing a goal is coming soon, especially against United – this time, a look to the heavens, almost close to tears.",
      "Slot’s completely lost his composure too – the analysis is spot on – he went full cuptard when there was plenty of the game to go. Previously, we would go a goal down and the reaction would be to step up the focus and intensity and eventually overpower and owerwhelm pretty much every opponent we faced. Now we shit the bed at the first sign of adversity, throw everybody forward and start finger-pointing and arm-waving that it is everybody’s fault but our own. No accountability, no sacrifice, no collective, no team. Slot’s deployment of the new signings has neutered them completely, while simultaneously making the established players demonstrably worse. Slot’s not waving, but drowning unfortunately.",
      "But these are elite players, some of the best in the world – winners of the biggest trophies. Slot is a proven winning coach – calm, authoritative, an excellent, effective decision maker. So what’s gone wrong?",
      "It’s got to be Jota. Football is a team game, the best teams win trophies, to get the best teams you need closeness and intimacy (fnarr) – absolute trust in the people you are in the trenches with, you have to do anything for the person next to you for mutual success – it should come as naturally as breathing. It’s more of a band of brothers than colleagues – everybody intensely focussed on the same goals, and the collective euphoria that follows achieving them. United looked like more of a team yesterday – more focussed, more together. Liverpool looked like they didn’t really want to be there, engulfed by triggers of tragic loss.",
      "Liverpool are reminded constantly of Jota’s passing – the space in the dressing room, the chant every 20 minutes of every game. Liverpool’s non-cunt (before this summer anyway) recruitment policy has resulted in a squad especially vulnerable to this situation. They are being forced out into the spotlight multiple times a week while they are still trying to process the loss of a friend, almost brother. The new players are trying to forge relationships with damaged human beings – it’s not easy. Losing a friend too soon (RIP Joycey, sorry you missed Spurs actually winning something) stays with you always – initially you are thinking about them, about what happened, constantly. Over time you think about them less, but it’s always there, like a cold blanket enveloping you or a dark undercurrent trying to pull you down. Imagine taking that with you onto the pitch under the bright lights and intense scrutiny, everybody expecting, no demanding you deliver, and abusing you when you just can’t.",
      "This isn’t an excuse, nor a plea for sympathy, but it does explain why the formerly faultless have reached a new nadir – why players can’t play a pass or shoot straight, why Slot can’t select the right players or make the right subs or pick the right tactics – they are all in a PTSD storm with no way out until the summer.",
      "So Liverpool won’t win anything this season, they were never going to – this season is all about repairing mental health, rebuilding confidence and trying to find some affinity with each other. It’s a real shame that Slot and the Big Virg won’t admit this publicly, as that would start the healing process, but I guess it must be impossible to do that in the macho football microcosm.\nGofezo (or maybe it is just because Slot looks exactly like a human glans)",
      "",
      "So Spurs lost on Sunday, to Aston Villa. For the third time in three games in 2025 as it happens, and for the sixth time in 8 games since Steven Gerrard left. A period where Thomas Frank has now lost 5 times and drawn twice in 7 games against Villa. And in which Villa have finished the season above the world’s most Ridiculously Entitled Football Club 3 times out of 3 (including last season obviously, when everyone else finished above REFC too).",
      "So maybe the media build-up to the game may have focused on what Spurs were going to have to focus on doing to beat an opponent they often struggle against? Maybe the commentary during the game would have suggested that the Daniel Levy Thunderdome Conference Centre ™ might have posh toilets but it is not actually a good place to play football; and if REFC concentrate on what the opposition can do, they might have more chance? Possibly the coverage after the game could have recognised that rather than going overboard on Spurs being sloppy and some amazing God from the machine moments from Villa, there could have been a glimmer of recognition that Villa are… just better?",
      "But no. Because of course, any of this would require club and media to get over themselves. When Conte and Mourinho and even Ange – Ange Postecoglou! – were explaining to the world that there is an attitude problem at James Maddison Football Club, did anyone listen? When Rio Ferdinand was banging on about Djed Spence – Djed Spence! – being the best one-on-one defender in England, we probably should have all been running to the bookmakers to put the house on Spurs conceding goals from the Spence zone. But will this be forgotten by the next time the England squad is announced? You bet it will. A Spurs player puts his shirt on the right way round and suddenly a star is born.",
      "Being ‘Spursy’ is not a thing. ‘Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory’ is not unique to Tottenham at all. Clubs good enough to win frequently, without access to the final 0.1% of quality to keep getting over the line regularly enough to be the best, are all in this position. What is unique to Tottenham is a colossal ego with absolutely nothing to back it up. But the results they get are normal. The performances and outcomes are all normal. If they attract new signings to the club because of the allure of London, they should not be surprised to have a lot of ‘injuries’. They are not cursed. There is no spell preventing the club from becoming Liverpool. Pretending they’re driving an F1 car when playing Mariokart will not result in success.",
      "And while I’m here, a quick note to everyone who should know better (I don’t know if Barney Ronay reads, or indeed is someone who should know better). Despite no input from WMP, Aston Villa, Jason Bourne or whoever else is apparently to blame, Maccabi Tel-Aviv’s game against Hapoel was cancelled this weekend after the lovely fans started riots with each other and the police.

The last time I went to that pub was 5 April, the day Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite being reduced to nine men. What odds that our next visit will end up being 14 March, the day Palace host Leeds United? That seems to have good madness potential.",
      "* As plenty of us have said before, there is something incredibly fun about supporting this particular Crystal Palace team. They just don’t know when they’re beaten and regardless of the opposition, will throw everything at getting back into the game, then go behind and do it again, before missing a glorious chance to actually win the thing. Some things never change. I can’t decide whether it feels harsh to criticise them for not stealing all three points, or if it’s actually justifiable because Oliver Glasner has raised expectations. The same applies to Jean-Philippe Mateta: he deserves a lot of praise for scoring a hat-trick, two of which were classic centre-forward goals and the other was a stoppage time penalty that required a lot of composure; however, having done all that, he was in the perfect position for another textbook centre-forward goal to win the match and couldn’t convert the chance. Incidentally, had he scored a fourth, he would have been the first Crystal Palace player to do so since Johnny Byrne in 1960, when the Glaziers (as they then were) played in Division Four.",
      "* Overall though a draw with a side as good as Bournemouth is a good result for Palace, particularly after their club record unbeaten run was ended last time out. Palace fans think we’ve come a long way but we’re far behind the Cherries on that front. Andoni Iraola has them playing good football with a sense of ambition towards the European places that is far more realistic than other recent occupants of the Bournemouth dugout. Had Iraola’s team won on Saturday, they would have very briefly gone top of the Premier League, something inconceivable for most of their history but the way they’re playing this season makes perfect sense – in that respect, a point for Palace is a good result.",
      "* The family I was visiting was my octogenarian father in law and his partner. Watching the lunchtime game and the fallout led to some predictable conversations, like “why do they have to have a woman commentating”, “you don’t see players with names like Smith and Jones anymore”, and “where are all the British managers”. My answers to those were that Lucy Ward is actually a good co-commentator, you support Liverpool, who have a midfielder called Jones, and that in what is broadly a meritocracy, the British managers they mean aren’t good enough anymore. As Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day, there are only 20 Premier League jobs at any given time, so when one becomes available there will always be a long line of candidates, even when the club is in as much disarray as Nottingham Forest. People from all over the world will apply, so it would be incredibly strange if the strongest candidate ended up being Sam Allardyce, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes or Alan Pardew.",
      "* A side effect of Forest’s decision to sack Ange Postecoglou was that MOTD viewers had to sit through Micah Richards trotting out some incredibly tired analysis of the situation. Postecoglu had eight games, none of which ended in a victory and for most of which his team were absolutely dire. Eight games isn’t very long, but if his ideas were going to take effect at all, there would have been some sign of it happening before now. Richards said managers need time, but the manager who needs the time is the one who has to come in and fix the mess caused by the owner’s handling of the previous two managers, both of whom drew unfortunate comparisons with Roy Hodgson: Nuno Espirito Santo because of how reluctant his team could be to attack, and Postecoglu because of his teams’ unfortunate habit of conceding soon after half time. I’ve no idea what he says to people but, like Hodgson at Palace, you wonder if he would have been better off saying absolutely nothing.",
      "* People really need to stop comparing the current Arsenal team to Tony Pulis’s Stoke City, at least until an opposing player has done something ridiculous in a panic trying not to concede a set piece opportunity. Think players conceding corners so they didn’t have to defend a Rory Delap long throw, that’s the bar.",
      "* Liverpool conceding goals because their defenders are ball-watching instead of tracking the players they’re supposed to be marking? I for one am shocked by this. Well, I might be if I hadn’t watched Liverpool regularly for the past few years and mentioning it on a regular basis. I don’t think they need to worry too much about losing to Manchester United. It seems like when United were challenging for the title (a long time ago now obviously), they would often lose to Liverpool, so it makes perfect sense that the same would be true the other way round.\nEd Quoththeraven",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been three Premier League wins in a row – with two in the Europa making it five in all – to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",

He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "It could definitely still all go wrong, but there’s more than enough encouragement and, more importantly, more than enough more obvious strife elsewhere to keep him safe in this market for now.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a sticky patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without.",

      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly swift evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams. Wolves next, which certainly provides an opportunity.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and on current form, no team is better against the best.",
      "While we still think what happened at Anfield owed more to Liverpool absolutely sh*tting the bed than United suddenly becoming good, it is still a statement win that absolutely buys Amorim time if nothing else. And with Brighton, Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a few weeks.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Was doing okay, but the performance and result at Burnley were both thoroughly miserable. It was a huge missed opportunity to put distance between themselves and the bottom three, and has darkened the Elland Road mood considerably.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

      "There is also no doubt that Hugo Ekitike has been a great buy as he’s comfortably been Liverpool’s best-performing summer signing, though this is where the positivity ends.",
      "Liverpool broke the British transfer record twice in the summer to sign Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, but each player has massively underdelivered this season.",
      "Isak is suffering a lasting effect of an inactive summer, and the Man Utd game, which Arne Slot said was the first to properly judge him, was another non-event for the former Newcastle United striker, who will inevitably come good even if it takes him a few months.",
      "It’s a similar story with Wirtz, who has at least shown in flashes what he is capable of, but he has not been put in the right positions to shine and is currently not doing enough to ease the scrutiny directed his way.",
      "More pressing concerns are at full-back, as highlighted as a “weakness” by Man Utd, because Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong have been nowhere near the level previously set by Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in those positions.",

      "Though Ibrahima Konate had one of his better games of this season against Man Utd, Liverpool’s failure to land Guehi has had a negative impact as Virgil van Dijk has been miles off it, thus ensuring that their defence is incredibly fragile.",
      "So, in this summer’s window, FSG were far from transfer masters and were actually pretty inept as they forced through too many changes in a single window, signed the wrong profile of player in certain positions and overlooked glaring weaknesses in other departments (i.e. at centre-back).",
      "Man Utd and INEOS, meanwhile, are currently coming out smelling of roses following the summer window.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, they are far from perfect; their failure to sign a No.6 continues to bite them as they were still too easy to play through against Liverpool and were fortunate not to be punished.",
      "There is also the situation of some of the ‘bomb squad’, obviously except Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, returning to form elsewhere, but they were dead weight at Old Trafford and INEOS were at least patient enough to secure straight fees/loan with obligation to buy deals for these players.",

      "In years to come, Harry Maguire’s redemption arc will be studied. More immediately, it should be used as the template for his manager and many of his Manchester United team-mates.",
      "Maguire added to his increasing catalogue of huge goals for United by heading in a late winner to seal the Red Devils’ first victory at Anfield since 2016. No player in the near-year Ruben Amorim has been in charge has come up clutch for the manager more than the 32-year-old.",
      "A winner at Anfield. Sparking bedlam when completing the comeback against Lyon. Another late header to beat his old club Leicester in the FA Cup. He almost dug Amorim out at Grimsby with a last-minute equaliser.",
      "Those are just the goals. A theme running through Amorim’s biggest victories is Maguire’s rock-solid presence at the back. In the manager’s first derby at the Etihad, Maguire pocketed Erling Haaland. At Arsenal, in the FA Cup, he was a outstanding. Twice now at Anfield for Amorim, the centre-back has been huge at both ends.",
      "Maguire has been talismanic for this manager, and considering the depths from which he has recovered, he more than anyone else is the example to follow in the United dressing room.",
      "The apologies are never as loud as the disrespect, or in Maguire’s case, criticism, mockery and abuse. But if those who vilified the defender queued up to give him his dues, the back of the line would stretch to Ghana and the constituency of MP Isaac Adongo.",
      "He was the politician who fired a cheap-shot from his nation’s parliament when Maguire was struggling for form. Yes, that’s putting it mildly. Maguire endured a truly wretched 2021-22, coinciding with his arrest on holiday in Greece. Maguire was a man down and the world relished in piling in to give him a kicking.",
      "At least Adongo went on the record to apologise to Maguire – ‘sorry’ isn’t as shareable on socials, though, is it? – who accepted with the grace and dignity he showed for the most part through a tortuous two years.",
      "Roy Keane also admitted he took at least one of his rants against Maguire too far. But Keane and MP Adongo were just jumping aboard the biggest bandwagon of the time.",
      "Maguire was panned by pundits and singled out as a figure of fun by a media playing to its public. We were probably guilty of that somewhere along the line. And United fans – players, even – cannot claim they were above the treatment meted out to their man under seige.",
      "He was booed across the world on pre-season tours, from Australia to America and back to Dublin. Stretford Enders will always differentiate themselves from the tourists and the online fanbase, but Maguire was also jeered at Old Trafford.",
      "His club hardly helped. Erik ten Hag stripped Maguire of the United captaincy in 2023, which may or may not have been the correct call, but it is a demotion from which many players’ egos would never recover.",
      "If that was too subtle on United’s part, that same summer, Maguire would have got the message that he wasn’t wanted anymore when the club publicly agreed to sell him to West Ham. At that point, it was almost a mercy mission on the Hammers’ part, and to anyone outside Maguire’s circle, a change of scene and a fresh start seemed the only sensible choice.",

      "But Maguire showed the kind of stubbornness and mental fortitude not often seen at Old Trafford in recent years. Unlike many ex-team-mates who couldn’t run away from the circus quick enough, Maguire has repeatedly proven his determination not only to achieve personal redemption, but collective too.",
      "Amorim cannot claim to have fixed Maguire. Within half a season of rejecting a move away from United, he won Premier League Player of the Month for December 2023 under Ten Hag. But Amorim and Maguire have certainly been good for one another.",
      "It helps Maguire that his manager prefers an abundance of centre-backs in a system we know he won’t change. Perhaps the defender is fortunate too that his particular skillset is back in demand while Premier League managers explore again the aerial route to goal.",
      "That includes Amorim. When he and United get really desperate – an all-too-often occurrence in the last 12 months – Maguire is dispatched from his own box to the opposition’s to serve as Amorim’s trusted cross magnet.",
      "Do not simply attribute Maguire’s aerial prowess to size or stature. The art of winning such duels is in timing and judgement. Crosses and set-pieces were seemingly viewed as boorish by many coaches desperate to prove their purity for a while then. Now, though, the bullet header is back. And few do it better than Maguire, evidenced by the moments that will define him as a cult hero when he leaves Old Trafford of his own accord, with his bulbous bonce held higher than even he could reasonably have dreamed two years ago.",
      "Mikel Arteta is guaranteed to face four of the remaining few managers and clubs he has yet to beat with Arsenal. Can Barca not just appoint Chris Coleman?",
      "Arsenal are just like Wimbledon in the 1980s, because nothing could be more Wimbledon in the 1980s than a 4-0 Champions League win over Atletico Madrid.",
      "It’s an overdue return for the Premier League manager rankings in what is already a really quite mental season.",
      "Arne Slot isn’t in danger really, is he? That’s presumably what these five elite managers thought when they won the title too…",
      "We know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Pep Guardiola. And it’s all absolutely on again.",
      "‘Arteta out’ is the cry from the sarcastic as a brilliant Gunners performance – especially from Martin Zubimendi – is hailed."

      "",
      "It was a huge win for Manchester United, but a bigger one for Ruben Amorim specifically. For the first time since the very earliest days of his United reign, back in the far-off dim and distant days of late 2024 where his biggest problem was Ed Sheeran gatecrashing post-match interviews for some reason, Amorim has one precious gift: time.",
      "For the first time all season he is not among the most conspicuously under-pressure managers, and not solely because all the other under-pressure managers have been sacked.",
      "Given the public backing he received during the darkest moments, this statement win is one that gives him plenty of cover.",
      "And even the league table now looks so much less appalling. It was easy, and fun, to joke about previous Man United corner-turning victories lifting them all the way to, say, 10th. But while they do remain in mid-table, that mid-table has become incredibly congested thanks to the weekend’s results at Anfield and elsewhere.",
      "Ninth place is still historically bad for Manchester United in the Premier League, but three points behind second place sounds a lot better.",
      "",
      "We are not about to go declaring a corner has been turned, because Manchester United have turned approximately 873 corners over the last 12 years under several different managers and always ended up back where they started. Or worse.",
      "But what a win. What a statement. What a header from Harry Maguire. And while finding themselves top of the table for results against top-half sides can be slightly misleading at this early stage of the season, it’s definitely a significant development for United.",
      "The wins against Chelsea and now Liverpool have shifted things significantly, because before that pair of wins there was a deeper misery to United’s miserable record under Amorim in that the few wins they were able to muster involved feeding on the Premier League’s very smallest beasts.",
      "Their miserable 24/25 return of 42 points actually masked just how bad they really were, with 16 of those points coming from six games against the three relegated teams who were, collectively, the worst group of relegated clubs in Premier League history.",
      "The fact United have won four games already this season is encouraging enough, given that low, low floor. But the fact two have come against Big Six opposition, along with a home win over Sunderland that seems far more compelling than those previous successes against promoted teams, and even the encouraging opening-day performance against Arsenal does hint that something might actually be changing for United.",
      "There are going to be more bumps in the road, they are far from perfect and, while they were impressive yesterday, it still felt very much like a game that owed more to Liverpool’s total and widespread headloss than particular excellence on United’s part, there are still suddenly so many more reasons to be cheerful. And for now, that will absolutely do.",
      "",
      "Brighton, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham. Game on.",

      "Arguably the biggest winners from the Anfield shenanigans, because the scale of the contrast between their controlled, repeatable, sustainable and, yes, wonderfully p*ss-boiling methods and Liverpool’s chaos means that this really does look like a stunning opportunity now for a team that has spent three years being very good indeed yet still ultimately the butt of all the jokes.",
      "This last laugh is going to be very loud indeed, and we will all just have to accept they and we deserve it.",
      "There is already a clear reduction in the kind of sloppiness that has held Arsenal back in the last couple of seasons, a greater resilience to getting themselves bogged down in nonsense. That feels like a particularly useful knack in a season where everyone else appears to be absolutely riddled with nonsense.",
      "For the clearest illustration of the difference between Arsenal this season and last, the results comparison is compelling. They have won their last three games – at Newcastle, at home to West Ham, and now at Fulham. They took one point from the same three fixtures last season.",

      "A bit like Manchester United in some ways, their win at Spurs felt like it owed at least as much to the weirdness of their opponents as their own endeavour, but it was still a hugely significant 2-1 away win that hints at brighter things to come.",
      "Spurs’ sh*tness was kind of the yin to Liverpool’s yang. Or the other way round, we don’t know. Essentially, Liverpool were guilty of being just far too wild and chaotic and Spurs were guilty of barely even engaging in the game at all after taking an early lead.",
      "Villa, like United, won’t give a shiny sh*te about how bad their opponents were and will instead delight in the upturn in their own fortunes.",
      "Their two goals at Spurs were both beautiful pieces of work and only a curmudgeon like, well, us would insist on pointing out they were enormously assisted by Spurs simply not really bothering to engage with any part of the process in either of those attacks by a Villa team that created little else but also didn’t need to.",
      "After failing to win any of their first six games in all competitions as the hangover from the disappointment at how last season ended lingered on, they have now won five in a row with an extremely presentable chance to make that six when they travel to Go Ahead Eagles in the Europa League on Thursday.",
      "It’s Manchester City and Liverpool after that, but for every reason those are now fixtures Villa can once again relish rather than dread.",
      "",
      "Clear second favourites for the Premier League wouldn’t have represented an improvement on recent norms at many moments during Pep Guardiola’s Etihad reign, but it clearly does at this one.",
      "After last year’s Liverpool interruption it does very much look like we’re going to get another Arsenal-City title battle, if indeed we’re going to get a title battle at all.",
      "",
      "There is now a clear three-strong group of the world’s current best goalscorers, with Erling Haaland joining Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane in an elite trio of players where right now it’s not just the boggling number of goals they’re scoring but just how far clear they all already are of any domestic challenger within their own domain that they have come to so dominate so quickly.",
      "Haaland’s two goals this weekend take him to 11 Premier League goals, while Kane has 12 in the Bundesliga and Mbappe 10 in La Liga.",
      "Those are all crazy numbers at this early stage of those seasons, but more striking still is the fact that no other player in any of those divisions has scored more than six.",
      "",
      "With Fulham struggling a bit, it has fallen on Brighton to once more lead the way in showing the world the correct way to go about your mid-tabling.",
      "They have now beaten three of last season’s top five in Man City, Chelsea and Newcastle while remaining stubbornly, stoically and heroically 10th in the table.",
      "",
      "A hugely important win over Leeds that means the final matchday eight table will contain none of the promoted teams in its bottom three in a huge and welcome shift from recent seasons. Even if West Ham beat Brentford on Monday Night Football, a victory of sufficient scale to lift them above the Clarets would in turn send Brentford below them.",
      "The next step for Burnley is proving they can also beat those teams that were already in the Premier League and not just those who arrived with them having added success against Leeds to an earlier win over Sunderland. But that’s a thought for another day right now. That day specifically being on Sunday, when they face Wolves in another massive early six-pointer.",
      "",
      "Giddy times indeed as a fourth win of the season takes them beyond the points total Southampton managed in the whole of last season and leaves them a point behind Liverpool, level with Chelsea and Spurs, one ahead of Man United and above all else five points clear of Newcastle.",

      "The Red Devils won at Anfield for the first time since 2016 with Amorim victorious in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking over last season.",
      "Amorim is still under pressure if he doesn’t keep up current form after picking up just 40 points from his first 35 Premier League matches in charge at Man Utd.",
      "And Yorke has now urged Man Utd and Amorim to build on their shock result on Merseyside and warned them not to now “fall back into the decline”.",
      "Reacting to the win over Man Utd, Yorke exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Escapist Magazine: “Massive win. I think a lot of people didn’t probably give United any chance of getting three points there, despite, you know, Liverpool not really being on song with the three defeats prior to that game. Man U getting the first win [at Anfield] for a while.",
      "“But it was never going to be an easy task with it at Anfield, we know that we haven’t won there in 10 years either, so the likelihood of getting the result, I think it was very slim. However, the boys have turned up and delivered another fantastic performance and a result that not too many people had given them a chance. And on top of that, winning two games back to back, which they haven’t been able to do. So it’s been a real uptick, and a lot of happy United fans including myself yesterday.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Slot, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal and so many more",
      "“Is this the kind of result that can change United’s season? You should hope so, beating one of your rivals. We know the City derby is huge, but nothing like Liverpool. The history between those two clubs, and so you would have thought that will.",
      "“If that doesn’t give you the incentive and the additional confidence to go forward, I’m not so sure what will. So I hope that with this result and the back-to-back wins will then inspire the players that it can be done, and that will inspire them and give them the extra confidence going into the rest of the campaign.",
      "“The one thing they’ve got to be safeguarding against is the fact that after they win against Liverpool, everyone is coming after them, and you have to have a reaction for that. So what you can’t afford to allow to happen is getting these two good results, which are huge results against Liverpool, and then falling back into the decline. So it’ll be interesting.",
      "“All eyes will be on them the next game that they play. And you don’t want to make one step forward and two steps backwards. I hope they don’t fall into that old cliché one and get carried away and think that’s it and they could live on the back of just the Liverpool results. They need to kick on.”",
      "When asked what the target is for the rest of the season, Yorke added: “I think top four, it’s usually the usual standard. They’ve got to get back to the top six. Top four will be a remarkable return.",
      "“No one envisaged that, even myself, who is obviously a United fan. I’ll be happy with top six considering where we finished last season, because that’s an uptick. It’d be an uphill task. But what we see is that everybody can beat each other at any given time and United certainly can do that. But they gotta get back on a much more consistent base.",
      "“I always revert back to just beat the teams around you. Beat the teams who you are supposed to beat on paper. It’s when you’re getting beaten against those teams that it’s a bit worrying. We know they can produce these kinds of performances against Liverpool and City in the past, and you’ve got to roll your sleeves up and get results against the lesser teams.”",
      "Liverpool are not dealing well with “becoming the hunted” after winning the Premier League title last season, according to Dwight Yorke."

      "As a United fan, that win at Anfield felt straight out of Blackadder. Amorim clearly pulled a Baldrick: score early, suffer bravely, then let Maguire deliver the punchline. Slot’s Liverpool had all the flair but none of the plot. If this is Amorim’s “cunning plan,” long may the chaos continue.",
      "Still, that opener came from a proper Van Dijk-led muddle — Mac Allister takes a heavy knock, play rolls on, and United pounce. Great for us, worrying for him. The kind of thing that should make the league review concussion protocols again. If that sort of head clash doesn’t stop play, then what’s the point of concussion protocols? Football can be gloriously daft, but not at the expense of someone’s memory.\nGaptoothfreak, Man. Utd., New York (Baldrick 1, Slot 0)",

      "Simply marvellous.\nGarey Vance, MUFC",

      "There will be a lot of very happy United fans, and many Amorim fans pointing vigorously at the result and shouting “see!”. Well, maybe. And while 3 points is great, especially at Anfield, a sensible head will note that we could easily have conceded 4 if Gakpo and Salah didn’t seem to have been paid off. Honestly, Gakpo’s missed header near the end, you have to wonder how. While also worth noting United could have scored a couple more too with Bruno missing quite badly.",

      "The last two games have really shown what a difference a reliable keeper makes. As keepers go he seems fine. Could be good, but most importantly he appears to be calm and unobtrusive. Does keeper stuff, gets the game going again, and the whole team seems more relaxed for it.",

Spent the entire international break crying about set pieces, is always moaning about opponents changing their line-ups (the audacity of opposition to adjust tactics against Liverpool!), loves going about how other teams play low block (it’s called defending, maybe Slot can learn what it is) and always has an excuse for why opposition goals / tactics are massively unfair for Liverpool.",
      "The cherry on top was him going about how Liverpool players couldn’t possibly fake head injuries and how the officials should have checked the badge on the shirt before making the decision, despite his own players taking each other out! Yes, because if it’s one thing Liverpool have lacked this season, it’s the officials not favoring them like letting Salah volley the ball into the net with his hands. Maybe if he actually had an ounce of integrity and believed in what he said, he should have made a concussion sub immediately instead of letting Alexis play on?",
      "What the 4 losses in a row has shown is how immensely soft Slot and this Liverpool squad is. The tiniest bit of pressure (most of that being self inflicted after spending HALF A BILLION of the king’s finest) has seen them panic. It shows what a massive fluke last season was where every team was decimated with injuries and Liverpool won by default by being able to field a mostly fit XI all year with Salah playing out of his mind on a contract year.",
      "This is a club that has been media darlings all year, avoiding all the noise that other clubs have to deal with and still spend most of their time and energy obsessed with other clubs instead of focusing on fixing their glaring weaknesses. Salah looks to be pulling a post contract Aubameyang, Isak looks like he’s never played in the league before, Kerkez can’t defend, Frimpong can’t start and Wirtz has been so poor its expected for him not to start Liverpool’s biggest game of the season despite being a British record breaking transfer! I guess that’s what ZERO G/A in ELEVEN games does.",
      "Liverpool losing on a set piece after denigrating them for weeks (despite having set pieces to thank for beating the league leaders and multiple other games) was justice done.

Which has an effect on Ibou’s positioning.\nRobbo – get him back in, what harm can it do.\nMacca – slowly getting back up to speed but very far off it at the moment.\nGravenberch – one of the few that has been excellent.\nSzoboszlai – wants to be captain. Let him play in the centre of the field.\nWirtz – has an excellent understanding with Frimpong, so put them both on the right.\nGakpo – between him and the Grav as our player of the season thus far.\nEkitike – should be starting while his form and fitness is clearly better than Isak’s.\nKerkez – looking lost at the moment. He’s still young, some time studying Robbo would do him well.\nSalah – should swallow his pride, work on his game, come back stronger. I love Mo but he needs to be benched.\nIsak – just looks angry at the moment. Shouting at Newcastle, shouting at Sweden. He’s earned his big move and now needs to start enjoying it.",

      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot proved that he’s a salty Jurgen Klopp regen with two stupid comments about Manchester United on Sunday…",
      "Slot has been a media darling for most of his tenure at Liverpool and has been widely praised for his forthright assessments of games in front of cameras immediately after the final whistle.",
      "However, cracks in his image are starting to appear as pressure mounts on the Liverpool boss amid a dire run of four straight losses in all competitions.",
      "Liverpool’s mini-crisis before the international break turned into a full-blown crisis on Sunday afternoon as they were deservedly beaten 2-1 by arch-rivals Manchester United at Anfield.",
      "Subsequently, Wayne Rooney has raised a worrying change he’s seen in Slot, who has been showing similar character traits to his predecessor, Klopp, when on the end of a disappointing result.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "Klopp was the sorest of losers when things didn’t go his way and Slot stopped short of praising Man Utd by making daft comments about their playing style and Ruben Amorim’s decision regarding Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“If you play United – who come here with a low block and playing a lot of long balls and you know that is going to be difficult as it’s not easy to play through them and you don’t get the chance to win the ball high up – and you concede after one or two minutes, it makes it harder,” Slot said.",
      "“It’s always difficult to defend against a team that defends in a low block, that mainly plays long balls.",
      "“But it makes it even more difficult when you go 1-0 down after one minute when a player of ours is on the floor.",
      "“If you would have told me before the game that against the low block, against the team that plays so many long balls, we would have created as many chances as we did, I would not have expected us to lose this game of football.”",
      "READ: Slot ‘ain’t the guy’ – he’s a ‘d***head’ who can’t ‘manage his way out of this hole’ at Liverpool",
      "Before the game, Slot commented on Amorim’s decision not to start Sesko. He said: “We’ve seen Sesko play the last three, four, five or six times, but they go to Liverpool they change the line-up.",
      "“That’s not the first where we’ve faced a team and they’ve done that.”",
      "Starting with the long balls, Man Utd did play more than Liverpool (75-47) and their long pass proportion was 25.5% compared to 9.8% for their opponents.",
      "But this is only an issue in Slot’s mind because his team came up short, having been outsmarted by Amorim and his team.",
      "Put simply, Slot needs to focus on being better to quell the threat of Man Utd and other teams that have had success against Liverpool, with the Reds and their head coach made to look pretty inept by Amorim.",
      "According to Opta, Man Utd’s ratio of long passes against Liverpool was their highest since the 3-1 win over Arsenal in December 2017, so this was a tactic deployed to increase their chances of success at Anfield, which is also the case with the rotation of Sesko.",
      "Sesko being on the bench amid his strong form before the international break raised eyebrows, but this, like the focus on long passes, was an inspired decision from Amorim as Man Utd’s fluid and mobile front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount caused Liverpool’s fragile defence no end of problems.",
      "And Amorim is obviously within his rights to tinker with his XI from game-to-game to get the better of an opponent, which is exactly what happened against Liverpool and Slot.",
      "Amorim got all of his major decisions spot on as he schooled Slot, while blind panic got the better of the Liverpool boss as he and his team were deservedly punished.",
      "READ NEXT: De Ligt reveals Man Utd targeted two Liverpool stars as Red Devils ‘knew’ their ‘weaknesses’",
      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has cleared up that he didn’t mean to be negative about Manchester United after the Reds’ defeat to them, telling Ruben Amorim he had a “very ...",
      "Arne Slot isn’t in danger really, is he? That’s presumably what these five elite managers thought when they won the title too…",
      "There are pleas for Arne Slot to be sacked and pleas for patience for Arne Slot. But some things do need to change.",
      "You thought you knew Arne Slot? Just wait until you hear what he did on holiday in Dubai.",
      "Former Premier League manager Martin O’Neill has told Arne Slot his job is “simple” and suggested he should stop whining about other team’s tactics, suggesting his approach is similar to ...",
      "A new report has revealed the internal reaction at Liverpool following Sunday afternoon’s disappointing 2-1 loss against Manchester United."

      "Man Utd are looking at the possibility of bringing Mason Greenwood back to Old Trafford as they ‘prepare’ an offer to Marseille, according to reports.",
      "While at Man Utd, the 23-year-old was suspended by the Red Devils on January 30, 2022 over allegations relating to a young woman after images and videos were posted online.",
      "He faced charges including attempted rape and assault, but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in February 2023 that the case had been discontinued.",
      "Greenwood eventually left Old Trafford in July 2024 when he joined Marseille in a deal worth €31.6m with Man Utd retaining a 50 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "The 24-year-old has largely performed well for the French side since moving with 21 goals and five assists in 34 Ligue Un appearances last term.",
      "After scoring four goals as Marseille beat Le Havre 6-2 on Saturday, Greenwood took has tally to the season to seven goals and four assists in ten matches in all competitions.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘decided to take an ambitious step in the market and is preparing an outlay of close to €100m to repatriate’ Greenwood in the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United let Mason Greenwood leave for Olympique Marseille in 2024 for around €26 million and retains a 50% release clause on his future sale. Sources close to the English club indicate they are not satisfied with receiving that portion and want to rectify the situation with an outright purchase.",
      "‘In Manchester, they suggest that the €100 million fee would allow Mason Greenwood to be brought back without sharing profits or depending on subsequent release clauses. The club values ​​both his performance in France and his commercial potential following his improved image.’",
      "Despite a sale elsewhere meaning Man Utd ‘would still receive a significant percentage thanks to his resale clause, they prefer to assume the cost now and gain full control of the player’.",
      "When asked whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better. He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "“He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it’s necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "Previously speaking of Greenwood’s potential, De Zerbi said: “All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I’m here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that’s my job.",
      "“I would especially like to help him be remembered, in this stadium and by these supporters, as one of the greatest players to have played here at the Velodrome. There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I’m trying to help him progress.”",
      "De Zerbi continued: “If he wants to become a great player, he must run off the ball. I saw Mbappe, I saw Dembele pressing without the ball, and Greenwood has to do it too. He has worked on pressing, but not always. When he wants to, he does it, and he must understand that this effort is what separates the greats.”",
      "READ NEXT: Rooney claims it’s ‘so important’ Man Utd star is in the England squad for the World Cup",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could receive a sizable windfall as Mason Greenwood is attracting interest from Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",

      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:17, UK",
      "Harry Maguire stunned Liverpool as his 84th-minute header clinched Manchester United's first win at Anfield since 2016 and condemned the hosts to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "Maguire guided in Bruno Fernandes's cross just six minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out a controversial opening goal from Bryan Mbeumo only 62 seconds into a thrilling contest.",
      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Liverpool: Mamardashvili (5), Bradley (6), Van Dijk (5), Konate (6), Kerkez (5), Gravenberch (6), Szoboszlai (7), Mac Allister (6), Salah (5), Gakpo (7), Isak (5).\n\n\nSubs: Jones (6), Wirtz (6), Ekitike (6), Chiesa (7), Frimpong (6).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), De Ligt (7), Maguire (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (5), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (8), Amad (8), Mount (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Sesko (6), Yoro (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Harry Maguire",
      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything. Sometimes you play more with the ball, other days you play without the ball.",
      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",
      "\"We have not given our fans enough days like today, so it has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points.",
      "\"It is not just three points to the club and to the boys. I have been coming to this ground for seven years now and to not get three points has been tough. It's for the fans and I hope they had a great night tonight.",
      "\"We won't get carried away because we can't afford that as a club, we will use it as motivation.\"",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Ruben Amorim had cited his set-piece threat and he delivered.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",
      "\"He needed something, the pressure was building but a win at Anfield is huge.",
      "\"It's a great place for Manchester United to win a game of football.",
      "\"It's a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag.",
      "\"They have to make sure this is the start of something.",
      "\"Harry Maguire and his team-mates will be proud tonight.\"",
      "\"We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost.\"",
      "\"It is an interesting time because we have to stick together, not just us as players but as a club and the fans who want us to win.\"",

      "Plus: Morgan Rogers repays Unai Emery's faith as resurgent Aston Villa inflict more woe on Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium",
      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.Nick Wright",
      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
      "Frank, then, will be relieved their next three games are all away."

      "Gary Neville says the next few weeks are \"crucial\" for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era - and believes they should be able to get into the top six after a dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",
      "\"Amorim has got to start trusting those players. I know we talk about trusting Ruben Amorim and him being under pressure, and that's always going to be the case with the manager, but Ruben Amorim wants to be able to trust his players.",
      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",
      "\"There's no doubt those players admire their coach, they like him as a person, but they've got to start trusting each other, trust the system if you're the players, but also Ruben Amorim, trust his players that they can deliver consistently.",
      "\"I'm just looking towards next week now. Enjoy tonight because it's one of the greatest moments you can have as a United player, winning at Anfield, and it happens rarely, so enjoy tonight.",
      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "Player ratings as Man Utd beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield to claim first back-to-back league wins under Ruben Amorim; Harry Maguire headed winning goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's acrimonious opener; Liverpool have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2014",
      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
