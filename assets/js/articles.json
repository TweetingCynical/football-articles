      "Former Newcastle United star Elliot Anderson is said to be on Manchester United's trasfer radar, as per ex-Old Trafford scout Mick Brown.",
      "Anderson, who made 55 appearances for the Magpies after rising through their youth system, moved to Nottingham Forest in a £35 million deal back in July 2024.",
      "The decision to let the talented 22-year-old go was met with criticism at the time, but Eddie Howe's side were forced to sell to meet Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules. In a simultaneous move, reserve goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos was transferred to Newcastle for £20m.",

      "Read more: Why time is running out for Ruben Amorim to show he is the man to turn Man Utd around",
      "There were concerns that Newcastle might rue letting Anderson go, given his potential to become a top-tier Premier League player, and it seems he's now living up to those expectations.",
      "Indeed, Anderson was instrumental in Forest's impressive seventh-place finish last season, earning them a spot in this season's Europa League. His stellar performances have continued this season, culminating in an England senior debut against Andorra earlier this month under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "After a standout performance that earned him the Player of the Match award, Anderson was rewarded with a second cap for England's match against Serbia, where he once again shone.",
      "With Anderson turning heads both at Forest and on international duty, rumours about his future are heating up. According to ex-United boss Brown, the Reds are mulling over a potential move.",
      "\"Man United have been looking at Anderson,\" Brown told Football Insider. \"He's done a tremendous job at Nottingham Forest and then he's come into the England side and turned in a man-of-the-match performance. United see him as exactly the type of midfielder they would like to bring in.",
      "\"He gets up and down the park, he's confident and secure in possession of the ball, and he's not afraid to put in a tackle which is something they need.",
      "\"Anderson would solve, or certainly help with, a lot of the issues they've had under Amorim. Everybody knows they wanted a midfielder in the summer but they couldn't find the right one who was available at the price they wanted.",
      "\"I don't know what Anderson would cost, but he is somebody who's been on their radar. He would be the ideal player to fill the gaps they've had in the squad.\"",
      "Reports suggest Forest rate Anderson at a minimum of £70m - twice what the Reds paid for him just over 12 months ago. At present, it's believed the midfielder has no intention of departing The City Ground.",
      "However, should he make the switch to Manchester, would Newcastle be entitled to compensation through a potential sell-on agreement?",
      "Chronicle Live believes the Magpies don't possess a buy-back option despite suggestions the club can trigger specific clauses in his deal with Forest.",
      "Should Newcastle want Anderson back, they'd need to pay the full market rate for the midfielder, with his worth rising after every display at present. It's been hinted that Newcastle may not have a sell-on clause in Anderson's contract, which could be a significant setback if he is sold for a hefty sum.",
      "Anderson wasn't the only player Newcastle had to let go last season to comply with PSR rules. The Magpies also offloaded Yankuba Minteh to Brighton and Hove Albion in a deal worth roughly £30m.",
      "However, the decision to let Anderson go was always one that could come back to bite them - and it has.",

The only goal of the game came courtesy of an own goal by Luiz Junior in the fourth minute, securing a fourth victory in five games for Frank since he took over from Ange Postecoglou at Spurs.",
      "This promising start to the season has been achieved despite several key players being sidelined due to injuries. James Maddison is anticipated to be out of action until 2026 following an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained during pre-season.",
      "Despite their injuries, Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Radu Dragusin often show up at Spurs' home games to cheer on their teammates, and Tuesday night was no exception. However, before the match against Villarreal, Maddison took part in EA Sports' First Gameplay Livestream event in London.",
      "Joining gaming community figures such as Angry Ginge, Behzinga and Niko Omilana, Maddison helped hype up the forthcoming version of the game and teamed up with Adebayo Akinfenwa during the stream, reports football.london.",

The initiative, which is tied to the 2026 World Cup, will also pay the clubs of players released for the World Cup Qualifiers for the first time.",
      "The combined figure is also close to a 70 per cent rise on the £153m kitty which was distributed following the 2022 World Cup in Qatar although, during that tournament, only nations who made it to the finals were compensated.",
      "Part of a renewed memorandum of understanding between FIFA and the European Club Association, the CBP looks to create a more diverse system for the beautiful game worldwide.",
      "Speaking about the programme on Tuesday, FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, said: \"The enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament.",
      "\"A record USD 355 million will be distributed to clubs for the release of their players, and this reinforces our solid collaboration with the European Club Association and clubs worldwide as we all look forward to a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition of the FIFA World Cup next year.\"",
      "Running since the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, 440 clubs from 51 FIFA member associations were paid by the initiative at the last World Cup. In that instalment of the prestigious tournament, 837 players were involved in the scheme, leading to an estimated release of £8,012 per player, per day.",
      "As per FIFA's website, England were the highest-awarded nation through the CBP in 2022, with an estimated £32.6m going to clubs. Elsewhere, Spain, Germany, Italy and France made up the rest of the top-five nations which benefited most.",
      "With the 2026 instalment of the programme set to include compensation for the players of nations who compete in the qualifying rounds, the number of clubs benefiting from the CBP is also expected to rise substantially.",
      "European Club Association Chairman, Nasser Al-Khelaifi said of the development: \"At ECA we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme. It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA’s Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game. .",

      "Meanwhile, further international breaks will take place between October 6 and October 14, November 10 and November 18, and March 23 to March 31, as players and squads vie for their place in the World Cup.

      "Even though the current season is still in its infancy and the transfer window has long since closed, Liverpool might already be planning for January. It seems that the Reds already have a number of targets lined up for the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise have both been linked with potential moves to Anfield in recent days. With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the standout rumours around Anfield.",
      "Liverpool are preparing to make a bid for Brighton star and Manchester United target Carlos Baleba. The midfielder was a major interest for the Red Devils during the summer window.",

      "According to IndyKaila, Liverpool are making 'serious moves' for Baleba in the January window, making it a potential deal to watch out for.",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler recently opened up about the future of young talent Baleba, acknowledging the challenges he faces. He said \"I think it's normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him. It's not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore, we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund showed his delight at reuniting with Scott McTominay as the pair linked up on the pitch at Napoli for the first time. The 22-year-old striker sealed a loan switch to the Serie A giants this summer after slipping down the pecking order at Old Trafford following the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Although Hojlund initially maintained he wanted to battle for his spot in Ruben Amorim's starting line-up, it quickly became apparent that the fprward would be afforded more opportunities elsewhere. The Denmark international moved to the Italian outfit for the campaign with a commitment for the club to purchase him for £38million next summer should specific conditions be fulfilled.",
      "There, he has reunited with ex-United colleague McTominay, who has been outstanding in Naples since his £26m transfer last summer. It seems McTominay has quickly re-established his rapport with Hojlund, as shown by an image Napoli posted this week from their encounter with Fiorentina on Saturday.",
      "The club's official Instagram page uploaded a picture of the duo embracing, with the caption: \"From Manchester with love.\" Hojlund was swift to express his approval of the post, not only giving liking it but also sharing it to his Instagram stories, demonstrating his joy at being reunited with McTominay on the pitch.",
      "Hojlund appears to be adapting brilliantly in Naples, having got on the scoresheet alongside Kevin De Bruyne and Sam Beukema in the club's 3-1 triumph against Fiorentina. A fresh start could prove to be precisely what he needs, having previously impressed in Serie A with Atalanta before his switch to United two seasons ago.",
      "The striker notched 10 goals and four assists across 34 matches at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia before United swooped for him in a £72m transfer, though he struggled to make an immediate impact in the Premier League. Hojlund managed just four goals from 32 top-flight appearances last season, as United stumbled to a woeful 15th-placed finish.",
      "He'll now aim to recapture his goalscoring touch in Italy, with United pressing ahead without him for the 2025/26 campaign. Discussing the challenge that lies ahead following his loan switch, Hojlund revealed: \"I was very excited, because it's a team that just won the league.",
      "\"I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I'm very happy for this opportunity. It's different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I'm a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "\"I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.\"",
      "The Red Devils suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their first match of the season, before securing a 1-1 draw against Fulham away from home. A 3-2 triumph over newly-promoted Burnley followed at Old Trafford, but United were then given a harsh reality check with a 3-0 thrashing at the Etihad Stadium in Sunday's Manchester derby.",

      "Jose Mourinho could find a quick return to management, with Benfica looking to appoint him by the weekend after sacking Bruno Lage. The Portuguese giants had been linked with Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim, but have reached an agreement with Mourinho.",
      "The 62-year-old, who was sacked by Fenerbahce last month, led the Lisbon outfit for 11 games in his first managerial role back in 2000. Reports in Portugal now say he is set to return to Estadio da Luz as Benfica react to their embarrassing Champions League loss to Qarabag.",
      "Lage paid the price for squandering a 2-0 lead at home and was axed in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Benfica’s president, Rui Costa, insisted a change of head coach was needed after the shocking result as they seek to become the premier club in Portugal again.",
      "He made his intentions to act quickly very clear, with CNN Portugal reporting that an agreement in principle has been reached, with the two parties now finalising a contract. Costa said: \"Regarding the next coach, we expect to have the new one on the bench at Vila das Aves next Saturday.\"",
      "That is set to be Mourinho, who has a huge reputation in his homeland. It was with Porto that the iconic coach first made his name, dominating domestically and claiming the UEFA Cup and the Champions League in successive seasons before his move to Chelsea.",
      "Should Benfica land Mourinho then it may well close off an escape route for Amorim, whose job at United continues to look precarious. That is despite the Old Trafford hierarchy maintained they are behind their man, regardless of his horrendous record.",
      "The leading candidate to become Benfica's next president, Joao Noronha Lopes, travelled to Manchester last weekend to watch Amorim's side lose 3-0 to Manchester City at the Etihad. Lopes has made no secret of his plans to bring Amorim back to Benfica if he does down Costa in next month’s elections.",
      "Speaking in an interview with Record earlier this week, he made no hiding of his admiration for Amorim - although did distance himself from actually appointing him.",

      "From January 2011 to the summer of 2014, the controversial forward managed 82 goals in 133 appearances, including a phenomenal final season where he scored 31 in 33 league matches.",
      "As such, he is one of the few players, along with Fernando Torres, to hold legend status at both Liverpool and Atletico, despite being booed by the Anfield faithful upon his return to face them in the Champions League in November 2021.",
      "The Reds won that group stage clash 2-0 courtesy of goals from the late Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane. And it is unclear which of his former sides Suarez will support on Wednesday evening as they face off at Anfield, four years on from their last encounter.",

      "The crisis that looks to be unfolding at Manchester United seems to be worsening by the day. After their stunning second-round Carabao Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town, United were comfortably beaten 3-0 in the Manchester Derby at the weekend.",
      "This season was supposed to herald a new dawn for United's under-fire manager Ruben Amorim after their 15th-placed finish last season, coupled with their crushing Europa League final defeat by Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Yet despite a host of new signings, Amorim is again under increasing scrutiny. United are currently 14th in the league with just one win in four, which came via a late penalty against newly-promoted Burnley before the international break.",
      "Former United goalkeeper Ben Foster has made a major claim about Amorim's position in the Red Devils' hot seat. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Foster believes Amorim is already in the owner's sights for the sack, and actions are in motion, but nobody at Old Trafford wants to pull the trigger on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Foster said: \"It’s already rumbling. It’s already there. It’s been rumbling for a long time. Nobody just wants to really commit to it. But I guarantee you, if, after eight games, they’ve got eight points and they’re still in 14th or 15th position, somebody’s gonna have to pull the trigger because it can’t carry on like that because it’s been proven now. It’s nearly a year since he’s been the manager. It won’t work.\"",
      "United started the Manchester derby with Altay Bayındir between the sticks, despite signing goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day for £18.2million. Previous No. 1 Andre Onana also left the club on loan for Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "However, ex-United midfielder Scholes maintains that it is a \"criminal offence\" if United were not interested in Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer. City eventually completed the signing of PSG's Champions League-winning keeper for just £27m, with the Italian impressing against United on Sunday.",
      "\"I don't think the quality is there [in the side],\" Scholes told the BBC. \"Goalkeeper was a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise [Andre] Onana is not good enough?",
      "\"If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that is [a] criminal offence. The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"",
      "Speaking of Amorim's now-infamous commitment to his 3-4-3 system, a formation many believe will cost the 40-year-old his job, Scholes insisted United's manager must change his tactics.",
      "\"He cannot carry on playing this way, he just can't,\" Scholes said. \"At some point there has to be a moment where he thinks, 'I have to change something because what I am doing now is not working and I am not getting results.",
      "\"The proof is there. I like Amorim, with everything he says, he seems to be a likeable man. But unfortunately results paint a picture.\" Up next for Amorim and United is a home clash with Chelsea on Saturday, September 20.",

      "Ruben Amorim is said to be \"losing the dressing room\" at Manchester United, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's on his way out of Old Trafford. This comes after Erik ten Hag demonstrated how to extend his tenure with the club despite similar rumours long before he was eventually given the boot.",
      "Following a dismal Premier League finish in 15th place last season, United are currently 14th in the table after Sunday's crushing 3-0 defeat at Manchester City. The Red Devils won't be participating in European competition this season and have already been knocked out of the EFL Cup following an embarrassing loss to League Two side Grimsby.",
      "This has led to rumours Amorim is finding it difficult to maintain the support of his players less than a year into his tenure. However, nearly 11 months passed between Ten Hag being subject to the same rumours and his eventual dismissal in October 2024.",
      "Ten Hag's disagreement with Sancho was well-documented, with the Dutch manager expressing concerns about the winger's training displays early in the 2023/24 season. The former City youth player returned to Borussia Dortmund on loan in January 2024 as United showed signs of improvement.",
      "If it hadn't been for United's FA Cup final victory over City in May 2024, Ten Hag would likely have been given the boot sooner. However, that win bought him some time beyond the 2024 summer transfer window, during which he received further support from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team.",
      "Fast forward to the present day, and there are some uncanny parallels between those days of uncertainty and the current state of affairs at United. Amorim was given the resources to overhaul his squad in his first summer transfer window at the club, while offloading a lot of players considered surplus to requirements.",
      "The notorious 'bomb squad', including the likes of Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony, have all been shipped out, either on loan or permanently. Yet it appears there are still some at Amorim's disposal who are finding it hard to get on board.",
      "United have only managed one win from their last five matches in all competitions this season. Even then, a controversial injury-time penalty was needed to edge past newly-promoted Burnley at Old Trafford last month.",
      "It was always predicted the team would need time to adjust to Amorim's favoured three-at-the-back system. But with around £250million splashed out on new signings since his arrival, patience is wearing thin as to how much longer it will take before the system starts delivering results.",
      "There's a growing sense of unease within the squad, with some senior players reportedly baffled by Amorim's rigid tactics. These players feel the manager is sticking to a game plan that doesn't suit the team, despite Amorim insisting he'll stick to the methods that brought him success at Sporting CP.",
      "Many are questioning how long the Portuguese will last in Manchester, with the consensus being his days are numbered unless there's a drastic improvement in results soon. However, if United's handling of Ten Hag's situation, despite rumours of him \"losing the dressing room,\" is anything to go by, Amorim might still have plenty of time to turn things around.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "While the club's hierarchy are currently sticking with Amorim, a list of potential replacements is circulating. Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Fulham boss Marco Silva are among the favourites to take over with bookmakers, with former United midfielder (and interim head coach) Michael Carrick also leading the way.",
      "Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and ex-England boss Gareth Southgate are also in the running.",
      "With United's dismal start to the campaign, it's inevitable that Amorim would face questions about his future. He has indicated that the ultimate decision rests elsewhere.",

      "\"He is a Benfica fan. Of course I like him. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign. Bruno Lage will be Benfica's coach, naturally. I will work with him, as he is Benfica's coach. I will not be a factor in Benfica's instability.\"",

      "Bayindir kept his place in the starting XI for the Manchester Derby on Sunday, but the 3-0 defeat did little to convince Amorim to stick with the Turkey international. Lammens is 23 and has only ever played club football in Belgium, but he has caught the eye of United’s veteran third-choice keeper Tom Heaton.",
      "“It’s only been a few days training but he seems like a really good lad,” Heaton said on the Training Ground Guru podcast. “He’s calm but [has] a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive and I think I said that to him after a couple of days training.",
      "“Twenty-three years old coming into Manchester United, first few days training and he’s been very impressive so far. I really like his goalkeeping fundamentals.”",
      "Amorim stuck with Bayindir for the derby because he was reluctant to throw Lammens into such a big occasion on debut. \"I believe in Altay he is ready to play. It's a different league, a different country, a different ball,” he said. “So they will fight for the position. We are really pleased [with Lammens]. He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "\"We are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience, but we also have to look at the present, with a focus on the future, so it's a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "Despite missing out, Lammens is delighted to have touched down in Manchester. “This is my dream move,” he told MUTV after signing. ”When I was five, United was at the height of football and you keep in your memory how big Manchester United is, so, when I heard they were interested, it was like a childhood dream.",

      "United's late 3-2 victory at home to Burnley before the international break remains their only high point in the 2025-26 campaign, which for Amorim has gotten off to a nightmare start. After being backed with £216m worth of new signings during the summer transfer window, the Portuguese is still struggling for positive results.",
      "Sunday's 3-0 drubbing in the Manchester derby only weakened his case to stay on as manager, and he could join the long line of bosses who've failed to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford. That's because sacking Amorim would cost United a staggering £12m in compensation, according to the Mail.",
      "That's more than the £10.6m which the Red Devils paid Sporting Lisbon to bring the 40-year-old in a mere 10 months ago. Amorim would become the seventh manager to be sacked by United - and receive a healthy compensation package - since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "The first casualty of the post-Ferguson era was David Moyes. The current Everton boss was axed in April 2014, just nine months into his six-year contract at Old Trafford, costing the club £5.2m.",
      "Louis van Gaal was his replacement, managing two seasons at the helm. Despite winning the FA Cup in May 2016, Ed Woodward and Co. made the ruthless decision to sack the Dutch boss, paying him £8.4m.",
      "Jose Mourinho was next in the hot seat, and his sacking remains the most costly. In December 2018, following a below-par start to his third season, the Special One was given his marching orders and paid a cool £19.6m after lifting three trophies during his tumultuous tenure.",
      "After a remarkable period as interim manager, United hoped that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would finally be the solution. Although the Red Devils legend lasted nearly four years in charge, the longest of anyone since Ferguson's departure, he was reluctantly axed for £10m in November 2021.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs changed tack with their next appointment, bringing Ralf Rangnick in as an interim manager. The plan was for the acclaimed German coach to become a consultant from May 2022, but he and the hierarchy didn't see eye-to-eye regarding his successor, and Rangnick was dismissed for a cool £15m.",
      "Finally - at least for now - Erik ten Hag's exit cost United £14.5m. Despite having his contract extended last summer, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's new-look hierarchy decided enough was enough in November 2024 and turned to Amorim.",

Rooney has been heavily critical of the United boss following their 3-0 defeat by Manchester City and may come face to face with Amorim in the coming weeks.",
      "United legend Rooney is one of many pundits and former players to slam Amorim for failing to make any improvements since arriving last November. The Portuguese boss has won just eight of his 31 league games in charge and Rooney feels he has no choice but to say what he’s seeing.",
      "That is despite his 15-year-old son Kai playing for the club and Klay, 12, also being involved in the United academy. Rooney regularly visits Carrington to drop off and collect his eldest sons and knows that his opinions could land him in hot water at the club.",
      "“Me more than anyone, I want to see the club doing well. We have to be honest and that’s the difficulty we have. I was speaking with Rio [Ferdinand] yesterday on this,” he explained on The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "“We want to support the team, we want to support the manager as best we can, but we also have to be honest as well because the fans are not fools and we have to give our honest opinion on what we're seeing.",

It does put us in an uncomfortable position but we have to be honest with what we're seeing. And frankly it’s just not good enough.”",

There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving.",

      "Ruben Amorim effectively has three games to save his job as Manchester United boss. United have taken just four points from their opening four Premier League games this season to stand 14th in the table.",
      "Amorim has won just eight of his 31 league games since taking over at United 10 months ago and is said to be losing the confidence of some of his senior players.",
      "Although the United hierarchy insist Amorim retains their full backing and they have no plans to replace him, it is understood they will assess the situation and the trajectory of the team after their next three games.",
      "United, who lost Sunday's Manchester derby 3-0 at local rivals City, host Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday, followed by a trip to Brentford and a home encounter with newly-promoted Sunderland, before the two-week international break.",
      "Amorim knows he is under huge pressure after such a poor start to the new season, on the back of last term, when United limped to 15th place under him, their worst league position for 51 years.",
      "United travel to arch rivals and champions Liverpool in their first game following the international break, and club chiefs will be under pressure to replace Amorim before then if there is no upturn in form and results before that daunting trip to Anfield.",
      "Despite privately insisting they still have faith in Amorim, United's football leadership team gave the same assurances to Erik ten Hag, before pulling the plug on him nine league games into last season.",
      "United's league fixture with Sunderland will be their eighth of the season and Amorim is acutely aware he will continue to come under fire and test the faith of those who hired him if he cannot take the team on a winning run.",
      "“It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United,\" he said after the defeat at The Etihad. \"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that.",
      "\"But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "According to the bookmakers, the candidates to replace Amorim are Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, former England head coach Gareth Southgate, Fulham's Marco Silva and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola.",
      "Ex-Tottenham boss and current USA head coach, Mauricio Pochettino, linked with the United job when Ten Hag was appointed, is also backed to be in the frame to take over at Old Trafford, should Amorim be sacked.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A former Manchester United star has voiced fears that Benjamin Sesko is encountering the identical struggles that plagued Rasmus Hojlund during his time at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old was snapped up by United from RB Leipzig at the beginning of August in a transfer valued at just under £74million.",
      "The forward was recruited to spearhead United's revamped attack, but has thus far been deployed sparingly by head coach Ruben Amorim. Sesko has yet to open his account after featuring in five matches across all competitions for United this campaign.",
      "The Slovenia international was given his maiden Premier League start against Manchester City on Sunday, but was largely left to survive on scraps as United suffered a 3-0 defeat to their fierce rivals. Former United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has voiced concern for Sesko regarding the shortage of opportunities created by his teammates during the encounter at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "He fears that United's attackers will face identical problems to the last campaign, when players like Hojlund struggled to find the back of the net, which suggests that Amorim still has plenty to figure out.",
      "\"I felt sorry for Sesko,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast. \"I thought he didn't get any service whatsoever and it's very similar to Hojlund last season. It looks like it's going to be hard work being a striker for Man United.",
      "\"If you're a striker, you need to score straight away, because it gets everybody off your back and it's something to build on.",
      "\"When you go four games, and you've gone to Grimsby away and you haven't scored and you go on an international break with Slovenia and haven't scored, it's hard work.\"",
      "Hojlund only managed to net ten times in 52 appearances for United last season before being shipped off to Napoli on a season-long loan at the start of September. The Danish striker made an immediate impact for the Serie A side, scoring just 14 minutes into his debut after getting the better of ex-United keeper David de Gea.",
      "Despite splashing out around £200million in the summer to bolster their attacking options, United's lack of goals is still a concern for many, including former defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "On his podcast, Rio Ferdinand Presents, he expressed his worries: \"The one I'm worried about is Sesko. He ain't getting no chances man, he ain't getting no opportunities, there's nothing created for him.",
      "\"That's the concern. A new striker comes in the football club, gets in the team, you've got to think about creating chances for him. Getting him on the end of things. He's got to think about getting on the end of things.",
      "\"That's something I think has got to be looked at, and fixed quick. I don't want to think about what it could turn out to be.\"",
      "He added: \"It's depressing watching United like that. The way we allowed them to get in and get goals and get opportunities - it was weak, it was powderpuff, it just lacked anything.",
      "\"I thought in the first-half, we pressed them quite well, and we had possession at times. [But then we] got in the final third, and there was zero creativity. Without Bruno [Fernandes], you're looking at it going, 'who else is going to create something - [Bryan] Mbeumo?' But there' s no real guile.\"",

      "Manchester United have had a rocky start to the Premier League season, with just one win, one draw and two losses in their first four matches. The results leave them languishing in 14th place in the table, having secured only four points out of a possible twelve so far.",
      "The 3-0 defeat at the hands of rivals Manchester City was a bitter pill for United fans to swallow. The shaky start has once again cast doubt over the future of manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite splashing out around £200 million on new talent during the summer transfer window, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, the team's early performances have highlighted ongoing issues within the squad. With the summer transfer window now firmly shut, it seems that any more changes to the squad will need to wait until January.",
      "Amid mounting pressure, Amorim may already be considering his options for the winter window, should he still be at the helm. A successful January could alleviate some of the strain on the Portuguese boss.",
      "So, what might an ideal January window look like for Amorim and United?",
      "In terms of incoming players, there's no question that bolstering the midfield should be top of United's agenda. The club did attempt to secure new players over the summer.",
      "However, Brighton's firm refusal to sell Carlos Baleba led to United abandoning any potential deal. Yet, they may decide to try their luck again in January, hoping that the Seagulls might be more amenable to a sale.",
      "If that's the case, then talks could start, with a deal hopefully being struck between all parties. The addition of Baleba could potentially offer Bruno Fernandes more leeway, even if he is operating in a deeper midfield position.",
      "Another name linked with United recently is Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson. The midfielder turned heads with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia during the international break.",
      "The ex-Newcastle player has demonstrated his ability to command games and set the pace, something that United have been lacking this season. However, as with Baleba, striking a deal with Forest may not be straightforward, as they'll be eager to retain a key player, particularly during Ange Postecoglou's first transfer window with the club.",
      "Moving away from the midfield, another area where United are likely to need additional cover is at right-back. At present, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the squad's two recognised players in that position",
      "An injury or suspension to just one would leave United short on options. United have been linked with an interest in Inter's Denzel Dumfries for some time.",
      "The full-back has recently confessed that he'd be open to a move to the Premier League, and would bring experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United manage to secure the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two other defensive midfielders in the January window, it could pave the way for Kobbie Mainoo to depart on loan for the remainder of the season. The midfielder expressed his wish for a temporary move during the summer, but United declined.",
      "The addition of new midfield options would enable the academy graduate to seek regular playing time elsewhere.",
      "Defender Tyler Fredricson could also possibly be loaned out. With Lisandro Martinez expected to return from injury within the next few months, if the centre-back can regain match fitness quickly, it would provide sufficient defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to gain more experience of first-team football.",
      "Chido Obi might be another player heading out on loan. Despite making his United debut last season, the striker hasn't made a matchday squad this season and has been playing for the U21 team. A loan spell could give him more exposure to first-team football in the second half of the season, potentially returning as an improved player.",
      "Tyrell Malacia could be on the verge of a permanent exit. The full-back was rumoured to be leaving in the summer, but a transfer never came to fruition.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton.",
      "Defenders: Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven, Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw, Diego Leon, Denzel Dumfries, Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Midfielders: Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount.",
      "Forwards: Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko, Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim will face the axe by Christmas unless he changes his tactics at Manchester United, according to Sir Alex Ferguson's trusted lieutenant Rene Meulensteen. The Portuguese manager Amorim has struggled to spark a notable turnaround at Old Trafford this season.",
      "That's despite securing significant investment from the board during the summer window and enjoying a complete pre-season programme to settle his squad. The 40-year-old endured a 1-0 defeat against Arsenal on the opening weekend, before managing a stalemate with Fulham and claiming victory over newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "However, Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium exposed holes in Amorim's game, with Manchester City cruising to a 3-0 win on home turf while United struggled to find their rhythm. With fixtures against Chelsea, Liverpool and Brighton looming in their next five matches, Meulensteen believes the signs are deeply concerning.",
      "The former United first-team coach, who won three Premier League titles with Ferguson as well as the Champions League, told football betting site BetVictor: \"Could Ruben Amorim be gone before Christmas?",
      "\"Absolutely, he could well be. And I think if he keeps being as stubborn as he is and the results don't improve, he doesn't keep winning, then there's definitely no other way than the club has to make a decision.",
      "\"I mean, how long are you going to keep traveling in the wrong direction? Every game and every week it's like, 'Well, let's hope and see what we get this week.' Maybe you get the odd result like you did against Burnley, with a last-minute penalty to get that one over the line. Otherwise, they would have not won a game.",
      "\"They've got some tough, tough fixtures coming up, but like I said, there is definitely a possibility he goes in the next few months. If you lose to City, 3-0, but all the pundits can understand, it wasn't a 3-0 game, United really played well, they were unlucky, then maybe it would be different.",
      "\"But that wasn't the case. If the performances are not good and the results are not there, then you're going to get this question from week to week. It's just a continuation of the poor start to the season, which I was afraid of.",
      "\"I said he actually needs to win seven to eight of his first 10 games to reinforce that he has been able to do some work and that he believes in what he wants to do. But all this gets overshadowed by performances and results like this.",
      "\"You continuously get the same questions and reactions in the media about the system, and he says he won't change. He says if anything is going to change, then they have to change him. If he keeps that approach, then I think there's only one way he's heading: to the exit.",
      "\"I can't see anything different. So where does that leave United again? Where they left off last year, and that's where you don't want to be.\"",
      "The head coach was given the go-ahead to splash the cash this summer, spending over £200million on players like Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, while also bolstering his goalkeeping options with the signing of Senne Lammens following poor performances from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana.",
      "With a challenging match against Chelsea at Old Trafford looming this Saturday, supporters are keen to see a better performance from United. However, Enzo Maresca has built a formidable squad this summer, as shown by their four-match unbeaten run in the league, and could prove too hot to handle.",

      "Phil Foden opened the scoring before Erling Haaland bagged a brace as United endured their second defeat in four Premier League outings. It's nearly a year since Erik ten Hag got his marching orders, with Amorim brought in as his successor at the beginning of November last year.",
      "However, the Portuguese head coach has given little indication he possesses the skills to turn United's fortunes around, despite splashing almost £200million on transfers this summer. Amorim's biggest critics point to his stubborn insistence on sticking with his preferred 3-4-3 formation, regardless of poor results.",
      "Former United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster reckons that inflexibility could soon see the 40-year-old shown the door as fans and players lose faith.",
      "\"It's been rumbling for a long time,\" the ex-England goalkeeper said on his Fozcast podcast. \"Nobody wants to really commit to it [sacking Amorim] but I guarantee you that if they've got eight points and they're still in 14th position after eight games, somebody's going to have to pull the trigger.",
      "\"It can't carry on like that. It's nearly a year since he's been managing and it's been proven that it's not working. I get that he wants to play that system, but if you haven't got the players, you can't play it. Surely you just play your best players in their best position, because then you'll get the best out of them.\"",
      "Amorim received leeway during his first campaign after steering his squad to a dismal 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term. It's reported that he continues to enjoy support from the United hierarchy at present despite the club's poorest start to a season in 33 years.",
      "However, former England goalkeeper coach Dave Watson, who features on Foster's podcast, has also challenged Amorim's qualifications.",
      "\"I don't believe he is a top coach, because you have to have a different way [of playing],\" he said. \"You're at the top of the tree in terms of Man United and the Premier League and the opposition coaches are too good for you to be stuck in your ways.",
      "\"I thought City really dominated from start to finish. We always have the same debate about Amorim, but he's not prepared to adapt in any way, shape or form the tactics of the game.",
      "\"He's getting beat tactically all the time by opposition managers and the opposition players are too good in that game against Man United. It's a simple as that.\"",
      "United are bracing themselves for a difficult challenge on Saturday as they host an undefeated Chelsea at Old Trafford in the Premier League. Enzo Maresca's squad, currently sitting fifth in the league table, have kicked off their campaign with two victories and two draws from their first four matches.",

      "There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and people questioning the future of the Manchester United manager.",
      "Sources reiterated Ruben Amorim retains the backing of the board following a bruising defeat to Manchester City, but it's clear Amorim desperately needs results.",
      "Sack the manager, hire a new coach and usher in an exciting new era by spending in the transfer market. That is the nature of football, but United have become specialists in failure when the club has been built on success.",
      "Amorim needed a fast start after overseeing the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years, but United have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years.",
      "The situation is depressingly familiar, and you only have to look back to last season to see a United manager who needed to start the campaign well, failed to do so, and was axed.",
      "It was the wrong decision to keep Erik ten Hag after the FA Cup final triumph. Ten Hag managed to survive the September and October international breaks, United scraped a win against Brentford, drew against Fenerbahce and the Dutchman was finally shown the door after a defeat to West Ham on October 27.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked the day after the loss to the Hammers. The season was still salvageable at that stage, but United did not enjoy a new manager bounce when Amorim was appointed in November.",
      "The October international break is synonymous with managerial sackings. History tells you the next few weeks are crucial for Amorim.",
      "United could beat Chelsea this weekend and enjoy further wins against Brentford and Sunderland before the October break, but Amorim is yet to win successive league games during his tenure.",
      "United's head coach has the unwanted record of having the lowest win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "It's not unthinkable that Amorim could turn the ship around, but the number of fans who doubt he will be a success is increasing, despite the vocal support for the 40-year-old at Old Trafford.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the Burnley win. Banners were unfurled, flags were flown, and one had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction to Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the message. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around\".",
      "The fanbase is split on, just as it was with Ten Hag, although the situation with Amorim is not as grave as it was in the final weeks of Ten Hag's reign.",
      "Having said that, Ineos' decision to sack Ten Hag just nine game into the 2024/25 Premier League campaign shows they are open to the idea of an early change, and United play Chelsea, Brentford, Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking.",
      "The Liverpool fixture at Anfield immediately after the international break already looks ominous. Arne Slot's side are favourites to win the Premier League title and could smell blood when United visit next month.",
      "Four games into the Premier League season, it feels ridiculous that the conversation around Amorim's future has started, but results dictate the narrative and United only have four points.",
      "Just last month, someone who has worked at United for six years said the mood in the camp was \"genuinely different\" this summer. Pre-season was full of positivity, Amorim boosted morale by looking to cut ties with anyone who didn't have a future at the club and there was excitement about what could be achieved.",

      "If there is a team that can turn the apparent advantage of no European football into a disadvantage it is Manchester United.",
      "Already, the six or seven-day gap between games feel inauspicious. The downbeat mood festers for longer and there is not even a League Cup third round tie to play and fuel confidence that can be channelled into the next weekend fixture.",
      "One of the reasons why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in such immediate peril after United's 5-0 shellacking by Liverpool four years ago was that they did not have a midweek match. United were caught short and had no succession plan, so Solskjaer limped on for another four weeks.",
      "But the club had decided he would have to go and began devising a plan, incurring two more damaging defeats to Manchester City and Watford. In the Sir Elton John Stand at Vicarage Road, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Louis van Gaal only survived United's Boxing Day loss at Stoke - their fourth in a row - due to the tight turnaround. They hosted Chelsea two days later and performed spiritedly in a watchable goalless draw.",
      "The weeks drag in the wake of a defeat. United's next three fixtures are all Saturday kick-offs, so the gaps will be a day longer than the six days between City and Chelsea.",
      "Then it is another international fortnight. United had decided by last year's October internationals that Erik ten Hag would go. It was just a case of when. Inexplicably, they swung the axe three games after the October internationals.",
      "There was a rendition of \"sacked in the morning\" at the Etihad on Sunday. Ten Hag was dismissed on a Monday last year. That gave Ruud van Nistelrooy a full week in caretaker charge. United are not wavering on Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have one win from their opening five games, as they did in their last campaign devoid of European football in 2014-15. United did not maximise their lighter workload that season and scraped fourth place with one win from their final six games.",
      "Their season was salvaged by two six-game winning sequences in the winter and the spring. The latter featured victories against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City that remain among United's best against those sides in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "It was during that sprightly spring that Van Gaal settled on a winning formula. Six days after Arsenal ended United's chances of silverware in the FA Cup quarter-final, Van Gaal paired Chris Smalling with Phil Jones, moved Daley Blind to left back and recalled Juan Mata to the right wing. United were 3-0 up against Spurs at half-time.",
      "United were unchanged a week later at Liverpool, where they produced what remains their best performance at Anfield since the back-to-back 3-1 triumphs in 1997. That same XI started the Manchester derby three weeks later when United battered City 4-2.",
      "Amorim has made six changes across United's four league games. He has only ever picked an unchanged XI once, at Lyon four days after the goalless Old Trafford derby.",
      "Losing to a City side devoid of their fear factor and beaten in their previous two games by tactically astute teams warrants a major rethink. Amorim is never going to compromise on the failing 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to and his stubbornness extends to some selections.",
      "Overpromoting Altay Bayindir to first choice has not worked. Amorim said Bayindir could be like Edwin van der Sar. He is not as good as Raimond van der Gouw and Senne Lammens may as well go in goal sooner rather than later.",
      "Amorim talked his way into trouble by labelling Luke Shaw, who has broken the 40-appearance barrier in three out of 11 seasons, \"world-class\". Shaw has been reinvented as a centre half but remains an auxiliary option and Amorim has reduced Harry Maguire to a goalscoring impact sub.",
      "Managers can be too dogmatic about right-footed and left-footed centre backs and a few of them (Van Gaal, Amorim and Erik ten Hag) have ended up at United. United are better off with Maguire than Shaw. Maguire played on the left of a back three of only the third England team to reach a World Cup semi-final.",
      "For a 24-year-old, Manuel Ugarte is too naive as the designated defensive midfielder. Fulham coach Marco Silva and winger Alex Iwobi admitted they preyed on United's numerical disadvantage in midfield last month as their centre backs \"want to jump\". Ugarte has to take a back seat otherwise Amorim will revert to the less mobile Casemiro.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' redeployment in midfield is anathema to many accustomed to seeing him higher up the pitch yet he excelled from deep in the second half of last season, so much so he scored a hat-trick from there against Real Sociedad. United have a surfeit of No.10s and a paucity of midfield options. Keeping Fernandes further back is better for the team's balance but his defensive shortcomings have to be cut out and can be if Ugarte stays deeper.",
      "The wingers are a growing concern. Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu are inadequate in the final third. Given Amorim's preference for a left-footer on the left wing, Amad is worth a go as he is a superior footballer to the raw Dorgu.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are certain picks as the two playmakers when both are fit. Benjamin Sesko is pleading for time but his time could be up before he knows it unless he starts scoring. He has to consistently start, at least until the October internationals.",
      "The October international fortnight will be scrapped next year. The bad news is the September break will be extended to three weeks.",
      "Woe betide United if they are still out of Europe then.",

      "United have told fans \"academy players and staff would greatly appreciate your support\" but they have decided to significantly raise ticket prices for the academy fixture against Bilbao.",
      "In November, United charged £3 for adults and £1.50 for children to watch the Under-19s against AZ Alkmaar at Old Trafford. That meant the total cost for one adult and one child to attend that game was £4.50, yet the same tickets for the clash with Bilbao will now cost £15 - a 233% increase.",
      "The U21s play their home fixtures in the league at Leigh Sports Village, which is 13 miles away from Old Trafford, and tickets for those fixtures have previously been free of charge.",
      "Ticket prices have been a source of controversy since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in United last year.",
      "United made the mid-season decision to raise matchday ticket prices to £66 per game in the Premier League, with no concessions for children or pensioners.",
      "Fans organised protests against the price hike and Ratcliffe added fuel to the fire in his interview with the United We Stand magazine, saying that \"it doesn't make sense\" for a United ticket to cost less than a ticket to watch London-club Fulham.",

      "\"I don't want to end up in a position where the genuine local fans can't afford to come, but I do want to optimise the ticketing. We need to find a balance. And you can't be popular all the time either. Here, we're talking about three per cent of the tickets. That's not the issue.",
      "\"The issue, as you say, is whether this is the thin edge of the wedge. I don't think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.\"",
      "Told that wages are higher in London, Ratcliffe continued: \"I get that. I'm not sure there's an answer that keeps everybody happy, but we need to keep the majority happy.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim needed to start the new season well, but it has not gone as planned for Manchester United.",
      "United responded to their shock defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup by securing a win against Burnley before the international break, but a hammering against Manchester City soon followed next.",
      "Phil Foden opened the scoring in the 18th minute of the Manchester derby at the Etihad last weekend and Erling Haaland scored twice in the second half to seal a comfortable 3-0 victory.",
      "The second inquest of the season has started at Old Trafford. The pressure on Amorim increased after Grimsby and the derby defeat has cranked up the noise around his future.",
      "United have made their worst start to a season since 1992/93, when they also had four points from their four matches under Sir Alex Ferguson, and Amorim has the unwanted record of having the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "So, what's next for Amorim? We've had a look at how he should respond to the City defeat.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best player and Amorim is not getting the best out of him. Fernandes has made a poor start to the campaign and failed to track Phil Foden's run for the opening goal last weekend.",
      "Last month, Fernandes made the same mistake against Fulham at Craven Cottage when he didn't track Emile Smith Rowe, which shows he is struggling with the role's defensive aspects.",
      "The evidence from the opening few weeks of the season suggests Fernandes should be relocated further up the pitch.",
      "That means Fernandes would have to rotate with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the No.10 roles and minutes would have to be shared, but playing him in the pivot isn't working.",
      "Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Fernandes to start in midfield.",
      "In the final days of the summer transfer window, Mainoo requested to leave on loan for the sake of regular starts, but Amorim insisted that the youngster would stay and fight for his place.",
      "Fans have questioned why such a talented young player felt a change of scenery was necessary. Amorim has argued Mainoo is not the finished article, but the midfield is an issue and Mainoo could be a solution.",
      "It's time to play Mainoo and give him a consistent run of games in the midfield pivot. He started for England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final and has too much talent to be limited to substitute appearances.",
      "Mainoo thrived playing alongside Casemiro in his breakout season and that would be a logical partnership for the three games against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the international break.",
      "Altay Bayindir and Luke Shaw should lose their starting roles on the back of the derby defeat. Bayindir was not to blame for the loss, by any means, but he was shaky from the first whistle and should have done better for Erling Haaland's first goal, as he went to the ground too easily.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted screaming at Bayindir after City's third goal, trying to encourage his goalkeeper to keep his head up, and the Turkey international's confidence looks shattered.",
      "Senne Lammens is an unknown quantity, despite having a strong reputation in Belgium, but the bar is low to impress. Lammens needs to start against Chelsea, and another defensive change is required.",
      "Shaw had his worst game for United since his return from injury. The 30-year-old has started each Premier League game on the left of the back-three, but Harry Maguire should now replace him in the team.",
      "Amorim hasn't helped himself by picking players in the wrong positions, while his tendency to tweak the starting team each week has made it difficult for United to build momentum.",
      "Having a settled team might improve their chances of success, so Amorim should stick with the same starting XI for each game up until the October international break.",
      "This XI makes sense: Lammens, Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Mainoo, Mbeumo, Sesko, Fernandes.",
      "That line-up is dependent on Diogo Dalot returning from injury against Chelsea.",
      "It's ridiculous that United have entered must-win territory just four league games into the season, but if Chelsea win at Old Trafford, the talk around Amorim's future will intensify.",
      "United should target at least six points from Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland. The October international break will be an opportunity to assess Amorim and positive results are required to safeguard his future.",
      "The Reds found a way to win against Burnley before the September international break. That was key after Grimsby and it's just as important to bounce back against Chelsea.",

      "\"I can't see how this manager is avoiding the sack,\" a Manchester United season-ticket holder who was in the away end at the Etihad messaged. \"He’s had a free pass until now and it was always the case that he had to start the season well. He certainly hasn’t.\"",
      "Another was in the lower tier and remained until the end. \"Personally, I think he's finished,\" he admitted. \"Loads of reds want him to do well but there's nothing at all to say he's the man.\"",
      "\"He's getting hammered in the pub,\" another said. He was not referring to Ruben Amorim drowning his sorrows.",
      "\"Amorim is like a pigeon,\" another messaged, \"endlessly crashing into a glass window, dazed and stubborn, convinced he’ll break through if he just keeps at it.\"",
      "This is not the United matchgoers outright turning against Amorim. They are just resigned to another in-season managerial change.",
      "Amorim fronts up in defeat by strolling onto the pitch to applaud the supporters. There were only a handful remaining in the three tiers of the Etihad's South Stand at full-time on Sunday.",
      "City scoring at least three times, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland on the scoresheet, an emptying away end and an empty feeling. We have become accustomed to this watching United in derbies over the past 12 years. Amorim copped similar treatment to David Moyes, Jose Mourinho, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.",
      "And even if Amorim survives long enough to brave the red flares outside Anfield next month, Liverpool have form for immediately, or eventually, seeing off a United manager.",
      "Moyes was sacked 37 days after a 3-0 defeat. Van Gaal was sacked 74 days after a 2-0 defeat. Mourinho was sacked two days after a 3-1 defeat. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked 28 days after a 5-0 drubbing. Ten Hag was sacked 57 days after a 3-0 defeat.",
      "One sensed at Grimsby that Amorim had gone past the point of no return. That it was in the League Cup and on penalties barely tempered the nuclear fallout from that humiliation. Some players who started that night are unlikely to ever play for United again.",
      "The summer recruitment already appears dubious. United have the ingredients for an appetising filling but their sandwich crumbles with a flaky base and top.",
      "It is on Amorim that he promoted Altay Bayindir to first choice. In 15 appearances for United, Bayindir has conceded 26 goals.",
      "Senne Lammens is inexperienced, such an unknown quantity he was at United's original feeder club, and was not one of the four goalkeepers in the Belgium squad this month. He is due a chance sooner rather than later for the sake of variety.",
      "Benjamin Sesko had his most accomplished outing for United at City yet fired blanks again. It is seven goalless games for club and country this season. Rasmus Hojlund, typically, has found the back of the net for club and country since he fled the United maelstrom.",
      "Luke Shaw's stint as an auxiliary centre back may be over. Amorim, like Ten Hag, favours a left-footer on the left of central defence. The more sensible strategy would be to pick an actual centre back.",
      "Entrusting Shaw in the Europa League final backfired and it was a matter of time until it did so again this season. Harry Maguire is a specialist centre half and a better defender than Shaw but has been reduced to an impact substitute capable of increasing United's lowly goal threat.",
      "United's script on their weakened midfield has already come back to haunt them. Club sources claimed the area was never their priority in the transfer window given the \"strong and versatile options available\".",
      "Casemiro's only memorable performances this calendar year were restricted to the Europa League and United are not in Europe. Kobbie Mainoo has not started a league game since May, with Manuel Ugarte recalled ahead of him in the derby despite his first-half horror show at Grimsby.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are not specialists. Mount has got injured in the second league fixture in each of his three seasons with United and then been sidelined for at least three weeks.",
      "Three opponents have scored against United through runs from deep. Fernandes was at the scene of the crime again for Phil Foden's 18th-minute header.",
      "Amorim clutched at straws. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" he said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",
      "\"Against Arsenal, do you think we play well?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think we are the better team?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders?\"",
      "Yes.",
      "\"They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno. Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated that United would only stop playing in the 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to if they change manager. If he suddenly switched to a back four, United would not necessarily look much better.",
      "Lammens in goal, Noussair Mazraoui at right back, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt at centre half and Patrick Dorgu at left back, with Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as the No.10 with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha either side and Benjamin Sesko up front does not scream Champions League qualifying contenders.",
      "And as enterprising as United were against Arsenal, they lost without scoring to a team that did not perform and protected a 13th-minute goal gifted to them.",
      "That does not grant the manager a free pass.",

      "United are in 14th place after four games and out of the Carabao Cup via a shock loss to Grimsby Town on Penalties. Their only victory of the season came against Burnley, who are three places below them.",
      "As a result, talk is starting to intensify over whether Amorim is the right man for the job.",

      "With his future at Old Trafford uncertain under Ruben Amorim, Sancho joined the Villains on loan this summer, and finally entered the fray for the Premier League side in an EFL Cup clash with Brentford.",
      "Taking to social media to mark the event, Sancho wrote: \"Happy to make my debut @avfcofficial, not the result we wanted but something to build on,\" after the Villains were knocked out of the competition on penalties.

Reports in Portugal now say he is set to return to Estadio da Luz as Benfica react to their embarrassing Champions League loss to Qarabag, the Mirror reports.",
      "Gabby Agbonlahor has claimed that Ruben Amorim wants to be put out of his misery at Manchester United. The former Aston Villa star told talkSPORT: \"The club's in a mess and if there's ever been a manager who has shown in his recent press conferences that he wants to be sacked, it's Ruben Amorim.",

      "The Portuguese tactician has failed to bring about a marked improvement at Old Trafford so far this season, despite receiving a substantial backing from the board over the summer and being afforded a full pre-season tour to settle his squad. The 40-year-old suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on opening day, before mustering a draw against Fulham and a win over a newly-promoted Burnley.",
      "However, Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium showed major holes in Amorim's system, as Manchester City ran out 3-0 winners on home soil while United failed to get going. And with the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Brighton to play across their next five outings, Meulensteen believes that the outlook is far from positive.",

      "Mainoo, 20, has only started one game in all competitions this season, failing to help the Reds avoid a humiliating loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. In their four Premier League games, the England international has only been given a combined 73 minutes by United boss Ruben Amorim, who recently told Mainoo that his talent alone is 'not enough'.",
      "Read the full story below...",
      "Speaking via his YouTube channel, Ben Foster suggested Amorim is already being considered for the axe by the ownership, with plans being formulated, though nobody at Old Trafford has officially confirmed desires to dismiss the Portuguese tactician.",

But I guarantee you, if, after eight games, they've got eight points and they're still in 14th or 15th position, somebody's gonna have to pull the trigger because it can't carry on like that because it's been proven now.",

United replaced Ten Hag with Amorim in November last year on a two-and-a-half deal worth £6.5m a season with the option of a 12-month extension.",

      "Despite starting Sunday's defeat at Manchester City, Ugarte has slipped down the pecking order and Romano has revealed just how close they came to offloading him during the summer transfer window.",
      "Confirming Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos' willingness to facilitate his exit after just 12 months, Romano told his YouTube channel: \"I can reveal to you that, for Manuel Ugarte, there was a possibility of an exit this summer.",
      "\"For example, Italian clubs were interested in Ugarte, but Manchester United decided to close the doors to an eventual loan move, so this is why nothing happened.",
      "\"For Manuel Ugarte, we'll have to see if some club will arrive with a permanent deal proposal in 2026, because this might change the situation.\"",
      "Gary Pallister has claimed that Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes would be a star performer for the likes of Real Madrid or Barcelona, but the fact he's playing in a struggling side is impacting his performances.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim played a 4-3-3 formation, he'd get the best out of Bruno Fernandes,\" he told BetWright. \"I don't think the current system suits him at all, which is worrying because Fernandes has been Manchester United's best player for a few seasons now.",
      "\"If he was to walk into a team like Real Madrid or Barcelona, he’d be a star. But he's playing for a United team that is really struggling and probably isn't getting the full credit he deserves.",
      "\"I'm glad Bruno stayed at the club; there was a lot of talk of a move to Saudi in the summer transfer window. I think the fans love him and he’s shown a lot of loyalty by remaining in Manchester.\"",
      "He told Aceodds.com: \"I think it's a really difficult one because they've obviously given him a lot of money to spend. He's been playing this formation, he's already got rid of a few players. The ones you'd sort of class as, I suppose, deadwood.",
      "\"But then if a new manager comes in then you have to change the formation again and start changing the clientele again. I think they'll have to give him till at least Christmas.",
      "\"I think it's gotten to the stage where it's too deep for him to go. It's difficult to change clientele in January. You have to give him a bit of time.\"",

      "No I can't [understand the situation]. He came onto the scene a couple of years ago and I thought 'Wow, what a player'.",
      "His legs have been questioned, but go back to that game yesterday and it's not all about that, they had plenty of possession. Bruno Fernandes can be fine in central midfield when he has hold of the ball.",
      "When you are playing against better teams, there are times when you're not going to have the ball, and that's when you have to know the position brilliantly.",
      "Every manager is clever these days, and Pep is the very best at getting people in behind his midfield. He had Foden doing it and Bernardo doing it.",
      "He had Doku coming inside. I've been there myself, you're constantly looking over your shoulder, thinking where is my man, it's a horrible place to be at times. If you're on the ball all the time, then Fernandes is brilliant [in deeper midfield].",
      "Now Kobbie Mainoo is the same I think on the ball, he can be fantastic, but he needs a proper partner next to him. I don't think Ugarte... he's got the legs but doesn't have the quality.",
      "We know Casemiro had the quality over the years but he's slowed down now. Again, I look at my career, I wasn't the greatest in that position, I didn't know it brilliantly well, but the guy next to me always did.",
      "They knew it so well, Roy Keane, Nicky Butt and Michael Carrick, they were perfect for me. I don't think the partnership is working for any of them because they don't know the position as well as they should.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho appears to be enjoying his time at Chelsea after joining from Manchester United this past summer.",
      "The Argentine made his debut for the Blues this past weekend when he came off the bench against Brentford. It was his cross that resulted in Moises Caicedo scoring what looked to be the winner until an equaliser arrived late in the day.",
      "However, he seems to be enjoying his time in west London with Garnacho uploading a picture to Instagram as he and his teammates prepare for a Champions League clash away to Bayern Munich at Cobham training ground.",
      "Manuel Ugarte could leave Manchester United in an upcoming transfer window.",
      "The central midfielder, signed from Paris Saint-Germain in a deal that could reach £52million, has struggled since arriving at Old Trafford but his nightmare spell could soon be over.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, there are clubs in Italy's Serie A interested in signing him. It has also been noted that United would only consider a permanent sale over a loan exit.",
      "Former Premier League strike has named two very different candidates that could replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United if he is sacked.",
      "In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton. For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "Zinedine Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have.",
      "I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'He said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",

      "With so much uncertainty surrounding his position, it has become a hotly debated topic with MEN's Bruna Reis having her say...",
      "It’s becoming increasingly unclear where Manchester United go from here. Nearly a year has passed since Amorim was appointed as Erik ten Hag’s successor, and despite the time, little progress has been made.",
      "The start to this season has been particularly disappointing, with the team winning just one of their opening four games.",
      "Amorim has consistently refused to compromise on his footballing philosophy, sticking rigidly to his principles. While this approach brought him success in Portugal, it has yet to yield results at United.",
      "The tactics that once worked at Sporting Clube de Portugal are struggling to translate in the Premier League, leaving fans frustrated. At this stage, it may be time for Amorim to adapt, make pragmatic changes and inject fresh ideas into the squad if he wants to turn this situation around.",
      "Manchester United's three midfield targets endured very different but ultimately disappointing weekends.",

      "He told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"I had two options: Liverpool or Juventus.",
      "\"I spoke to both clubs, then my heart drew me to Italy.",
      "\"Serie A was the best league at the time, Juventus was a historic club and had beaten us in the Champions League final in 1996.\"",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has launched a scathing assessment after their 3-0 defeat at Man City.",
      "He said: “Where do you start with it all? We talk about his philosophy, his style of play, the way he wants to play. Now, there’s so many clever coaches in the Premier League and around the world and they work it out quite easily.",
      "\"They know exactly the way Manchester United are going to play.",
      "\"The team sheet always came through an hour before kick-off, you always look at the players and the manager would say, ‘I wonder how they’re going to play today?'",
      "\"Trying to work out whether they’re going to play five at the back, four at the back, with Amorim, they know. Everybody knows so it’s easy to work out and play against because the coaches are that clever.",

      "Jose Mourinho is set to secure a swift return to the dugout, with Benfica poised to install him as manager by the weekend following Bruno Lage's dismissal. The Portuguese heavyweights had reportedly been eyeing Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, but have now struck a deal with Mourinho.",
      "Mourinho, who left Fenerbahce in August, previously guided the Lisbon club through 11 matches during his first ever managerial stint in 2000. Portuguese media outlets now suggest he's preparing for an imminent comeback at Estadio da Luz as Benfica respond to their humiliating Champions League defeat against Qarabag.",
      "Lage bore the brunt of criticism after surrendering a 2-0 advantage on home soil and was dismissed in the early hours of Wednesday. Benfica president Rui Costa declared that a managerial change was essential following the poor result as they strive to reclaim their status as Portugal's dominant force.",
      "He expressed his determination to move swiftly, with CNN Portugal claiming that a preliminary agreement with Mourinho has been secured, whilst both parties work to finalise contractual terms. Costa stated: \"Regarding the next coach, we expect to have the new one on the bench at Vila das Aves next Saturday.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Mourinho, 62, has a legendary status within Portuguese football. It was at Porto where the former United manager initially established his credentials, achieving domestic supremacy whilst capturing both the UEFA Cup and Champions League in consecutive campaigns before his switch to Chelsea, reports the Mirror.",
      "Should Benfica secure Mourinho's services, it could potentially eliminate a potential exit route for Amorim, whose position at United remains increasingly uncertain. Amorim has overseen United's worst start to a season in 33 years.",
      "Asked if he fears getting sacked after the weekend defeat to Manchester City, Amorim said: \"Guys, I understand that and I accept.",
      "\"It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message.",
      "\"It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",
      "The frontrunner to become Benfica's next president, Joao Noronha Lopes, made the journey to Manchester last weekend to witness Amorim's team suffer a 3-0 defeat to rivals City at the Etihad. Lopes has been open about his ambitions to lure Amorim back to Benfica should he triumph over Costa in next month's presidential race.",
      "In a recent interview with Record, he was candid about his respect for Amorim - though he stopped short of confirming any appointment plans.",
      "He said: \"Ruben Amorim? He's a great coach, he has a contract with Manchester United. I won't comment on that. Of course I like him. He's a great coach and a Benfica fan. I don't have a contract for Ruben to sign.\"",
      "Lopes' running mate as vice-president would be Nuno Gomes - one of Amorim's closest allies who shared the pitch with him for both Benfica and Portugal - and the former forward has been emphatic that he envisions the United manager returning to Lisbon eventually.",
      "When questioned about the possibility of his comeback, he stated: \"Ruben Amorim is the coach of Manchester United, I can't answer that question. One thing I know, Ruben Amorim will be the coach of Benfica one day.\"",

      "Former Newcastle United midfielder Elliot Anderson is on Manchester United's radar for a potential transfer, according to former Old Trafford scout Mick Brown.",
      "Anderson, who made 55 first-team appearances for the Magpies after rising through their youth system, moved to Nottingham Forest in July 2024 for a hefty £35million fee.",
      "The decision to let the then 22-year-old go was met with some criticism, but Eddie Howe's side had to make sales to adhere to Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules. At the same time, reserve goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos was sold to Newcastle for £20m.",
      "There were concerns that Newcastle might rue letting Anderson go, given his potential to become a top-tier Premier League player, and it seems he is now realising that potential.",
      "Indeed, Anderson was instrumental in helping Forest secure a seventh-place finish last season and a spot in this season's Europa League. His impressive form has continued into this campaign, earning him an England senior debut under Thomas Tuchel against Andorra earlier this month.",
      "After a standout performance and bagging the Player of the Match award, Anderson earned his second cap for England's match against Serbia, where he once again shone.",
      "With Anderson making waves at both Forest and England, speculation about his future is mounting. According to ex-United chief Brown, the Reds are contemplating a move.",
      "\"Man United have been looking at Anderson,\" Brown told Football Insider. \"He's done a tremendous job at Nottingham Forest and then he's come into the England side and turned in a man-of-the-match performance. United see him as exactly the type of midfielder they would like to bring in.",
      "\"He gets up and down the park, he's confident and secure in possession of the ball, and he's not afraid to put in a tackle, which is something they need.",
      "\"Anderson would solve, or certainly help with, a lot of the issues they've had under Amorim. Everybody knows they wanted a midfielder in the summer but they couldn't find the right one who was available at the price they wanted.",
      "\"I don't know what Anderson would cost, but he is somebody who's been on their radar. He would be the ideal player to fill the gaps they've had in the squad.\"",
      "Reports have indicated that Forest rate Anderson at a minimum of £70m - twice what the Reds paid for him just over 12 months ago. Currently, it's believed the midfielder has no intention of departing The City Ground.",
      "However, should he make the switch to Manchester, would Newcastle be entitled to some money as part of a possible sell-on arrangement?",
      "As per Chronicle Live, the Magpies do not possess a buy-back provision despite suggestions that the club can trigger particular clauses in his deal with Forest. Should Newcastle desire Anderson's return, they would need to pay the full market rate for the midfielder, with his worth rising after each display, presently.",
      "It's been hinted that Newcastle may not have a sell-on clause in Anderson's contract, which could be a significant setback if he is sold for a substantial sum.",
      "Notably, Anderson wasn't the only player Newcastle offloaded to comply with PSR rules last season. The Magpies also transferred Yankuba Minteh to Brighton and Hove Albion in a deal valued at about £30m.",
      "However, the decision to let Anderson go was always seen as a potential regret - and it appears to be so.",

      "The club sanctioned a significant summer transfer spend in order to address last season's glaring weakness, a toothless attack. Amorim needed a fast start to put the nightmare of the 2024/25 campaign behind him, but defeats to Arsenal and Manchester City, a draw with Fulham, and a nervy last-minute win against Burnley have done little to settle fans' nerves.",
      "Amorim retains the support of the club hierarchy for now, and he is under contract until 2027. He has signalled that he will continue to resist calls to change his system in an attempt to improve results, saying: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Some fans say that sacking Amorim is not the road back to success at Old Trafford. Reader Utd20T says: \"Amorim is certainly not out of his depth as some suggest. He's actually tackled many issues since his arrival. The system wasn't at fault for the defeat [against Man City]. All three goals were due to errors - lack of focus and aggression - something we've witnessed under different managers and different systems.",
      "\"The system isn't perfect but neither is a 4-3-3 or any system. We still need additions to the team but that can't be fixed in one summer. Of course Amorim does need results, but losing to City and Arsenal isn't the disaster it has been portrayed to be.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Commenter Anniemause writes: \"Whilst it's clear Amorim's out of his depth he's not the only one. From Ratcliffe down, Ineos seem totally incapable of running the football side of the club. The first 15 months have been littered with bad footballing decisions and absolutely no good ones, let alone inspired ones.",
      "\"Given it's unlikely United could parachute in a manager to replace Amorim with the sort of Premier League experience needed to turn around this situation, it may be the prudent course to keep him on board and change things above him. In that way it minimises further disruption to the squad in their day to day activities. Expecting the squad to adapt to another management style might break them completely.\"",
      "Jambon1968 pleads with Amorim to compromise: \"I really like Amorim and I want him to succeed, but it is almost like he is talking himself out of a job... he could easily switch the formation and has the players to do it, and I just can't understand why he wouldn't at least want to give it a try... can it really get any worse? Wilcox needs to talk this out and if he really can't adapt, it's probably never going to work.\"",
      "Tt84 writes: \"I'm happy to give him until the end of October. It's always darkest before the light... In the build up play, the passing, the getting forward, we look good. That is despite the fact our midfield is lacking, and despite the fact we have had shocking goalkeepers.",
      "\"Our problem is that we cant get the ball under the net. Give him chance to try and fix it.\"",
      "Reddeadhead says: \"Is there an available manager out there who can rescue United from this mess?\"",
      "Others can't see Amorim remaining in his post for much longer. IlSacristano writes: \"I feel sorry for Amorim. He is a good bloke. But just as much as is said about players not having PL experience goes for managers too. I think he is young and out of his depth. All the cracks in his system are being exploited because United's game is so predictable. Sadly I don't think he will make it to Christmas.\"",
      "Fastag thinks it's a simple decision: \"Amorim should be sacked immediately, because how can you keep a manager who won only 8 games in 31 Premier League games? Even a team without a manager will not have a record like this.\"",
      "Have your say! What conditions should Amorim meet in order to continue as United manager? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.",

The report also names Oliver Glasner of Crystal Palace, Marco Silva of Fulham, former England boss Gareth Southgate and United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino as potential successors to Amorim.",
      "If Iraola is appointed, it could boost United's chances of signing Semenyo either in January or next summer. The Bournemouth star has been heavily linked with a move away from the Cherries for several months, with Tottenham Hotspur also mentioned as a potential destination.",

As well as losing the first Manchester derby of the season against Manchester City, the Reds crashed out of the Carabao Cup to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "With a record of just eight wins from 31 Premier League games, Amorim shouldn't be surprised that his future is in doubt. Although the club hierarchy insists the head coach retains their full backing, The Mirror have reported that there are five candidates to replace the Portuguese according to the bookmakers.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, Gareth Southgate, Fulham's Marco Silva and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola are all on their radar. Current USA head coach Mauricio Pochettino is also in the frame should Amorim exit.",
      "The report also states that those at the top of Old Trafford will assess the situation and the team's trajectory after the next three games. They take on Chelsea, Brentford, and Sunderland before the next international break.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"It's fair to say that the reaction to these names speaks volumes. Southgate is a name Ineos are known to like. Pochettino has also been linked before to Glasner. Iraola and Silva all fit the mould of 'hopeful' appointments.",
      "\"After failing with Ten Hag, United would repeat previous mistakes by sacking one manager with another with some sort of risk attached.\"",
      "The Daily Mail reported that United would have to cough up £12million if they decide to axe Amorim. The Portuguese signed a two-and-a-half-year contract when he replaced Erik ten Hag, and should he be axed before the one-year anniversary on November 1, United would face paying a hefty fee.",
      "The deadline is in seven weeks, and Amorim's coaching staff is understood to be in line for a pay-off. The club has already paid over £54m in compensation to five previous bosses, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer receiving the most at £10.5m.",
      "Furthermore, the report states that several figures close to the United first-team are increasingly concerned about his continued nature to hide 'when the going gets tough' in matches.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"For a club that failed to qualify for Europe and has known financial problems, United's constant approval of manager sackings and costly compensations is not a good look.",
      "\"It goes back to what was previously said, United have to, if they sack Amorim, get his replacement spot on to avoid being in a similar situation.\"",

      "Manchester United suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Phil Foden scored the opening goal in the 18th minute, finding the corner with a header after some excellent work from Jeremy Doku.",
      "Erling Haaland scored early in the second half and then added another with just over 20 minutes remaining to take the game away from United.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Bayindir's confidence is shattered",
      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Amie is a football writer covering clubs across the country, she has been a football fan all of her life and supports Leicester City. She graduated with a degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology in 2015. Amie has previous experience in local radio in Leicester and Leicestershire.",
      "It has been a disappointing start to the Premier League season for Manchester United.",
      "One win, one draw, and two losses in their first four games of the season have left them in 14th place in the table, with four points from a possible 12 available. A 3-0 loss against rivals Manchester City on Sunday afternoon was one to forget for United fans.",
      "It has also raised questions again about Ruben Amorim's future. The summer transfer window saw the club spend around £200 million on new players, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The first games of the campaign have, however, shown the problems that remain in the squad. With the summer transfer window now closed, work will have to be done in January to address those issues.",
      "Amid growing pressure on his position, Amorim may already be looking to the work he can do when the window reopens if he is still at the club. Addressing problems in the winter window could relieve some of the pressure on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Here’s a look at what a dream January window could look like for Amorim and United.",
      "There’s no doubt that midfield reinforcements should be the priority for United going into the January window. The club did make moves for players in the summer.",
      "Brighton’s strong not-for-sale stance on Carlos Baleba caused them to walk away from any potential deal. But United could potentially try again in January in the hope that the Seagulls may be more open to a sale.",
      "If that’s the case, then negotiations could start, with an agreement between all parties hopefully being reached. The arrival of Baleba could potentially help give Bruno Fernandes more freedom, even if he is playing in a deeper midfield role.",
      "Another player linked with United in the last few days is Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson. The player caught the eye with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia in the international break.",
      "The former Newcastle man has shown how he can control games and dictate the play, something that United have been missing so far this season. However, like with Baleba, a deal may not be easy to do with Forest, who will be keen to keep hold of a key player, especially during the first transfer window with Ange Postecoglou at the helm.",
      "Away from midfield, one other area where United probably need more cover is at right-back. Currently, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the two recognised right-backs in the squad.",
      "An injury or suspension to just one will leave United short on options. United have again been linked with an interest in Inter’s Denzel Dumfries.",
      "The full-back has recently admitted that he would be open to a Premier League move, and would add experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United did complete the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two deeper midfielders in the January window, then it would allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on loan for the second half of the season. The midfielder outlined his desire to leave on a temporary deal during the summer, but United refused.",
      "If the club can add to their midfield options, then it would free up the academy graduate to go out and get regular game time.",
      "Another player who could go out on loan is Tyler Fredricson. Lisandro Martinez is expected to be back from injury in the next couple of months, if the centre-back can get up to speed quickly then it would provide enough defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to go out and get more games.",
      "Chido Obi could be a third candidate to go out on loan. After making his United debut last season, the striker is yet to make a matchday squad this season, and has been back playing for the U21 squad.",
      "A loan deal could see him get more of a taste for first-team football in the second half of the season, and hopefully return a better player.",
      "One player who could leave permanently is Tyrell Malacia. The full-back was linked with a move away in the summer, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton",

      "Despite being highly regarded in his native Portugal for his outstanding work at Sporting Clube de Portugal - ending their 19-year league title drought and leading them back into Europe - the last few months in England have not been easy for him.",
      "Outsiders are keeping an eye on his situation and reports in Portugal claim he is being considered as a potential manager for Benfica.",

      "Ethan Williams has described the chance to play for Manchester United during the pre-season tour as \"life-changing.\"",
      "United travelled to the United States to compete in the Premier League Summer Series this summer, preparing for the new season with friendlies against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim included a handful of youngsters from the academy in the travelling tour squad. Williams made the cut and scored his first senior goal in a 4-1 win against Bournemouth.",
      "In August, Williams signed for Falkirk on a season-long loan. The forward made 17 appearances during his six-month loan with Cheltenham Town last term and will now try to develop his game in Scotland.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Record, Williams said: “I played about 15 minutes against Bournemouth in Chicago in the summer. We won 4-1 and I scored. The whole team was really warming to me and the other young players. To play and score on tour was life-changing. Something I will never forget.",
      "“Coming off the back of that, getting the opportunity to play here in a good league against good teams is really important to me. I just can’t wait to get my foot in the door and start pushing for starts.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Falkirk, he said: “I’d been speaking to the manager (John McGlynn) and his coaches for quite some time over the summer. Going on tour with United it was quite difficult, communication wise. But once it was set in motion I was ready to come here. I’m happy to be here.",
      "“It’s always good to know that a manager trusts you. For him to come to me and be interested is quite flattering. I’m proud to be here.",
      "“The team has had back-to-back promotions and want to play aggressive football against the top teams. It’s a style I like as a winger. That’s what sold it on me.",
      "“The Scottish Premiership is a very good league, comparable with leagues in England. My first experience of it was good. It was a really proud moment and I’m thankful the manager trusts me and gave me minutes.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as United's Under-18 manager in the summer, but his previous role involved keeping tabs on academy prospects and reporting on their progress.",
      "Williams discussed his relationship with Fletcher, adding: \"I’ve been a United fan for a long time. Him being in the team with the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney, they were the glory days of Man United.",
      "“It’s quite an unreal experience when you step back and think ‘wow’ I’m actually talking with Darren Fletcher. It’s a mad experience for a young kid. But being up here and around it is a good thing.",
      "“Darren was one of the first team assistant coaches, he’s with the U18s now but I’m in contact with him. He knows the game and is a big part of Manchester United. He’s someone that is looking to help me in my journey.",
      "“He’s been asking how everything’s going. I told him I’ve settled well and the team is really welcoming. Everyone is really heartwarming with me and getting around the lads has been a good experience.\"",
      "Williams' professional contract with United started in June 2024 and he was given the chance to train with FC-Lausanne's first team in October as part of an innovative agreement between the Swiss club and United.",
      "Williams joined United's academy from Rochdale at Under-14 level. He is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making more than 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",

      "Ruben Amorim is battling to maintain the trust of his Manchester United squad following their derby humiliation.",
      "United's 3-0 thrashing at Manchester City has intensified the scrutiny on Amorim, with the Portuguese manager now fighting for his position.",
      "It is believed several of United's experienced players have grown increasingly irritated and bewildered by Amorim's stubborn adherence to his tactical approach and formation.",
      "Amorim's rigid formation and his unwillingness to consider alternative setups is said to have sparked significant unease among influential squad members.",
      "Certain United stars are understood to believe Amorim is doing them a disservice by persistently demanding they operate within a system they are ill-suited to, reports the Mirror.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The pressure is building on Amorim to orchestrate a United revival after the disappointing beginning to their campaign, which has yielded just four points from four matches.",
      "United are statistically the worst team of the ever-present top flight sides since his appointment on November 24.",
      "However, the defiant 40 year-old stuck to his guns after the 3-0 defeat to City on Sunday, insisting that he will not alter his system and if the club wants a change they should look elsewhere.",
      "\"Guys, I understand that and I accept,\" Amorim said of his Premier League record. \"It is not a record you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things - you have no idea what happened during these months - but I accept that. I am not going to change.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.",
      "\"My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club. That was always the same message.",
      "\"It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",

      "The return of European football this week means the phony war phase of the 25/26 season is over and real test now begins with a diet of two games a week the order of the day for all the big clubs apart from Manchester United between now and the Busy Festive Period.",
      "Squad depth inevitably becomes a key factor over these next few months, so let’s take the opportunity to rank the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ based on their preparedness for the task.",
      "Obviously Manchester United don’t really belong here, but it’s still fun to look at their second XI anyway, isn’t it? Shut up, it is. And let us tell you this: it’s just as well they haven’t got two games a week.",
      "There are, inevitably, fudges here. There is not really such a thing as ‘first XI’ and ‘second XI’ in the modern squad game. So just try and remember that it’s all a bit of fun, yeah? A distraction from the bad things that happen.",
      "Among the biggest fudges we’ve made are those around injured players. On the one hand it felt daft to include, say, James Maddison even in a hypothetical Tottenham team. But at the same time it seemed silly to deny ourselves Noni Madueke in Arsenal’s back-up XI just because Bukayo Saka is out for a few weeks.",
      "The rough rule of thumb is that injured players expected to be back before 2026 are included; those not expected to be seen until next year are not.",
      "",
      "Marco Bizot; Andres Garcia, Pau Torres, Victor Lindelof, Ian Maatsen; Boubacar Kamara, Ross Barkley; Emi Buendia, Harvey Elliott, Donyell Malan; Evann Guessand",
      "Starts off well enough, but quickly disintegrates in front of your eyes. It’s a stark reminder of just how hard teams like Villa have it in trying to compete with the country’s elite in terms of squad depth and composition.",
      "And while we do think it’s past time they stopped whingeing about PSR and got on with it, it’s still easy enough to share or at least understand their frustration. The Thursday-Sunday workload for a team that have already made an alarmingly poor Premier League start could be killer looking at this lack of squad depth. We’ve had to include more injured players than would ideally have been the case as well, although that does at least mean we all avoid the indignity of Lindelof in midfield. Every cloud.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale; Emil Krafth, Malik Thiaw, Sven Botman, Lewis Hall; Jacob Ramsey, Joe Willock, Lewis Miley; Harvey Barnes, William Osula, Anthony Elanga",
      "It’s not the worst defence around, and by going with the back four Newcastle have predominantly used we do get to have Sven Botman as a high-class back-up because it’s impossible on this season’s current numbers to leave out either Dan Burn or Fabian Schar.",
      "The midfield looks a touch flimsy, and goals may well be the problem for this team. We also retain the right to change this team about a bit once we know how exactly Newcastle plan to deploy Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, but our current best guess is that both are in that first-choice XI, which does at least give this underpowered Newcastle team a couple of useful wide players.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens; Tyler Fredricson, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven; Diogo Dalot, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo, Tyrell Malacia; Mason Mount, Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee",
      "It’s not just the first XI being screwed up by Ruben Amorim’s absolute insistence on his precious back three. In the real world, of course, one imagines he’d sooner actually deploy Casemiro back there than go with two rookies flanking poor old Harry Maguire, but it only shifts the problem elsewhere with Lisandro Martinez out of contention for the foreseeable.",
      "Diogo Dalot being in the second XI feels like a quirk given he nearly always plays when available, but it does always feel like that’s because he’s actually first reserve in about six different positions rather than first choice anywhere.",
      "READ: Is this the team that takes Man Utd back into Europe? With or without Amorim…",
      "",
      "Filip Jorgensen; Malo Gusto, Wesley Fofana, Benoit Badiashile, Jorrel Hato; Romeo Lavia, Andrey Santos; Estevao, Facundo Buonanotte, Jamie Gittens; Liam Delap",
      "Can argue around the fringes of a few of these, especially Gittens v Garnacho, but it’s a solid enough team. As it ought to be for the BlueCo Player Trading Facility. It’s going to feel very odd when Liam Delap is fit again and Chelsea have two actual strikers to choose from.",
      "What does quickly become clear with a lot of these second XIs is that the defence is very often the primary cause of concern, and that’s definitely the case here. Doesn’t help when even your first-choice keeper is no confidence-inspirer, mind.",
      "",
      "Antonin Kinsky; Archie Gray, Kevin Danso, Ben Davies, Destiny Udogie; Lucas Bergvall, Yves Bissouma; Brennan Johnson, Wilson Odobert, Randal Kolo Muani; Dominic Solanke",
      "Spurs’ lack of defensive numbers are writ large here in a squad where Djed Spence has now surely usurped Destiny Udogie as first-choice left-back but also remains first understudy to Pedro Porro on the opposite flank. That means poor old Archie Gray gets shoehorned into this fictitious team just as he was shoehorned into so many actual Spurs teams last season.",
      "Ben Davies as a first reserve in big 2025 is a hilarious situation, and Spurs fans will just have to keep everything crossed that Frankball continues to place far less stress on Micky van de Ven’s twangy hamstrings than Angeball did.",
      "Further forward… it’s not too bad, although Xavi Simons’ status as the only real lock-picker in the long-term absence of both Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison leaves a front four where perspiration would appear to significantly outdo inspiration.",
      "We’ve had to go for a 4-2-3-1 here rather than Frank’s preferred 4-3-3 just on a numbers game; and even then we’ve had to include the apparently discarded Yves Bissouma, who was not named in Spurs’ Champions League squad.",
      "READ: Spurs stumble through ‘miracle’ Champions League return as Frank’s side powered by Arsenal boos",

      "Arne Slot attempting to solve his Trent Alexander-Arnold problem by playing Dominik Szoboszlai as his first-choice right-back gives us a strong start to this XI, with Liverpool having once again secured themselves A+ goalkeeping back-up after Caoimhin Kelleher’s years of top service.",
      "That hole left at centre-back by the failure to get Marc Guehi over the line really is a large one, though. Really does feel like Liverpool are one halfway serious injury away from a crisis in there.",
      "",
      "James Trafford; Matheus Nunes, Nathan Ake, Abdukodir Khusanov, Rico Lewis; Nico Gonzalez, Nico O’Reilly, Mateo Kovacic; Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Omar Marmoush",
      "It’s an XI that wouldn’t feel entirely absurd to see in action, and you can’t really ask for much more than that. Rico Lewis shuttled over to left-back is a bit of a positional fudge and there’s no denying it’s a midfield three that tends toward the dreary.",
      "If you want an XI with more creative oomph, then Oscar Bobb could come in for O’Reilly and turn it into more of a 4-2-3-1, we guess. But the front three is good fun regardless. So it balances out. Kind of.",

      "Come on, now. That’s just daft, isn’t it? That’s just… just a completely fine top-six Premier League starting XI. There is not one conspicuous point of weakness, no fudge where a player is shoehorned into a secondary role to fill a gap and do a job.",
      "Not one player you’d have any concerns about fulfilling the exact role they’re occupying here in any game.",
      "We’d be genuinely interested to see where this hypothetical team might finish for Arsenal across a whole Premier League season, and there really would only need to be the slightest distorting of reality to arrive at our preferred banter answer of second.",

      "It has been a bewildering decade or so for goalkeepers caught in a Pep-prompted identity crisis. But Guardiola may finally have brought some relief for keepers at all levels still confused as to who and what they really are.",
      "It was already brewing around 2016, but the public’s perception of goalkeepers really became skewed when Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad and immediately binned Joe Hart. At that point, Hart was still England no.1 and widely regarded as one of Europe’s top goalkeepers.",
      "A playmaker, though, he was not. So out he went for Claudio Bravo. The Chilean took the form of a hologram when his goal was being targeted, but he could spray passes for fun.",
      "Guardiola found the necessary balance at Benfica. From there he bought Ederson in 2017, since when coaches across the land have sought to imitate the City boss by turning their keepers into quarter-backs.",
      "It was entirely reasonable to demand more from goalkeepers in possession. But by that point, no No.1 had ever reached the top level without a solid grounding in the basics. Pep came a quarter of a century after the back-pass ban in 1992 which was genuinely seismic for goalkeepers in comparison to what the Guardiola movement demanded.",
      "Still, keepers have endured a disorienting time in recent years. At all levels, they have so often been judged more on their feet than their hands. Which ignores the primary purpose of a goalkeeper entirely.",
      "Maybe for many it was a matter of convenience. Judging a goalkeeper is very difficult – coaching one even more so – when you have no knowledge of the position. Why learn about the role when you can change it to something else closer to what you’re already familiar with?",
      "Mercifully, the man who prompted a million p*ss-poor imitations may be redressing the balance himself. For goalkeepers particularly, Guardiola’s signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma could be as influential as the slinging of Joe Hart.",
      "There should be some caution over reading too much into Donnarumma’s arrival since it was clearly an opportunistic move on City’s part. Even up to the first weekend of the season, Ederson was staying and he would compete with James Trafford. The chance to sign one of the world’s best goalkeepers was, evidently, too good to miss. Though not if you’re Manchester United.",
      "But it does give an insight into Guardiola’s instinct and the way he sees the game going.",
      "“He is so tall, he is so huge. From all the keepers, what we want is safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence.”",
      "In goalkeeping terms, those are almost old-school traits. But as necessary now as they ever were with so many teams at the top level opting to take a more direct route, with long throw-ins and set-pieces slung under the bar back in vogue.",
      "The Goalkeepers’ Union is yet to elect its first spokesperson – who would that be? – but reports from the ground suggest the feeling in the ranks is one of relief. Where Guardiola goes, others inevitably follow, so perhaps the obsession with goalkeepers being playmakers might diminish to a more reasonable balance.",
      "That’s a positive thing for everyone, right? Who among us wants to watch a formulaic, overly-prescriptive game where goalkeepers and centre-backs spend much, much more time on the ball than the attacking players? Supporters don’t show up for rondos in their own box while the flair players stand high and wide on the off-chance a centre-back can beat a rabid press. Do they?",
      "That absolutely isn’t to dismiss entirely the idea of building from the back. The principle is sound – especially if you are Guardiola with City’s players to put it into practise. But somewhere along the line, it became the only way to play.",
      "That saturation point, thankfully, seems to have passed. Managers at all levels, from the Premier League down through the EFL to the park, if not ditching the theory completely are choosing their moments far more wisely. Many are again embracing the direct route. To the point that the cycle perhaps might again take us on Route One to POMO football.",
      "We don’t want those methods across the board in the same way that building from the back should not be forced on absolutely everyone; football needs different styles, rather than being the homogeneous lump it threatened to become while everyone jumped aboard Pep’s bandwagon.",
      "From a goalkeeper’s perspective, there remains some way to go before the world has properly healed. After all, when Donnarumma became available in the summer, there was a queue of just one, rather than the clamour there ought to have been to land one of the greats in his prime. His wages, of course, were a factor, but too many still overlooked his shot-stopping genius because he’s not passing like Pirlo.",
      "Guardiola can see past that, so it should not be long before everyone else has their priorities straight too.",
      "Arsenal won away in the Champions League but are ‘completely predictable’, with that midfield trio inducing sleep.",
      "We have ranked the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ on their squad strength, using their ‘second XIs’. My word, Arsenal are good.",
      "Spurs are only in the Champions League thanks to a ‘miracle’ and Thomas Frank is not the only one who will have to get used to the standard quickly.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim will reportedly be sacked on one condition as Kobbie Mainoo’s situation at the club has baffled his Red Devils team-mates.",
      "The Red Devils had a fairly busy summer, bringing in five new players to help Amorim turn around his fortunes after his side finished 15th in the Premier League last term.",
      "Man Utd have not started much better with more inconsistent performances meaning they are currently 14th after one win, one loss and two defeats in their opening four fixtures.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo joined in deals totalling close to £200m as Man Utd look to avoid being one of the lowest scoring sides in the Premier League, like last season.",
      "However, many fans and former players reckon some of that money would have been better utilised to bring in a new midfielder before the deadline on September 1.",
      "Man Utd did attempt to bring in Carlos Baleba earlier in the window but a deal was never realistic for this summer with Brighton hoping to get a fee of around £115m for the Cameroon international.",
      "READ: Amorim sack inevitable but he has proved that replacing him at Man Utd might be impossible to fail",
      "Their need for a defensive midfielder was evident again on Sunday when they lost 3-0 to arch-rivals Man City with Amorim issuing a defiant message following suggestions he should change his style to suit the players at his disposal.",
      "Amorim said: “I won’t change my philosophy. If they [Manchester United board] want it changed, you change the man.",
      "“I am not going to change my philosophy. I will play my way until I want to change. I accept it is not a record you should have at Manchester United. But there are a lot of things that you have no idea about what happened in the last months.",
      "“I understand everything. [Criticism] is normal, but I don’t accept that we are not doing better. We are doing better and the results just don’t show that. The record says everything, I understand.",
      "“My message is I will do everything. I will give everything. It is not my decision, the rest. I will do my best. I am suffering more than [the fans].”",

      "Despite this, former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown, who ‘remains very well-connected within the game’, claims Maguire ‘could quit’ amid the ‘new twist’ relating to Amorim’s deployment of the centre-back.",

      "“That’s not what you should be asking of your centre-half. If Amorim feels he can make the difference, then you have to question why he’s not playing from the start.",

      "“When his contract comes to and end next year, he’ll be free to explore his options and perhaps move to a club who value him a bit more than he is at United.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed whether he’d rather have Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe with the Manchester City star “blitzing” teams like he did Manchester United.",
      "Haaland had his joint-best club performance of the season at the weekend. The City star scored a brace in a 3-0 victory over rivals United.",
      "It’s the second time this season that the Norwegian has bagged twice in a club game, first doing it on the opening day of the season against Wolves.",
      "Between those two games, one of the deadliest performances of Haaland’s career came, as he netted five goals and assisted twice in Norway’s 11-1 victory over Moldova in World Cup qualification.",
      "That was a few days prior to the United game, meaning Haaland has seven goals in his last two outings.",
      "Former United man Ferdinand praised the form of the Norwegian as he made a choice between him and Real Madrid superstar Mbappe.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “Sometimes you’ve got to hold your hands up. Erling Haaland has got 15 goals in his last 10 games. So it ain’t like this is an isolated situation against Man Utd.",
      "“15 in 10 for club and country. 50 home Premier League goals. It’s not a mess about.",
      "“So as much as I’m sitting there critiquing the Man Utd defenders, the geezer is blitzing teams week in, week out at home in the Premier League for Manchester City.",

      "In club football this season, Haaland has five goals in four games, following three goals and an assist in four Club World Cup matches.",
      "Mbappe, meanwhile, has four goals and one assist in four games so far this term, so the pair have very similar numbers for the season, though the Frenchman is coming off the back of a less effective Club World Cup, where he scored just once in three games.",
      "Haaland and Mbappe will come up against each other in the Champions League on December 10. In three matches against each other so far in their careers, Haaland is the better goalscorer, with four strikes to Mbappe’s one.",

      "It would be stupid of Unai Emery, Oliver Glasner or really anyone to inherit this mess at Man Utd. But Ruben Amorim has also made it even more appealing.",
      "Sorry for the molten hot take – you may wish to sit down for this, SPOILER ALERT etc. – but it does rather look like Manchester United might have to change their manager again some time quite soon.",
      "We absolutely count ourselves among the mugs who thought Ruben Amorim would be different. That this was a manager who arrived in Manchester with the requisite skills and charisma to actually have a chance.",
      "He charmed us early on, albeit that was mainly by behaving with impressive dignity when Ed Sheeran was being a prick on Sky and every single member of Sky’s starry-eyed pundit panel simperingly indulged it after a 1-1 draw at Portman Road. A result which, in hindsight, might actually have been the more significant event of the day.",
      "But he’s f**ked now, his insistence on sticking with his beloved 3-4-3 in the face of a squad wholly unsuited to its requirements having long since tipped over from stoic and principled into mulish stubborn stupidity.",
      "His attempts at goading Manchester United into sacking him are now free from any and all couching, with his response to another humbling result in which his system and the players attempting to play within it were ruthlessly exposed yet again being “I’m not changing, if you want literally anything other than more of this unwatchable and dreadful sh*t then sack me, yeah?” (We’re paraphrasing, but this was the gist.)",
      "Where were we? Oh yeah. Amorim. Back at the start. When we thought he was going to be good at this and, perhaps even more importantly, he thought he was going to be good at this.",
      "Point being, we get it. We get the lure and the pull of Manchester United. In hindsight, Amorim was a damn fool who has set his career back catastrophically by doing what he knew at the time to be a sub-optimal choice of jumping to United mid-season when he had a really, really good thing going on at Sporting.",
      "But you really do always have to remember this was and is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. It’s easy to forget now he’s been reduced to a meme for p*ssing about with his little magnet toys while his team were 2-0 down at League Two Grimsby, but back when United appointed him there was perhaps no more highly-rated and better regarded young coach in the game. Xabi Alonso, maybe, but that’s about it.",
      "Amorim was doing wonders at Sporting and whatever path he chose next seemed absolutely certain to involve one of the biggest clubs in the world. It was almost impossible to conceive a scenario where he wouldn’t be making that step up to the truly elite level with his next move.",
      "And yet even he, when the chance to take over at Manchester United came along at entirely the wrong time didn’t think he could risk turning that opportunity down in case it never came around again.",
      "So you really do have to consider that, when wondering whether managers of less overtly ridiculous Premier League clubs would accept the poisoned Old Trafford chalice if offered it. Because in almost all cases, we really think they would.",
      "The current top 10 favourites with the bookies to be next United manager contains four current Premier League managers. All of them have done and are doing excellent jobs at their current clubs, and all of those clubs are less screwed up than United are.",
      "But still we think any one of Oliver Glasner, or Unai Emery, or Marco Silva, or Andoni Iraola would take this stupid opportunity if it were offered them.",
      "TIMUFCWTA is such a powerful thing, still. To be absolutely clear, we’re not saying any or all of those managers should leave their current jobs for United. With the possible exception of Emery, who may well be sensing the way the Villa Park winds are blowing and consider now to be a good time to get out with his reputation still sky high, it would almost certainly be foolish.",
      "But we still think they’d do it, and can still see why they would do it even if they shouldn’t. Being the manager who sorts Manchester United out is a beguiling thought, and even the most publicly self-effacing manager wouldn’t have got to the level of ‘Successful Premier League Gaffer’ without a large enough slice of ego to truly believe they could be the manager to do just that.",
      "Will it work for them? No, it never does. These people delude themselves into thinking it might but… but it might work for Glasner/Emery/Silva/Iraola.",
      "Hear us out. Are Manchester United a sensible and stable football club for a manager to be getting involved in right now? No, obviously not. Logically you should run for the hills at the first whispers in the press suggesting you’re in the running.",
      "But you have to accept and acknowledge the temptation. We’ve already seen it this summer with players. The power of TIMUFCWTA led Bryan Mbeumo to ignore glances from actual Champions League clubs – one of them now managed by the man under which he reached the elite levels necessary to attract their interest – because he only wanted United.",
      "He’s not an outlier. And nor would any of those managers be who think they could do what Amorim couldn’t, what Ten Hag couldn’t, what Mourinho, Solskjaer, Van Gaal and Moyes couldn’t.",
      "And a big part of the reason why that is somehow a less mad thing to believe of yourself is specifically because of not despite just how bad Amorim has been.",

      "There’s a very real danger – in life in general as well as football specifically – in believing rock bottom has been struck, that things cannot possibly get any worse.",
      "Fair to say we probably all thought United had reached that point under Ten Hag – at least in the league.",
      "Amorim has exploded that notion entirely. Yet now that bar is so low that literally the only way for a new manager to fall below it would be literal, actual relegation. Amorim has so spectacularly scorched the earth that the impossible job might now in fact have become one in which it really is impossible to fail.",
      "United is a mess of a club, without doubt, and the squad is an incoherent hotch-potch of players assembled without an apparent clear plan for how to assemble them into a team. But they shouldn’t be this bad. They shouldn’t be 31-points-from-31-games-and-no-idea-how-to-score-goals bad.",
      "There is still heaps of talent in this squad, and some of it hasn’t been forced out by Amorim yet. There is still time.",
      "So bad has Amorim’s system become that there are quick fixes everywhere. Just changing to a system – literally any system – where Bruno Fernandes can operate as a creative No. 10 instead of a frustrated central-midfield workhorse would surely deliver some kind of instant result.",
      "Having a gameplan where the primary creative outlet is Bruno, or Matheus Cunha, or Mbeumo rather than Patrick Dorgu is surely going to make things a bit less bad. Or a system that doesn’t fundamentally require two mobile, technical runners in midfield when you have no mobile technical midfield runners available.",
      "A defence that doesn’t disapparate instantly at the sight of more than two opposition attackers. This kind of thing.",
      "None of these feel like they should be impossible puzzles to solve. The problem for United currently isn’t that Amorim can’t find solutions to these issues, it’s that he’s too pig-headed to even accept the premise that solutions can or should be sought.",
      "It’s still plenty early enough in the season for any of those other managers to make meaningful changes even with the existing playing personnel at what would in all likelihood be the biggest club any of them would ever get to manage.",
      "It should still be easy enough for a manager with a smidgeon of flexibility and imagination to steer this club into the top eight this season.",

      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Arsenal won away in the Champions League but are ‘completely predictable’, with that midfield trio inducing sleep.",
      "We have ranked the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ on their squad strength, using their ‘second XIs’. My word, Arsenal are good.",
      "Pep Guardiola sparked an identity crisis among shotstoppers but the signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma could serve as an olive branch to the Goalkeepers’ Union…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘found a replacement’ for head coach Ruben Amorim and there are three reasons behind their verdict.",
      "Spurs are only in the Champions League thanks to a ‘miracle’ and Thomas Frank is not the only one who will have to get used to the standard quickly."

      "",
      "There has been a lot of chatter about Amorim’s system and whether it can work in the PL. Whilst xG has little tangible value, the fact we sit second in terms of xG does at least show the system works in terms of creating high-quality chances. Tons of frustration and, ultimately, pressure coming from the fact we can’t seem to finish those chances yet but they are there.",
      "Defensively, we have conceded too many. Some of that is down to the attack not taking pressure off the defence – it’s easier to defend a 2 or 3 nil lead than a 1 goal lead. However, looking at the goals we have conceded this is generally not a systemic issue.",
      "– 1 against Arsenal was a foul or GK error depending on your POV (definite foul). We outplayed Arsenal and should have won the game.",
      "– 1 against Fulham, not closing down the cross and poor marking in the middle. Should have been out of sight by HT, including a missed penalty.",
      "– 2 against Burnley, first was just like Fulham goal and cross should have been shut down, second was long throw, pinball and weak GK. Had enough chances to score 427 goals first half.",
      "– City game, lazy defending by Shaw, Yoro wrong side of man for second, Shaw and Maguire poor on ball for third. Well in the game in the first half, missed two 4 yard tap-ins second half and Donnarumma save from Mbeumo. Ended on similar xG but they were clinical in attack and defence.",
      "So a litany of bad luck, bad finishing, bad defending and valid excuses, but the main thing that counts is the scoreline and points. Naturally, he has to start winning football matches or it’s all for nothing. But focusing on the system is a red herring – even the extra man in MF can be mitigated by players on the pitch (times when a WB comes inside, one of the 10s drops deeper, one of the CBs steps in etc – players need to be better at figuring stuff out on the hop).",

      "1) Ownership with a backbone\nI 100% believe that I am seeing something from the new ownership group that we’ve needed since Sir Alex retired; conviction. You can feel free to listen to Luke Shaw or Gary Neville or other fans who have varying opinions on the situation; what you are seeing cannot be easily fixed with a change of manager and formation; we’ve seen this script play out 5 times now; we’ll hang around 3-6th place for a season or two and the whole thing will implode again.",
      "I am bored of the cycle, we need to hurt at this moment in time. This is a sporting institution that has been mishandled for far too long; having an owner who will take their licks in service to a larger vision is important at this moment. They have their lofty target of our first Premier League by 2028 and I’m willing to see how that will play out. They achieve it, lauded as geniuses and if they fail, the level of anger remains the same.",
      "2) 31 points in 31 games\nWhat is the metric we are holding this up to? I won’t be the “win it all” United of 2009 and we certainly can’t be holding it up to the shit show that was November – May of last season. Contextually, it was horrendous up down, left and right and this is our manager’s first summer to clear out the squad; which he has for the most part and we know that we’ll be clearing a glut of players next summer too.",
      "The replacements have been significantly better than what was there before and so a bedding in period should be expected. Do I think we’ll get relegated? No, seen enough so far to say we are a mid table team that can beat other mid-lower table teams and get a couple of results from those above us.",
      "The way I see the current situation, Amorim is part of the chemotherapy regimen to ‘heal’ United’s cancer (sorry for the crude metaphor, have lost a loved one to it and for others who have to, you catch my drift). The decisions he makes on the field can offer us temporary relief, but it doesn’t guarantee that we’re in remission. What will the signs be that we’re on the right track? Lord, if I knew, I’d be a very rich man.",
      "3) Discomfort in the unknown\nWe live in a society that demands answers without even understanding what questions we should be asking. We, as fans, have been left scrambling looking for solutions so that we can be seen as the reasonable voice in the crowd. Here is my summary as the most reasonableness person in this fanbase; it’s a bit shit at the moment isn’t it? Not being able to will our club into greatness again.",
      "I will always love United; you’ll never be able to take those memories away from me and I’m so happy we live in an age where we can go back and rewatch those moments. But I’m also someone who knows that what it will take to get United back to the top cannot be written out in a one pager.

      "“They’ve got to bite the bullet and say this is not going to work.",
      "“There’s no progression, there’s no improvement. The only improvement you could potentially say is they’ve signed some decent players, in Bryan Mbeumo, in [Matheus] Cunha.”",
      "Indeed, O’Hara feels there’s been no standout performances which show United can turn things around.",

      "“They were absolutely terrible against Grimsby, shocking performance, shocking against Man [City] and they were bang average against Burnley. They needed a lot minute mistake fro a Burnley player to go and win the game.",

      "“They don’t get the system, they cannot make it work, and Ruben Amorim is so arrogant and so stuck in his ways of ‘this is how I’m going to play.’ You’re basically telling the team every single week this is how Man United are going to set up, this is the performance they’re going to put in and let’s work on that and go and beat them.”",
      "O’Hara also feels that Bruno Fernandes is having the creativity sucked out of him by being played in the wrong role.",
      "“They get over in midfield every single week. They’ve got one of the best creative midfielders in the world in Bruno Fernandes, they’re trying to play him as a No.6, he’s not a No.6, he’s a No.10, he’s an attacking midfielder.",

      "“There will be a decision to make on Manuel Ugarte. I can reveal to you that of Manuel Ugarte, there was a possibility of exit this summer, because, for example, Italian clubs were interested in Ugarte, but Manchester United decided to close doors to an eventual loan move. So this is why nothing happened for Manuel Ugarte.",

      "“I did both roles. As a No.10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It’s a totally different mindset.”",

      "Unfortunately, what wasn’t in the script was them just continuing to win games whilst playing this way.",
      "They were meant to be dropping points, allowing other teams to put pressure on them in the title race. But they reckoned without the elite winning mentality in the dressing room, the one that runs right through the team, one that refuses to accept anything apart from winning games.",

      "It’s clear that a lot of the reaction to Liverpool this season has been based on mailboxers watching highlights and/or alerts on social media. Had they watched the full 90s (admittedly a slog for the Arsenal game) they would have seen a team that was so deliberate and varied in its attack that they earned their wins through elite management and attacking talent plus sheer graft.",
      "Liverpool were cruising 2-0 against Bournemouth when, while going for a third, they carelessly gave the ball away twice and conceded two excellent breakaway goals. Slot managed the situation and his substitute (Chiesa) scored what was effectively the winner.",
      "It was a similar story against Newcastle. Of course the timing of the goal, the age of the goalscorer and the context of the Isak transfer raised the stakes but once again, Slot managed the situation and it paid off as he had hoped.",
      "The Arsenal game was a battle for tactical supremacy and therefore a largely dull affair. However, at half time Slot instructed his team to increase the intensity of passing and make more direct runs. It almost paid off twice, with one attempt being ruled out for offside while the other led to a free kick which won the game. Even that wasn’t dumb luck as Szoboszlai has a decent record of scoring freekicks.",
      "Liverpool dominated Burnley by every measure. So much so that Van Dijk and Konate’s average position was probably in the attacking half(!) But yet again, Slot managed his personnel and tactics and so eventually, 100 minutes of attacking pressure forced an error, resulting in a pressure penalty which still look some Egyptian minerals to put away.",
      "Is there room for improvement? Yes. Have the matches been a breathtaking spectacle? No. However, Liverpool have not been lucky either. The manager has managed the situations and when called upon, the players have made some stunning contributions. That’s keeping in mind they’ve played 3 of last season’s best teams as well has a promoted team that hadn’t lost at home for a whole season (in the Champo, obviously).",
      "Is it sustainable? Well, possibly yes because I doubt Slot will forget his tactical nous and it’s unlikely Liverpool’s vast array of attackers will all have stinkers all at the same time for most of the season.",
      "It won’t guarantee Liverpool will win the league though. Arsenal have their best squad for 20 years and Man City have a genius coach. If Liverpool carry on as they are, they will challenge. But if they can improve then they’ll be strong favourites to take the crown again.\nNilesh, Harrow",

Well I’m here to tell you that this just isn’t the case, outside of Ferguson and say Matt Busby, United have always been an average club/team that got lucky with one man.",
      "Man United is a huge club with many supporters across the globe, often being touted as THE biggest club in world football and an inherently successful club for the whole time it’s been around – but a closer examination of the club’s history reveals something different, Manchester United’s golden era of dominance is almost entirely attributable to one man, Alex Ferguson.",
      "Outside his reign (and a good few years under Matt Busby) the club has struggled to maintain consistent success, which means United are not this inherently successful club we’ve been led to believe and never have been.",
      "Before Ferguson’s appointment in 1986, Manchester United’s trophy cabinet was hardly bulging. In 109 years from when they were founded in 1878 to when Ferguson was given the job in 1986, United won the league title just seven times, a decent amount of titles but hardly dominant. For most of its life it was overshadowed by more successful clubs like Liverpool. They had a modicum of success under Matt Busby who won 5 of their 7 league titles and one European cup.",
      "As an aside my grandad who was a scouser and staunch Liverpool fan would always say they were the greatest side he’d ever seen even after watching the Liverpool sides of the 70’s and 80’s.

      "It was under Alex Ferguson that Manchester United became the powerhouse that we all know today. Between 1986 and 2013, United won 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 Champions Leagues. Ferguson built and rebuilt squads and created a culture of excellence. He wasn’t just the manager of Man United, he was Man United.",
      "Since his retirement in 2013, Manchester United have failed spectacularly to replicate Ferguson’s success. Despite having seasoned high-profile managers like José Mourinho, Louis van Gaal etc… and spending billions in some of the so called best players in the world, the club has failed get the results it thinks it deserves. They’ve won the odd trinket here and there but never coming close to the big fellas like the league and Champions League.",
      "This post-Ferguson decline exposes the truth that Manchester United is not inherently successful. It was Ferguson who instilled a winning mentality, developed world-class players, and created a dynasty. Without him, the club has been unable to stand on its own two feet.",

      "The current squad is a mixture of very good, pretty average, past their sell by dates, young and inexperienced, and frankly ridiculously over rated players. All if this due to a succession of terrible manager appointments and even worse transfer dealings. If Liverpool did indeed consider Amorim as a replacement for Klopp and as is believed, walked away having held discussions over playing style, what numpty’s at United didn’t hold the same conversation? Whilst City will spend £50mil on a player and twelve months later another £60mil on an upgrade, United have spent millions on the wrong player and even more on another in the same position who is no better than what they have or is yet another fingers crossed signing.",
      "Is there a funnier sight than watching a Premier League record signing once again be caught out of position and desperately looking like he’s running through mud to try and recover whilst failing again, add to that an unfit full back, who everyone knows is unfit, also labouring.\nRecord after record is being set as the worst ever start is now replaced by a new worst ever start. And yet the mailbox is still populated with people saying “we can finish top 4 with some good signings in January”, I saw youtube video of a fan saying that Sesko was excellent and De Ligt was excellent in a game City won without breaking sweat. Do these fans really believe that ‘cos if they do, they are part of the problem.",
      "With the possible exception of Mbeumo, United don’t have a single player who would be a starter in any of the top 6 sides from last season (well maybe Villa) a damning indictment on their transfer dealings and yet the fans still believe (admirable but delusional), and still find excuses.",
      "United’s problems lie in every aspect, the owners, the management, the playing staff and the fan base, until at least one recognises it’s part in this shitshow, nothing will change.",
      "And whilst I will get some flak I would point Utd fans to The Spirit of Shankly, a body which ultimately forced our despised owners and their totally inadequate manager and his totally inadequate players out of the club, it still took a while to get the club back to where it had been but it has been done.

      "After buying his stake in Manchester United 18 months ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted he and his INEOS team had “made a lot of cock-ups” in his other footballing ventures, Lausanne and Nice, presumably in a bid to convince the Red Devils fans that they had learned lessons from those mistakes that would not be repeated at Old Trafford.",
      "“Huge change” off the pitch certainly hasn’t been for the better on it. Ruben Amorim is the latest Manchester United manager ‘losing the dressing room’, differing from predecessor Erik ten Hag only in sticking to a (failing) philosophy rather than not having one and seemingly wanting to be sacked rather than preferring to keep the most ill-fated job in football.",
      "Ratcliffe’s made questionable strategic calls and ill-advised comments in interviews that are among the mistakes we’ve listed here, including some that the Ratcliffe advocates will claim weren’t his decisions, but – despite his clear ethos of passing it wherever possible – the buck stops with him.",
      "Anyway, strap yourselves in: Ratcliffe’s mistakes ranked from minor to major.",
      "",
      "It doesn’t seem all that unreasonable for a struggling organisation not to hand out £100 Christmas bonuses and instead give members of staff a £40 M&S voucher, and the employees themselves may well have been fine had it been explained to them properly and hadn’t been part of a widespread cost-cutting scheme that’s seen many of their friends and colleagues made redundant while what we assume is now half-ply loo paper is on hand the toilets.",
      "“At least the Glazers prioritised families,” said one staffer. “And anuses,” said another, probably.",
      "",
      "We suspect the Manchester United fans were delighted to hear about Ratcliffe and Ineos’ plan to conduct a ‘thorough strategic review’ of the football club when the British billionaire took charge of all football operations. After years of Glazer family negligence, on and off the pitch, it was necessary.",
      "But while we imagined people in hard hats pointing to leaks in the Old Trafford roof and football coaching svengali Jason Wilcox shaking his head on the side-lines of an Erik ten Hag training session, we didn’t foresee Big Sir Jim himself picking up dirty socks from the academy dressing room.",
      "It’s a level of scrutiny that in some ways reflects well on the fourth-richest man in Britain – he has a hands-on approach – but upon describing the cleanliness of the youth team changing rooms as a ‘disgrace’, along with many of the other facilities on his tour of the club in a leaked whole staff email, Ratcliffe immediately managed to ‘create a toxic feeling inside Carrington’.",
      "He labelled the Manchester United museum – quite possibly the pride and joy of several members of staff – a load of ‘crap’, and in a bid to end the work-from-home culture, told employees to head back to the offices, despite there not being enough desks for them all to work from. ‘If you don’t like it, please seek alternative employment,’ he told them.",
      "Your Simon Jordans claimed it was a necessary shake-up, a method of sorting the wheat from the chaff, but there’s also little doubt that some very capable employees – not necessarily all Gen Z woke snowflakes – won’t have enjoyed Ratcliffe’s authoritarian day-one approach, will have taken it as a bleak sign of what was to come and taken a job in a more forward-thinking environment.",
      "",
      "Ratcliffe’s claim that a “conversation” with the government was required after proposing that Old Trafford is redeveloped into the ‘Wembley of the North’ was galling, to put it mildly.",
      "The suggestion was that the burden of financing United’s next chapter should be shared between him, a man worth around £12bn, and the taxpayers. A brazen proposal even before you consider that Ratcliffe himself is a tax exile having officially changed his residence in 2020 from Hampshire to Monaco in a move estimated to have saved him £4bn, which is enough to build two Wembleys of wherever.",
      "",
      "We all know the guy – it’s always a guy – who suddenly appears one day, is overly friendly in a bid to gain confidences, laughing and joking one second and comically stern the next to keep everyone on their toes. Can be seen staring at walls and slowly stirring tea before snapping out of what we assume is a daydream about making a suit of human skins to ask if you’d like a cup. Yeahhh y’know, that guy.",
      "Ratcliffe’s ‘spy’ is said to be one of the Ineos chiefs taking roles and ‘assuming greater importance’ at the club, deepening what several sources described as a “growing culture of fear”, with staff members tiptoeing around this particular individual for fear of the sack, ‘being extra vigilant about what they say in his presence’.",
      "",
      "In order to give Manchester United the best chance of on-field success, no saving is off-limits in the Ratcliffe regime, as those travelling to the FA Cup final discovered.",
      "As joyous as that day became, any staff attending did so without recourse to former privileges. They each paid £20 towards travel costs that previously came as a perk of the job, while packed lunches were also seen as a luxury they could do without by the penny-pinchers at a club that saved a whopping £6,500 on the day before revealing record revenues of £660m shortly after the Wembley win.",
      "Top lad Bruno Fernandes offered to pay for the staff travel but the Ineos chiefs rejected that proposal because they thought ‘it would reflect badly on the regime’, and apparently didn’t think anyone would have an issue with ‘thousands being shelled out on chauffeured cars’ to take them to the very same event.",
      "",
      "Not nearer the top because they only ‘considered it’ but even thinking about cutting the disabled supporters’ association budget in half is deplorable.",
      "As David Ornsein said, it’s “terrible optics” for a football club that has routinely spunked tens of millions of pounds on average footballers to believe that a viable and reasonable method of cutting costs is to make the lives of their disabled supporters harder. The audacity would almost be impressive if it wasn’t so shameful.",
      "",
      "It would be unreasonable for Ratcliffe to know the name of all, or even most, Manchester United employees. There are a lot of them; far too many in his opinion. But we reckon the captain of the football club should have been in the top ten names learned by Ratcliffe before he rocked up.",
      "We would have thought Katie Zelem wearing a training kit and boots might have been a bit of a giveaway as Ratcliffe doddered towards her like a 99-year-old royal and asked: “And what do you do, little lady?” Disappointed that the competition winner hadn’t curtsied as he approached.",
      "",
      "One good decision Ratcliffe has made was to end the club’s financial commitment to Sir Alex Ferguson. Cutting the jobs of 250 Normal People while continuing to pay £2m to a manager who retired over a decade ago would have been laughable, legend or not.",
      "But the co-owner can consider himself very fortunate that Ferguson still has his ear to the Old Trafford ground having reportedly advised him against an extraordinary move that would have been a PR disaster of epic proportions and speaks to Ratcliffe’s lack of knowledge of what’s important to the football club.",
      "Anyone asked about landmark events in the history of Manchester United would talk extensively about the Busby Babes, who came through the youth ranks and were touted to dominate European football before the Munich air disaster. Their story is woven into the fabric of the football club.",
      "What you don’t want to be doing as the new figurehead of Manchester United is dishonouring those young men or anyone associated with them in any way whatsoever, which makes his supposed plan to ‘revoke the privileges given to the families of the Busby Babes at United’ a truly incredible one.",
      "‘The families of players involved in Sir Matt Busby’s legendary side are regulars in the directors’ box at Old Trafford, but the club’s part-owners had threatened to put an end to those positions’ the report claims, with Ratcliffe’s view presumably that those seats could instead be given to very rich people from faceless companies who may throw a few million his way. Find another way, you berk.",
      "",
      "We don’t think we’ve ever heard of a club increasing ticket prices during a season; as MUST said, the idea that the fans must pay their ‘fair share’ for the club’s excesses and/or mismanagement — and above all, the Glazers lack of investment over two decades — is offensive.",
      "And we would suggest that a parent wanting to take their child to a game and having to shell out £132 for the privilege almost certainly doesn’t give a sh*t about the need to improve ‘operational efficiencies’ and ‘stabilise revenues’. They want to watch good football (alright, baby steps) for less than the cost of their monthly council tax.",
      "In response to the backlash, Ratcliffe said Manchester United are “mediocre” (no arguments here) when “it’s supposed to be one of the best football club’s in the world”. And in every interview he gives he talks about this gap between what they once were and what they are, in a We’re All In This Together sort of way, as if he’s suggesting every United fan should be direct debiting part of their salary to fix problems they have nothing to do with.",
      "The money the fans have already given has been wasted for years, and you want them to pay more to watch arguably the worst collection of footballers in Premier League history? Jog on, mate. An ‘outright rebellion’ is in the post.",
      "",
      "Before Ratcliffe arrived, even under the ownership of those horrible Glazers, Manchester United is said to have felt like a family club despite its global reach. Kath Phipps had a helluva lot to do with that.",
      "She first joined the club as the switchboard operator in September 1968, and was seemingly beloved by anyone who came into contact with her, acting as a bridge that crossed multiple eras.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and Jonny Evans were among her famous, frequent visitors in her last months in care, with her friends at the club, including several who had been ousted in the cuts, running a daily rota via WhatsApp to ensure she was never alone until her passing, two days after which her next of kin got a phone call from the club.",
      "A message of condolence presumably, maybe from Ratcliffe himself, letting the bereaved individual know that everyone at the club is thinking of them. That should probably be the minimum when the longest-serving employee of the football club you own dies.",
      "But no, what they received was a call from the football club that had been Kath’s life to enquire about the status of her two season tickets. Scarcely believable evidence of the ‘heart and soul’ of the football club eroding under Ratcliffe.",
      "It being the dearly departed Kath Phipps makes it worse, of course it does, but to think that it would also happening to other Manchester United fans is also really, really horrible.",
      "And if you’re one of the many, many United fans currently shouting It’s Not Sir Jim That’s Making The Phone Calls, you’re absolutely right, but while it’s also probably not Ratcliffe forcing the poor member of staff to take on this abhorrent task, it’s he who has created an environment where money needs to be saved at all costs, including the feelings of the very recently bereaved and the once-highly respected reputation of the football club.",
      "",
      "The optics aren’t great when only a few months after staff members were all told they were crucial in helping contribute to on-field success, 250 of them were made redundant as part of Ratcliffe’s determination to slash costs by scrapping ‘non-essential’ activities.",
      "Nearly a quarter of United’s employees lost their jobs and many of them, understandably, may well have pointed out that poor first-team recruitment has wasted far more money than will have been saved by cutting the rank-and-file workforce.",
      "And those redundancies were made before the club spent £200m in the summer of 2024 on further under-performing footballers, and another £200m this summer on players we can only assume will be similarly underwhelming.",
      "Each of the 250 employees would have to be earning £55,000 per year to make getting rid of them more cost effective than paying Matthijs de Ligt his salary, and that’s without considering the centre-back’s transfer fee, which would have been enough to keep those staff members in their jobs on that wage for three years.",
      "",
      "At the end of June, four months after his purchase of 27% of Manchester United (yes, Manchester United as a whole), Ratcliffe was asked whether he had considered spinning off the women’s team, with Chelsea having recently announced that their side will become a standalone entity.",
      "“We haven’t got into that level of detail with the women’s team yet. We’ve been pretty much focused on how we resolve the first team issues.”",
      "We understand why the men’s team is the priority. It’s the cash cow and what him and his team will ultimately be judged upon. But word to the wise Jim, don’t call them ‘the first team’. The women aren’t reserves just because they’re not men.",
      "A slip of the tongue, maybe, but a telling one which when added to him moving the women out of their training facility and into portable buildings to make room for the men, hardly paints Ratcliffe as a beacon of equality.",
      "Asked in the same interview about what they are doing with the women’s team, Ratcliffe replied: “Well they’ve just won the FA Cup” as if he a) cared having not even watched the game, and b) had anything whatsoever to do with that success.",
      "And imagine if he had given the same answer about the men when – as he well knows – the 2024 FA Cup win deflected from a poor league season and much deeper problems. He did not seem to have the same grasp of the issues with the women’s team, who finished 20 points behind champions Chelsea in the WSL that season.",
      "",
      "Instead of sacking Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 (more on that to come) they got rid of his two assistant coaches, Steve McClaren and Mitchell van der Gaag, replacing them with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy, who are arguably the two guys to have been most screwed by Ratcliffe and INEOS’ bungling.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought his own coaches because it would be mad to leave behind the people who have played a significant role in his success at Sporting, meaning Ruud moved to Leicester to destroy his reputation and Rene et al. were out on their ears after three months at Old Trafford.",
      "A lucky escape some would argue and they’ve been well-compensated, as were Sporting for United nicking their manager and coaching staff, which all-in-all left United too close to the PSR line to do anything of significant in January to help Amorim.",
      "",
      "Going for Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez or any other clear No.1 goalkeeper is weird, but it can at least be explained away with a view to not paying exorbitant wages and with an eye on the future. But there is no reasonable explanation for spending well over £200m and failing to fix the biggest problem in the team.",
      "No-one at that football club can believe that Manuel Ugarte is good enough, that Bruno Fernandes can play as one of the two in midfield or that Casemiro still has it in him. They also know, without doubt, that Amorim isn’t going to change his system. So why the p*ssing hell did they not buy Carlos Baleba or an alternative midfield machine?",
      "They are quite clearly f***ed and will continue to get f***ed without one. And we know Ratcliffe probably isn’t involved in transfer strategy, but a huge fan as he purports to be, with the chequebook in hand, should be insisting on a midfielder as the priority. Don’t have another £100m? Fine. Don’t use all of your cash on three forwards. Absolute madness.",
      "",
      "It now looks as though Ratcliffe has missed the resignation boat as Amorim has now dug his philosophical heels into the Old Trafford turf, insisting after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City that “If they [United hierarchy] want it [the philosophy] changed, you change the man.”",
      "But he had at least one opportunity to get rid of Amorim without the need for compensation, instead opting to talk Amorim down from the ledge following the 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January when he was ‘prepared to resign’, and reports after the embarrassing defeat to Grimsby Town claimed there was once again a ‘feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up’.",
      "It suggests little more than a nudge in that direction may have been required to bring his doomed tenure to an end.",
      "",
      "It was very, very funny, and embarrassing to the point where Ratcliffe must have considered ploughing on with a guy he clearly had no time or respect for as sporting director purely to avoid the humiliation.",
      "They spent no little time and money to haul him out of Newcastle, only to mutually consent him out the door after just five months in which the club spent £180m on players who have made next to no difference to their fortunes and hired a new manager who’s now as doomed as the one they got rid of.",
      "Amorim’s appointment was supposedly the big disagreement between Ashworth, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United brains trust, with Ashworth wanting either an English coach (Gareth Southgate specifically), Thomas Frank or for Ruud van Nistelrooy to stay in interim charge until the end of the season. He knew his stuff, eh?",
      "‘Who would you appoint if we sacked Erik ten Hag now?’ should have been the very first question in Ashworth’s interview.",
      "",
      "Handing someone who had just overseen the worst season in the club’s history a contract extension is one of the worst decisions made by anyone ever. They played well once, in the FA Cup final, having embarrassed themselves in the semi-final against Coventry, the entire Champions League campaign and the vast majority of their league fixtures. Manchester United were awful.",
      "Their excuse for not replacing Ten Hag being the lack of suitable alternatives was quickly exposed as nonsense given the manager they’ve now hired was so available in the summer that he flew to London to meet West Ham on the eve of his side’s crunch clash with Porto in their title run-in.",
      "",
      "We were told that Jason Wilcox, brought in as the new technical director, would be the man to ‘determine and drive the move to a clear “game model” – effectively a cohesive playing style and identity United intend to replicate across all age groups.’",
      "And apparently, unbelievably, after ‘providing a detailed assessment of Ten Hag’s strengths and weaknesses’ as the first duty in his new post, Wilcox reported back that not only was Ten Hag the right man for the job, he was also so good at his job that the club should continue to sign players to fit his system rather than individuals with a broader ethos in mind.",
      "Wilcox and the other directors may claim it’s a happy coincidence that the style of their former first-team coach was also the new Manchester United Way, though wouldn’t be at all surprised if the new Manchester United Way is actually more in line with Amorim’s ethos, which has required a host of his players rather than the bunch bought for Ten Hag that clearly aren’t fit for purpose as the perpetual cycle of Red Devils managers being five to six signings away from challenging for the title continues.",
      "",
      "Ashworth ‘warned’ them and they didn’t listen. He correctly foresaw that there would be ‘mass disruption’ if Amorim and his very specific ideas and playing style arrived mid-season. He must be p*ssing himself as that disruption continues unabated into the Portuguese manager’s first full season at Old Trafford.",
      "Ashworth wanted to ‘minimise upheaval’ after the squad had already had to adjust to a new backroom team under Ten Hag before being told to forget all that and to get used to a system most of them had never played before, with no time for adaptation with games coming thick and fast.",
      "Liverpool had considered Amorim but went for Slot as the Portuguese manager’s ‘three at the back and general philosophy jarred with the squad’. United made no such consideration having cared only about Amorim’s impressive ‘aura’. Boy are they regretting that now.",
      "Ratcliffe wanted United to be ‘chest out and bold’ and was ‘desperate for charisma’. Little did he know that that’s apparently all Amorim has.",
      "He told the club that he wanted to wait and join in the summer, but Omar Berrada told him it was ‘now or never’. If offered the chance to choose again, it would definitely be never.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",
      "Even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s “world-class” dream team at Manchester United are making mistakes as their “very poor” recruitment continues…",
      "According to reports, Sir Jim Ratcliffe prevented Manchester United from making a ‘proposal’ for a shock re-signing in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Manchester United are back. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ‘masterminded’ a big spend, ‘rebuilt’ everything and even won the Alejandro Garnacho transfer situation.",
      "Manchester United have put forward plans for their new stadium which they aim to open in 2030.",
      "Man Utd are not budging on their valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer even if it means moving on to different targets, according to reports."

      "Manchester United are rotten. Historically wretched. And the most frustrating aspect of it all is that it does not have to be this way.",
      "But are they telling a story of a team which has found its level, or one of long-term underperformance?",
      "Sure, there are some players promoted above their level by poor judgement or the refusal to source a better alternative. But the sum of United’s parts has to be better than this.",
      "That’s on Amorim. The squad should shoulder their substantial portion of the blame since it is they who are consistently failing in the moments. City showed them on Sunday the levels required at key times in both boxes and the contrast was woefully stark.",
      "But the manager is responsible for the shape his players take. And for as long as Amorim is in charge, we know that United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "That is his Thing. Amorim is the most dogmatic coach in the Premier League and, evidently, he would sacrifice his job before his tactical principles.",
      "Brave? Absolutely. Stupid? Draw your own conclusions.",
      "At this stage, it is beginning to look like an act of self-sabotage. In fairness to Amorim, his steadfast refusal to consider another way cannot come as a surprise to United or anyone else. They knew what they were getting when they hired him from Sporting Lisbon. But everyone else now knows what they are facing when they go up against United. Which would be fine if the system worked.",
      "But it plainly doesn’t. You can pin that on a number of factors. Among them: players who can’t or won’t adapt; ropey recruitment; the hopeless predictability of it all.",
      "Amorim’s primary function as manager of Manchester United is to get the best out of the group of players at his disposal. Which his beloved system does not. And the chances of that changing in a timely fashion are slimmer than the fit on his chinos.",
      "If Amorim won’t consider the possibility that there might be a better way, one which plays to his squad’s strengths, then it ought to be a quick and easy win for his replacement.",
      "In United’s current predicament, they could be forgiven – encouraged, actually – for going back to basics with a system their players know and understand.",
      "Would the United squad be more comfortable in a 4-2-3-1? Almost certainly. Which highlights the ridiculousness of Amorim not opening his mind even slightly.",
      "Firstly, it puts his best player, Bruno Fernandes, in his best position, the no.10 role. Not shunted towards the flank as one of the two wider players off a frontman, or shoehorned in as one of the double pivot. With Matheus Cunha one side of him, Bryan Mbuemo the other, maybe United’s centre-forward, currently Benjamin Sesko, would not be set up to fail.",
      "At the back, there is comfort in familiarity. United’s players are showing no sign of mastering a three-man defence because, almost certainly, they have spent most of their careers to this point in a four. Thriving in a four is most likely where United found them.",
      "That is hardly unique to United’s squad. In 2023/24, the top 13 in the Premier League all played with a back four. Of course there were variations, but of the same theme. Of the bottom seven, more than half employed a back three, including two of the relegated clubs.",
      "Last season, 83% of the formations used in the top flight had a back four as its foundation. United account for almost a quarter of the usage of a back three.",
      "The patterns point at four being better than three. Especially when there’s no evidence that a back three suits the players available. But, principles.",
      "The midfield remains a problem whatever the shape due to the absence of a mobile defensive midfielder. A flaw United are aware of. But haven’t bothered to fix.",
      "Perhaps they are hoping Manuel Ugarte might yet come good. Or they can eke another season out of Casemiro’s legs. Regardless, if United stumble upon a top-class no.6, they may also unlock Kobbie Mainoo’s potential. The ceiling of which is far higher than Amorim believes in his system.",
      "United cannot make another attempt to fix their midfield until January at the earliest. Most likely it will be next summer. By which time Amorim will be long gone without some concessions on his part or a vast and sudden improvement that his precious formation looks incapable of delivering.",
      "Arsenal won away in the Champions League but are ‘completely predictable’, with that midfield trio inducing sleep.",
      "We have ranked the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ on their squad strength, using their ‘second XIs’. My word, Arsenal are good.",
      "Pep Guardiola sparked an identity crisis among shotstoppers but the signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma could serve as an olive branch to the Goalkeepers’ Union…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘found a replacement’ for head coach Ruben Amorim and there are three reasons behind their verdict.",
      "Spurs are only in the Champions League thanks to a ‘miracle’ and Thomas Frank is not the only one who will have to get used to the standard quickly.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would have to pay an ‘eye-watering’ sack bill if they part ways with head coach Ruben Amorim."

      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim sack; Emery, Maresca struggle; Arsenal, Woltemade shine",
      "Now, Amorim, who is the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, has 17 wins, 12 draws and 18 defeats from his 47 games in charge of Man Utd across all competitions. As much as the head coach has tried to clutch at the thinnest of straws to find positives from his 3-4-3 system, the brutal truth is that it’s not working and likely never will.",
      "Even following £230m summer arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens, Amorim’s formation is equally as ineffective as last season, and we are yet to see this formula improve any of Man Utd’s players.",
      "The latest exposé of Man Utd took place at the Etihad on Sunday as Amorim’s side lost 3-0 to Man City. Speaking post-match, Keane revealed his “worry” about the squad’s reaction to the 3-4-3 formation.",
      "“My worry is with the players now, maybe the players haven’t got that much faith in [Amorim’s formation].",
      "“So as much as the manager’s going ‘this is where we’re going lads’, and at the start you’re probably going ‘new manager, new ideas, something different’…but as the results don’t come and you keep getting beaten and you’re struggling against the better teams … it’s like they’re going around in circles.",
      "“If some of the players are now starting to doubt that – and I’m not saying they are, but you see the goals they’ve given away – and you’re going ‘are some of the players fully on board with this manager?’.”",
      "And a new report from journalist Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk has confirmed Keane’s “worry” by revealing ‘player frustrations’ at Man Utd.",

      "‘Players question his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace. “They back his passion, but the lack of in-game adjustments is frustrating,” a source disclosed.’",
      "As soon as internal leaks from Man Utd start to surface, it is a sign that their current head coach is on the exit ramp and we appear to have reached this stage of Amorim’s tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim may copy Vincent Kompany in sticking to his guns en route to landing a big job elsewhere, but he is going about it the wrong way if he wants to succeed at Man Utd, as his refusal to adapt will be looked back upon as the starting point of his road to be their latest post-Sir Alex Ferguson manager to be sacked.",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 10:14, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "Between the Lines returns with a look at his approach, a breakdown of how formations have evolved in the Premier League, and an examination of the system's issues at Manchester United.",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",
      "Paul Scholes. Still a No 10 at heart.",

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."

      "United's four points from as many games this season means the club have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, while Amorim himself now has the unenviable record of the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "To make matters worse, and illustrate the situation most starkly, since Amorim was appointed last November, United have amassed the fewest points of any ever-present Premier League side - averaging one per game, with a -13 goal difference.",
      "\"The performance was not good,\" he said after a 3-0 defeat to Man City. \"In the important moments, they were better than us.",
      "\"I'm trying to be rational. I see the record. I understand the frustration and I understand the decisions that come with that. I take the critics. That's it.\"",
      "When asked what message he might have for angered fans, many of whom left well before the final whistle at the Etihad, he said: \"My message? I will do everything. Always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"Until I'm here, I'll do my best. The rest is not my decision. I'm suffering more [than the fans].\"",
      "Much of the criticism levelled at Amorim involves the rigidity of his 3-4-2-1 system, and his vow never to deviate from a framework that, so far, has served his players poorly.",
      "Both balance and consistency are proving tough to come by, but the Portuguese was resolute in defence of his style once again after the derby defeat.",
      "\"There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"And we talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that in the system or whatever. So I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change it.",
      "\"I understand how football is and the results dictate the narrative. I see it that way. I know that is hard for people. The fans do not want to hear these things. I don't lie to myself. I see the record and I accept any decision.\"",

      "\"There have been times when I have seen United lose this type of match when I feel angry and frustrated.",
      "\"I just feel nothing, which is even worse. This has been a nothing of a performance. United have just been beaten.",
      "\"With Chelsea next week, another defeat and big questions would start to be asked.\"",
