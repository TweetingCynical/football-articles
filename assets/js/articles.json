      "The summer transfer window has kicked into gear, with bids flying in left, right and centre. Arsenal are pushing forward with a £50million move for Chelsea winger Noni Madueke after hitting a wall in talks with Sporting CP for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Their north London rivals Tottenham have sealed the £55m arrival of Mohammed Kudus. And Manchester United are still yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With seven weeks left before deadline day, there's plenty of time to negotiate down asking prices. After all, you don't get if you don't ask.",
      "Where else can you start but with Arsenal's laughable £40m+£1 stunt. After hearing about a supposed release clause in Luis Suarez's Liverpool contract, the Gunners submitted an offer that was one Great British pound over the sum in order to activate it in 2013.",
      "They were left with egg on their face when it turned out that it only required a potential move to be merely discussed, and wasn't a fully-fledged release clause. The bid was therefore swiftly rejected.",
      "It was much to the humour of Reds owner John W. Henry, whose iconic tweet remains on the platform, now X, to this day: \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\" Suarez, meanwhile, was convinced to commit to Anfield for another year by Steven Gerrard, before joining Barcelona in a £75m deal the following year.",
      "Doing business with one of your closest and fiercest rivals is never going to be straightforward, and there's often going to be an extra charge compared to if the player is being sold abroad. But Chelsea went the other way when they made a very cheeky attempt to sign Luka Modric from Spurs in 2011.",
      "They opened with a bid of £22m for Modric, who'd moved to White Hart Lane from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.6m three years earlier. His boss Harry Redknapp fumed: \"That is ridiculous. There are people being sold for £20m who are not fit to lace Luka's boots.\"",
      "Stamford Bridge chiefs did respond by upping their offer. But they were unable to hijack Real Madrid's move 12 months later, with the Croatian heading to the Spanish capital for around £30m – a sum that proved to be a steal.",
      "Clint Dempsey was coming off the season of his life in the summer of 2012 having scored 23 goals and registered seven assists in all competitions for Fulham. So you can forgive them for not rolling over when Liverpool came calling to the tune of just £3m.",
      "The Reds were very much in the midst of their banter era and their refusal to go any further than £4m once again left their rivals laughing at them. Although they did maybe dodge something of a bullet.",
      "Dempsey ultimately joined Spurs on deadline day for £6m. A return of 12 goals and seven assists was respectable enough, but he headed home to his native USA after just one season to join Seattle Sounders.",
      "Perhaps this should have been taken as a sign of things to come... United have been quite frankly tragic in the transfer market for over a decade, dating back to Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "When David Moyes took the reins, he was keen to bring with him some of Everton's most prized assets. His former club were in no mood to help him out when they received a £28m offer – for both Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines!",
      "\"Those bids were immediately rejected out of hand as derisory and insulting,\" a spokesperson for the Toffees slammed. It says it all about United's transfer nous that they then signed just Fellaini on deadline day for just £500k less than the joint bid.",
      "While all of the above have been intentionally insulting, Manchester City can be slightly excused here on the basis that they accidentally bid £30m for Lionel Messi. Although it does make it all the more embarrassing on their part.",
      "Former City executive Garry Cook explained the mix-up in ‘The Manchester City Years’ by Gary James. Sheikh Mansour had just completed his £210m takeover of the club in August 2009, with chiefs – located in Manchester, London and Abu Dhabi – scrambling to sign a forward before the window slammed shut.",
      "After failed swoops for Fernando Torres and Dimitar Berbatov, Cook explained: “He (an executive) made a comment like, ‘It’s all getting messy.’ Via the telephones and other communication lines, this somehow translated into, ‘Get Messi.’ An offer was made for Lionel Messi of about £30million. Needless to say, it was rejected.”",
      "Cherry picking a relegated club's top talent is always a fun exercise for the Premier League's big boys, who know full well the selling club are bent over a barrel. But there's still a line – and Spurs well and truly crossed that two years ago.",
      "Leicester City had one of the most stacked squads a relegated Premier League team has ever seen, and James Maddison and Harvey Barnes were both destined for big moves. £50m for both of them, however, was never going to fly.",
      "Maddison did end up signing on the ever-shameless Daniel Levy's dotted line, but he cost £40m alone, while Newcastle signed Barnes for £38m. Hey, you were nearly two thirds of the way there lads.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "There are seven weeks remaining of the transfer window and plenty of work still to be done. The Premier League has already seen some monumental deals but more await before the return of the season in a month's time.",
      "Liverpool set out to their work early and signed Florian Wirtz in a record deal in addition to adding new full-backs in the shape of Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez. A new defender and striker could yet be on the agenda with Marc Guehi and Hugo Etikike both linked - with potential for competition from Newcastle for both.",
      "Arsenal have not been shy in attempting to overcome the gaps to the Reds either. They've signed Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard in the last week, while Noni Madueke looks to be next to join the club from Chelsea.",
      "But anyone associated with the Gunners will be waiting with baited breath to discover whether a new striker finally arrives in north London. Viktor Gyokeres is on strike and attempting to force through a move to the Emirates from Sporting CP.",
      "Tottenham meanwhile have caused controversy in their attempt to land Morgan Gibbs-White. Nottingham Forest have accused them of an illegal approach as the Lilywhites' attempts to strengthen Thomas Frank's side are put on hold.",

      "There is still time for the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City to conduct more business too. And we'll keep you up to date with everything from around the Premier League and beyond below.",
      "Arsenal are close to another signing and Enzo Maresca isn't hiding that fact.",
      "\"Noni is in contact with a new club,\" said the Chelsea boss. \"I guess that he's going to leave in the next hours.",
      "\"I said in one of the last press conferences that at the end, if players want to leave, at the end, it's difficult for the club and for the manager. Noni decided to leave, nobody told Noni he had to leave. If he is happy, we are happy.\"",

      "Sporting's players were asked to report at 4:30pm but unsurprisingly, Gyokeres did not show, nor did he arrive in the hour window that followed before the team bus eventually set off.",
      "Crystal Palace have confirmed that any player who spent time on international duty in the summer is yet to return to training after Eberechi Eze missed their pre-season win over Millwall.",
      "The Eagles hosted their London rivals at Selhurst Park as they look to get up to speed, winning 1-0, but it was the absence of their leading light that caught the attention. Especially with transfer interest in the England international mounting.",
      "However the club underlined that Eze not being selected was unrelated to any potential move away, instead he had not began his pre-season yet and has been allowed an extended break. England last played on June 10 with Eze starting in attack as the Three Lions were stunned by Senegal.",
      "Liverpool are prepared to enter the race for Rodrygo, whose Real Madrid future appears incredibly uncertain, with Arsenal heavily linked with the Brazilian. The forward's game time has massively decreased and he has lost his starting spot over the summer.",
      "Arsenal want to bolster their forward line, but are closing in on the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea. It remains to be seen whether that would see their interest in Rodrygo cool, which could open the door for Liverpool if they needed to fill a hole in their squad.",
      "RMC Sport reports that the Reds will consider making a move, but only if they end up losing Luis Diaz this summer. The Colombian continues to be linked with pastures new as Barcelona and Bayern Munich circle, but they want to retain the winger despite his contract winding down.",

      "The Magpies are said to have contacted the French star's agent to express their desire having previously missed out on the player.",
      "Ekitike has a release clause of €100m (£86m) and Newcastle's move could put Liverpool under pressure to make their own.",
      "Maybe such a significant signing could indicate that Newcastle are preparing for an Isak exit next summer however. It will be interesting how it plays out.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas has not been put under pressure by Viktor Gyokeres' decision not to turn up for pre-season and has sent a warning to Arsenal.",
      "“If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we're very comfortable with that for the next three years,\" said Varandas.",

As per the clauses inserted in the deal that took Elanga from Manchester to Nottingham, United will land 15 percent of profit on any deal. Given he moved for £55m, United are said to have picked up around £6m of the fee, reports The Telegraph.",

He moved to Portugal 12 months ago for around £7m, which means Benfica will pocket around £36m of profit. 20 percent of that - £7.2m - will go to United and further bolster their summer budget.",

      "In a recent interview with France Football, Gyokeres hailed the impact Amorim has had on his career. \"I came here, it's been great since day one, I've developed a lot here with the team,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a lot of amazing memories together as a team, winning two championships in a row, for the first time in 71 years I think it is, it's an amazing achievement.",
      "\"Of course, Amorim played a big part of this because he was the one who really wanted me here and his style of football that we played under him suited me very well, I think. I can't thank him enough. The style of play we had under him suited me perfectly.",
      "\"It was a shock [when Amorim joined United last year], I'd never seen a coach leave in the middle of the season when everything was going so well. No hard feelings. Yes, it was surprising, but I totally understand his decision.\"",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, have already signed Kepa Arrizabalaga Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard this summer and are also closing in on a deal for Chelsea winger Noni Madueke.",
      "When asked about Madueke's future at the Club World Cup, Blues boss Enzo Maresca told reporters: \"My message to the players and to the club is that I want just players that are happy to be with us.",
      "\"The ones that are not happy, they are free to go. It's not for Noni, it's for all the players we have. But again, Noni has been very good during the season and very good tonight.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford's future Manchester United remains unclear and he arrived at training eight minutes after Ruben Amorim departed - but the club claim this is not an unusual situation.",
      "The forward is back at the club for pre-season having spent the second part of the recent campaign at Aston Villa, whom he joined on loan after being frozen out in Manchester. Those at Villa Park opted against triggering their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "Rashford arrived at Carrington at 4.47pm on his own on Thursday, eight minutes after his head coach had departed. The MEN claims the 27-year-old has been training in the afternoons on an individual basis this week and his late arrival was just part of his schedule. Rashford arrived through the back gate entrance at Carrington, whilst Amorim used the front gate.",
      "The club have denied that the academy graduate was arriving at the club's training base to discuss his future, which remains unclear as he and Amorim still don't appear to see eye-to-eye after the United boss was a vocal critic of some of Rashford's behaviours when he first arrived.",
      "Rashford scored the first goal of the Amorim era when he notched in a draw Ipswich in late November, but quickly he saw his minutes decline. He was dropped for the Manchester derby at the Etihad and never found a way back.",
      "Amorim later claimed he would rather include one of the United coaches, who is into his 60s, on his bench instead of Rashford. He also criticised the forward's application in training and said they could not align their views on key issues.",
      "He said after sanctioning his loan exit: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different.\"",
      "In another telling sign that Rashford will be looking for a new club this summer he has seen his shirt number taken away - and he hasn't been handed a new one - after United decided to give the No10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Rashford last played for United against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on December 12. It is understood that the player's dream move would be to Barcelona, but so far they've pursued other targets. The likes of Newcastle have been credited with interest, but on loan, whilst the Manchester outfit want an end to the saga and would prefer a permanent exit.",

      "Manchester United have not even played their first pre-season friendly of the summer and already they have been rocked by an injury setback.",

      "Furthermore, it means he is at risk of possibly missing the start of the new Premier League season. United face Arsenal in their season opener at Old Trafford on August 17.",

      "Amorim wants to recruit a goalkeeper this summer that can challenge and compete with Onana for the No.1 spot.",
      "Despite making several high-profile errors last season, the Cameroonian often started by default amid doubts about Altay Bayindir's suitability as United's second-choice goalkeeper. The Turkish international, who joined the club from Fenerbahce in September 2023, has made just 11 appearances for United, conceding 20 goals.",
      "United made the decision to offer a new contract to veteran shot-stopper Tom Heaton last month, tying him down to a new one-year deal, meaning he is highly likely to remain third in the goalkeeping pecking order this season.",
      "With that in mind, United are likely to target the addition of a new goalkeeper with a view to replacing Bayindir and taking second spot in the pecking order. The former Fenerbahce man is likely to be sold this summer.",
      "However, news of Onana's injury means Bayindir could be needed for a little while longer yet. He will expect to be a regular throughout pre-season.",
      "On the flip side, United could use Onana's injury as an excuse to try and source a new second-choice goalkeeper as quickly as possible, with a view to getting him up to speed ahead of the start of the season and potentially starting the campaign in goal.",
      "United are rightly prioritising attacking signings this summer and are still optimistic about making Bryan Mbeumo their next signing. Talks with Brentford are too far down the line for United to suddenly prioritise the addition of a goalkeeper over the Cameroonian.",
      "But should the Reds make a breakthrough in their pursuit for Mbeumo sooner rather than later, their priority after getting him through the door may have to become the addition of a goalkeeper.",
      "As already documented, United wanted to sign a shot-stopper this summer to challenge Onana, meaning news of his injury setback could see that particular objective become more important than first thought.",
      "United are unlikely to want to go into the start of the season, should Onana fail to recover in time, with Bayindir between the posts amid the possibility of him getting injured and putting pay to any hopes they have of selling him before the end of the window.",
      "Instead, it would be much wiser for United to try and source an upgrade on the Turkish international, as per their original plan, and attempt to embed a new shot-stopper in the team in pre-season with a view to the chosen candidate generating some healthy competition for Onana to become Amorim's No.1."

      "United saw an opening offer of £55m turned down in the first week of June before submitting a second offer, understood to be in excess of £60m, just over a fortnight ago. It looked as though that offer was set to be enough to lure him to Old Trafford.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Brentford are holding out for as high a fee as possible for the Cameroon international. There has been increasing speculation that £70m is the magic number the Londoners are looking for.",

      "Fortunately, United are poised to generate cash from elsewhere this summer. Former winger Anthony Elanga finalised his switch from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United on Friday night and the Reds are in line to inherit a percentage of the initial £52m fee the Midlands outfit have banked.",
      "When United sold the Swede to Forest in July 2023, they inserted a sell-on clause into the deal, ensuring they would benefit from him improving at the City Ground and then potentially being sold. United will bank 15 per cent of the profit Forest have made on Elanga, meaning they will bank somewhere in the region of £5.5m.",

      "It is claimed he will join Madrid for £43.3m. Benfica paid just over £5m to sign him from United and once again the Reds inserted a sell-on clause to benefit from a potential sale.",
      "Just like in the case of Elanga, United will earn a percentage of the profit. With United in line for a 20 per cent cut, they look set to inherit £7.62m.",
      "Meanwhile, former United youngster Maxi Oyedele continues to be linked with an exit from Legia Warsaw less than a year after arriving from Old Trafford. The Reds sold him for a minimal fee, but covered themselves by inserting a sell-on clause into the deal.",
      "He excelled in his debut season in Poland, helping Legia win the Polish Cup, and he is now attracting interest from a cluster of European clubs, including from the Championship. His release clause is worth €6m (£5.2m at the current exchange rate).",
      "With United understood to be entitled to 40 per cent of that fee, they will secure around £2m in the event of him being sold this summer.",
      "It means United could find themselves inheriting up to £15.12m from the sales of players they sold in previous windows. It is not a sum that could be described as game-changing for a club of United's stature, but it could make all the difference in their pursuit of Mbeumo."

      "Manchester United are arguably in need of a new striker this summer, and one is seemingly available for transfer. Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing Gyokeres in the past, as the striker looks increasingly likely to leave Sporting Lisbon this summer. However, it seems that Arsenal are the most likely destination for Gyokeres if he was to leave the Primeira Liga outfit.",
      "Speculation around United's need for a new striker has only intensified the rumours around the futures of existing members of the squad. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are United's current centre forwards, but a new signing being brought to Old Trafford would likely leave their futures in doubt.",
      "Amid the speculation around his future, Gyokeres recently took part in an interview with L'Equipe where he offered hints about his future. When asked about the possibility of leaving Sporting, Gyokeres admitted: “Maybe.",
      "“That's football, you never know. I don't think about it; we'll see what happens.",
      "“If something happens, it will. The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me.”",
      "Gyokeres even spoke about his feelings towards a move to the Premier League. And it seems that the Sporting star would like to return to England, with his exit from Coventry City taking place three years ago.",
      "“It's one of the biggest leagues in Europe,\" said Gyokeres.",
      "“I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it's something I'd like to do. It would be a great revenge!”",
      "Rather interestingly, the interview with L'Equipe was published on July 12 - the day that Gyokeres was meant to return to pre-season training for Sporting. It's also been stated that the interview was conducted on July 7 - the original date that Gyokeres was meant to report back for training before being granted extra time off by the club.",
      "There have since been various reports that Gyokeres has no plans to play for Sporting again as he pushes for a move to the Premier League, particularly to Arsenal. Sporting are thought to value Gyokeres at around £70million, and it still remains to be seen where he will be playing his football next term.",
      "Given the timing of the interview that has now been published, you would be forgiven for believing that Gyokeres does not plan on playing for Sporting again anytime soon. Whether this will give United any hope of beating Arsenal to his signature, though, is another matter.",
      "While United's search for a new striker goes on and Gyokeres' future is unresolved, there will always be speculation that a move to Old Trafford may not be completely out of the question."

      "The longer it takes Manchester United to sell their unwanted players, the longer it is going to take for Ruben Amorim to add fresh faces to his squad.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha last month, progress has slowed on the transfer front at Old Trafford. United have become bogged down in negotiations with Brentford over signing Bryan Mbeumo and an increasing number of supporters are becoming concerned.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and know their best hope of avoiding a repeat of that in 2025/26 is by strengthening their armoury in this summer's transfer window.",
      "The Reds have prioritised strengthening their attack this summer and the addition of Cunha last month was their way of putting down an early marker. He scored 17 goals for Wolves last season and cost United £62.5million.",
      "Before Cunha had even finalised his switch to M16, United had tabled an opening offer for Mbeumo. After seeing their £55m offer knocked back, United returned with a second bid just over a fortnight ago, understood to be in excess of £60m.",
      "However, Brentford are standing firm and United are yet to reach their valuation of the Cameroonian. Mbeumo is becoming frustrated at the length of time negotiations are taking as he is prioritising a move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In addition to wanting to sign Mbeumo, United also want to sign an out-and-out centre-forward. The addition of a proven goalscorer this summer is paramount after ending last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10.",
      "Having signed Cunha and setting their sights on Mbeumo, getting an established No.9 through the door would be the cherry on the icing on the cake for United. The elephant in the room, however, is that they are reliant on sales this summer to fund new additions.",
      "United are prioritising the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony this summer, and are also open to selling Alejandro Garnacho at the right price. The quartet are not currently training with the first-team squad at Carrington.",
      "Alongside Tyrell Malacia, the quartet informed United of their interest in leaving the club just over a week ago. United have valued Rashford at £40m, Antony is available at £32.58m and Sancho is believed to be up for grabs for somewhere between £20m-£25m.",
      "Garnacho, however, is valued higher. He scored 11 goals and registered ten assists for United last season and has three years left on his contract, meaning United should be striving to command as high a fee as possible for the talented Argentine.",
      "The 21-year-old was the subject of a £40m bid from Napoli in the January window, but United rebuffed their offer as it fell short of their valuation. The Reds should be demanding £50m at the very least for a player of Garnacho's quality and potential.",
      "With an asking price of somewhere between £50m-£60m a rough guideline for Garnacho, United will be determined to secure as high a price as possible for the youngster. He has made 144 appearances for the club, scoring 26 goals, meaning it is an impressive record for a player that only celebrated his 21st birthday earlier this month.",
      "If United are successful in their attempts to sell Garnacho, and command a fee of £50m or more, it will mark the first time since the sale of Romelu Lukaku in August 2019 they will have secured £50m or more from a sale.",
      "The Belgian joined the Italian club six years ago for almost £74m, making him the second most expensive sale in United's history behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who swapped Old Trafford for Real Madrid back in 2009.",
      "United's track record in the seller's market leaves a lot to be desired, with the Reds often struggling to squeeze every penny out of the buying club when it comes to a sale. It is an area of the business that still needs to improve.",
      "But with the club desperate to bring in new faces this summer, they need to raise every penny they possibly can via sales. Getting north of £50m for Garnacho would be a huge step in the right direction."

      "Manchester United will step up their pre-season preparations when they face Leeds United in their opening friendly of the summer at the Friends Arena in Stockholm next Saturday.",
      "The clash with Daniel Farke's men, who won promotion back to the Premier League last season, will almost certainly mark Matheus Cunha's debut in a United shirt.",
      "The Brazilian arrived from Wolves for £62.5million last month and will be keen to enjoy a strong pre-season campaign ahead of the competitive action commencing in mid-August.",
      "Cunha was a top target for United head coach Ruben Amorim, meaning he is poised to become a staple in his first-choice starting XI this season.",
      "Well-versed in a 3-4-2-1 formation from his time at Molineux, Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Amorim's system. He regularly operated in that role at Wolves, meaning he should be able to settle into the groove at Old Trafford relatively comfortably.",
      "Amid the expectation that Cunha will cement himself as United's left-sided playmaker, captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to operate in central midfield permanently this season. The Portuguese international often played as one of the two No.8s in the second half of last term and regularly looked more dangerous.",
      "He enjoyed a real purple patch after initially being tasked with operating deeper, providing both goals and assists. Playing deeper also allows him to scan the game and help dictate proceedings.",
      "With Fernandes expected to become a No.8 on a full-time basis, it means one of the two central midfield spots in Amorim's system is already sealed.",
      "Therefore, Amorim will be hoping to witness some healthy competition throughout pre-season in the race to start the campaign as Fernandes' midfield partner.",
      "United want to sign a midfielder this summer, but they are having to prioritise attacking additions instead. They are still in talks with Brentford to sign Bryan Mbeumo and they are yet to source a striker.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United must prioritise the addition of a No.9 over a new midfielder this summer.",
      "With that in mind, pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season as Fernandes' midfield partner. Manuel Ugarte, who was recruited from Paris Saint-Germain almost a year ago, will believe he is a worthy candidate to start, likewise fellow midfield enforcer Casemiro.",
      "Ugarte joined United last August with the ambition of fixing their midfield problems. His debut season at the club featured a collection of up and down performances, with concerns often being shared about his ability on the ball.",
      "As a midfield enforcer, though, he was able to flex his muscles, offering United a sense of bite and aggression in the engine room. Casemiro, on the other hand, struggled to deal with the intensity of the Premier League, saving his best performances for the Europa League.",
      "The Brazilian could be sold this summer amid the fact his contract is up next summer. The addition of a new midfielder could spell the end of his Old Trafford career.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to make up for lost time this season after a stop-start 2024/25 campaign. He struggled to get into any sort of rhythm last term because of both injuries and being tasked with operating as either a No.8 or a No.10.",
      "In truth, Mainoo joining forces with Fernandes in midfield will leave United short of defensive nous and bite in the engine room. Mainoo is a forward-thinking player, who likes to take the ball on the half turn, glide past his man and get into attacking positions.",
      "The only way in which Fernandes and Mainoo could potentially join forces in the middle is if United were to revert to a three-man midfield and had a defensive specialist alongside them. That, though, is not going to happen under Amorim's watch.",
      "Toby Collyer will also believe he is worthy of an opportunity to impress in pre-season, but he will have his work cut out to try and leapfrog Ugarte, Casemiro and Mainoo in the pecking order.",
      "Nevertheless, he will determined to prove his worth ahead of the competitive action kicking off next month. He has offered glimpses of his capabilities and will not give up on attempting to become a regular starter.",
      "Whatever happens, a healthy level of competition can only be a good thing for Amorim."

      "United’s pre-season preparations will conclude with a home fixture against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9.",
      "Having already signed Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon in this window, United could also have Bryan Mbeumo available for pre-season. With that in mind, MEN Sport takes a look at the latest transfer rumours in and around Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo is expected to arrive at United before the squad goes on tour, according to The Telegraph.",
      "A breakthrough in negotiations is expected soon as United prepare to welcome Mbeumo, weeks after initiating talks with Brentford.",
      "At this stage, however, it's unclear what figure has been 'agreed' with the Bees for the Cameroon international.",
      "MEN Sport says: If true, having Mbeumo available for pre-season would be a major boost for Amorim and his coaching staff. The winger’s integration into the squad in the next few weeks before the season starts, would allow him to build chemistry with new teammates, adapt to Amorim’s tactical demands, and hit the ground running when the season begins.",
      "It’s also a welcome relief after what has been a drawn-out transfer saga - one that arguably took longer than necessary to conclude.",
      "Newcastle United have reportedly rekindled their interest in Hugo Ekitike, who has also been the subject of interest from United.",
      "The Telegraph have reported that the Magpies' attention has turned to the striker after missing out on signing Joao Pedro, who opted to join Chelsea from Brighton.",
      "It's said the Magpies have already 'informed' Ekitike's representatives of their desire to sign him. The 23-year-old's release clause is reportedly around €100million (£86m).",
      "MEN Sport says: This news could come as a significant blow if Newcastle do follow through on their interest. Between Newcastle and United, Eddie Howe's side may have a slight edge, having secured European football for the upcoming season. United, desperate to strengthen up front after last season's struggles in front of goal, would have viewed Ekitike as a valuable new option for Amorim.",
      "The young attacker would offer something different from Rasmus Hojlund but Newcastle’s renewed interest now poses a real threat to any deal."

      "Despite making a flying start to this summer's window, announcing they had reached an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha 14 hours after it opened on June 1, progress has been slow at Old Trafford.",
      "United have become bogged down in negotiations with Brentford over signing Bryan Mbeumo, meaning other objectives they want to try and complete this summer are yet to be properly explored.",
      "The Reds have prioritised strengthening their attacking options after recording a negative goal difference for the second Premier League campaign running last term and the decision to commit £62.5million to the signing of Cunha has been applauded.",
      "He scored 17 goals last season, meaning he will add a much-needed goal threat to United's attack. The club remains hopeful Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, will soon join the Brazilian at Old Trafford.",
      "However, United need to do more in the attacking department before the start of the season than just sign Mbeumo. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what deals United need to complete to revamp their forward line ahead of the big kick off.",
      "As already documented, United are still striving to reach an agreement with Brentford to sign Mbeumo. The 25-year-old has been the subject of two offers from the Reds and the second - understood to be in excess of £60m - looked as though it would be enough.",
      "Both United and Mbeumo are equally keen to get the deal done. The attacker informed Brentford at the beginning of June that he wants to move to M16.",
      "It is widely believed United want to sign Mbeumo to install him as their right-sided No.10. Cunha is expected to operate as the left-sided No.10, meaning United are looking to give their attack a completely new look.",
      "That, of course, is because the club remains determined to sign an out-and-out centre-forward. United need to invest in a reliable goalscorer this summer and the prospect of ending the summer without having recruited one could prove to be very costly.",
      "Liam Delap was identified as United's primary striker target ahead of the start of the summer amid his £30m release clause at Ipswich Town, but he was snapped up by Chelsea. He held talks with United and other Premier League clubs before moving to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Although missing out on Delap was not as big a blow as some suggested given he only has one full season of top flight football under his belt, it has had an impact on United's search for a No.9. They have been linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and several others, but they are not believed to have tabled a concrete offer for a goalscorer yet.",
      "The problem United are facing, of course, is that they need to sell players to bring in new faces, and that has so far been easier said than done.",
      "Missing out on Champions League qualification for 2025/26 has significantly reduced United's revenue streams, meaning they need to be smart this summer.",
      "Having already spent £62.5m on Cunha and being prepared to spend possibly a little bit more on Mbeumo, United need to make their presence felt in the seller's market. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony were identified as priority sales in May, while Alejandro Garnacho was informed he will be allowed to leave at the right price.",
      "The quartet, alongside defender Tyrell Malacia, informed United last week they want to leave the club this summer to explore different opportunities, meaning both the players and the club are aligned in the direction they want to head in.",
      "United value Rashford at £40m, Antony is available at £32.58m and Sancho is on offer for somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m. Garnacho is valued at north of £50m.",
      "If United can command the aforementioned prices for those four players and get them off the books, it would go a long way towards boosting their chances of overseeing more incomings, both in attack and elsewhere in the squad.",

      "United activated the £62.5m release clause in Matheus Cunha's contract early last month, bringing the Wolves forward to Old Trafford on a five-year deal with an option for an extra year. Paraguayan left-back Diego Leon has also joined the club, but may be loaned out."

      "Very good chance we’re projecting a little bit here, but if there were a theme to this summer’s Premier League transfer business thus far it would be Okay, You’ve Had Your Fun.",

And everyone really enjoyed watching Tottenham and Manchester United be astonishing levels of sh*t for astonishing periods of time, right up until Spurs somehow unSpursed themselves at the best/worst possible moment.",

      "Let’s not pretend that the biggest clubs buying the best players from the other clubs in the league is a brand new phenomenon, but we’re not even at the middle of July yet and the heart has been ripped out of several of the upstarts who made last season so different.",
      "And it’s the big clubs doing that ripping. Four of the traditional Big Six are currently Europe’s four biggest spenders this summer, and all of them have moved to take some of the best players from elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool have Milos Kerkez. Chelsea have Joao Pedro. Tottenham have Mohammed Kudus, even if they have managed to Spurs their pursuit of Morgan Gibbs-White up. Man City have got themselves a Rayat Ait-Nouri.",
      "Arsenal will be very much in the top five once they and Sporting stop their absurd game of chicken and just get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres as we all know they eventually will once everyone can agree a way to proceed that allows everyone to feel like they’ve won. They’ve also got themselves a Christian Norgaard to continue the theme anyway.",
      "Man United sneak into the top 10 as well after signing Wolves lunatic Matheus Cunha, and again the only reason they’re not higher is because Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t yet decided precisely which and how many unimportant disposable meatbags he needs to sack to scrape together enough coppers to get himself a Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Is it too early to officially Fear for Brentford? We really think it might not be. They must have known the day would come that Thomas Frank tried his luck at somewhere bigger and also probably stupider, and he will certainly be doing those things.",
      "One of the most interesting things we thought we might learn next season was just how good Frank is, and that this would involve not just what he did at Spurs but what Brentford did in his absence. How much of Brentford’s success has been down to him personally? How able is he to replicate that in a very, very different environment?",
      "But Brentford appear to be about to take on that challenge in even more extreme circumstances than anyone could have imagined. They approach the dizzying uncertainty of life without their inspirational manager – and several members of his backroom staff – also without Norgaard, who did so much to make them tick, as well as almost certainly Mbeumo and quite possibly Yoane Wissa.",
      "And promoting a manager from within represents an admirable but enormous gamble. The desire for some continuity may be understandable, but when you don’t have continuity of players we do wonder how prudent a move that actually is.",
      "The good news for Brentford is that they are far from alone. Wolves have lost Cunha and Ait-Nouri. Brighton have lost Pedro. Forest are about to lose Anthony Elanga and Gibbs-White. Bournemouth have lost Kerkez and Dean Huijsen – even Real Madrid are helping out their big-club mates – while Palace will surely be stripped of some combination of Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and very likely the Europa League.",
      "West Ham’s situation is slightly different, with the sanctioning of Kudus’ sale even to the worst possible place very likely a pretty smart, hard-headed decision to generate significant funds for their squad rebuild by offloading a player who doesn’t quite fit with the new manager’s plans. But it’s still another chastening reminder of how the land lies.",
      "These clubs have all trod this path before and at least some of them will be absolutely fine and possibly even improve for smartly reinvesting that cash in new, cheaper players who go on to become the next big-money signings for the larger beasts.",
      "Last season’s upsetting of the Premier League applecart came about in large part because the money sloshing around the Premier League is such that even the division’s proletariat now find themselves with spending power to outgun pretty much anyone outside the superclubs anywhere else.",
      "But right now it’s an uncomfortable time for a lot of the Premier League’s middle-class as the old order seeks to re-establish itself at their enormous expense."

      "Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona may never materialise as the Spanish giants have reportedly selected an alternative, Ademola Lookman.",
      "Rashford’s time at Manchester United is realistically over, but both he and the club are struggling to find an exit route.",
      "The 27-year-old spent half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but has made it clear that he favours a move to Barcelona, with the Catalan club looking to strengthen their attacking depth.",
      "Initially, it looked as if Rashford’s move would not come to be with Barceloan going all out to sign Nico Williams, only for the 22-year-old to go sign a ten-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Rashford then would have been hopeful about his chances, but a report from Spain suggests Barcelona are going after an alternative, former Everton winger Lookman.",
      "Sport, a newspaper based in Barcelona, says head coach Hansi Flick ‘likes’ the 27-year-old and that he could be available for less than €50 million.",
      "“The Blaugrana have other options on the table, such as Rafa Leao, and are also reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation of Atalanta star Ademola Lookman,” journalist Lluis Miguelsanz said. “He’s a player Flick likes, but his situation isn’t encouraging because relations with his entourage are currently strained.",
      "“Lookman has been trying for years to make the big leap from Atalanta to a top-flight Champions League club, but so far no one has taken the step to sign him.",
      "“The Italian club took a chance by signing him from Leipzig for €10 million, and he’s exploded onto the scene. He’s been gaining international prominence and is now a more mature player, although he needs to take a definitive step to establish himself at the elite level, as his performance is still very inconsistent.",
      "“He’s a pure winger, fast and capable of scoring goals. And he can play in all attacking positions, something Barça highly valued in Luis Díaz, the leading candidate to fill that position if financially possible. Atalanta would be willing to negotiate his sale for less than €50 million because his contract expires in 2027 and he hasn’t renewed yet, and Tottenham are strongly interested in signing him.”",
      "One stumbling block, though, could be Lookman’s choice of agency and their involvement with an ongoing issue at Barcelona.",
      "“The major handicap is that Lookman shares a representation agency with Marc-André ter Stegen, and problems with the goalkeeper are brewing.",
      "“The German will push hard to stay at Barça, and this could create an awkward situation for all parties, which could significantly impact relations with Lookman’s entourage. For now, Barça only has information about his situation, like that of many wingers, but nothing has been done about it.”",
      "Meanwhile, transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano says Rashford is “very open” to the Barcelona move and is “basically waiting for Barca.”",
      "“Marcus Rashford would be very keen on a move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is very open to that opportunity. I always told you since January and I keep repeating that Rashford would love Barca move and he’s basically waiting for Barca move because he has many opportunities.",
      "“Rashford is losing the number 10. He was informed 24 hours before about that, through his agents of course, but let me say that it’s not just Marcus Rashford desire to leave Manchester United.",
      "“All of this also starts from Manchester United desire to part ways from Marcus Rashford since January and continuing this summer. So it’s not only Rashford who wants to leave United but there is also United who are pushing the opportunity to sell Marcus Rashford or to find a solution for him this summer.",
      "“When I say Man United it’s the management, it’s the coach Ruben Amorim. So all parties are going to the same direction for Marcus Rashford to leave.”",

      "Jordan Henderson is heading to London, while Barcelona have decided to give Marcus Rashford the move he craves. But can they give Manchester United what they want?",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nDespite speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao, many reports suggest a deal has been agreed with United and it’s now down to Sancho to decide if how much he might be prepared to sacrifice to kickstart his career. The signs so far: not much…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "11) Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is reportedly close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nChelsea have agreed a fee with Arsenal – £52m, says Orny – and the winger has been given permission to fly back before the Club World Cup final to have a medical with the Gunners. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

      "It is not exactly made clear and indeed Chris Wheeler has been ever so slightly stitched-up. His four mentions of Rashford in a wide-ranging piece include: how Man Utd want to sell him; that he has returned to training early and with an excellent attitude; and that the other players the club want rid of have chosen not to do so, as it their wont.",

      "Does Forest making an offer about £30m below Brentford’s valuation of Wissa really constitute a ‘fresh twist’ over Man Utd’s pursuit of Mbeumo? No. If anything it reflects better on Man Utd who are far closer to finding a breakthrough in negotiations. But also obviously yes if you need to pretend things are happening at Old Trafford.",

      "Good lord. There are some similarities in underlying numbers and style but it is a frankly ludicrous and unhelpful comparison.",
      "And pretending ‘it signals the sale of a player who perhaps epitomises BlueCo’s model better than any other’ is also quite weird for two reason: the £52m sale itself of a player Chelsea signed for £29m less than two years ago epitomises that model, as does the fact ‘his replacement is an 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid who is a talented but still relatively unknown outside of South America in Estevao Willian’.",
      "This is remarkably BlueCo Chelsea.",
      "Madueke’s modest output last season is then excused because it is ‘important to remember he had Nicolas Jackson on the end of many chances he was creating’.",
      "Why that didn’t stop six different Chelsea players assisting at least one of Jackson’s 13 goals but held Madueke back to the extent he set up fewer goals than Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George and Jackson himself last season is unknown.",
      "‘With Liam Delap and Joao Pedro already looking clinical in the Club World Cup, Chelsea’s frontline next season could have represented an opportunity for Madueke to explode into the player most fans know he can become.’",

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",

He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",

Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",

Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",

      "I really hope that this is the year you get relegated, last year was a close call and Ruben is going to keep his terrible form because he’s not that good, they’ll sack him before Christmas as they should but which idiot will take the poisoned chalice, a lot of managers have taken the United job and none have come out of the other end smelling of roses (maybe the little Norwegian but his other jobs were Molde and Cardiff), you won’t get a good manager and even if you do it won’t matter because you’re poor and will come close to the bottom 3 again (hopefully Leeds spends this mystical £300 million so they can overtake you).",

      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",

      "",
      "21) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",

      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",

Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",

      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",

      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’."

      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “David Ornstein, who’s a friend of the channel, has reported that he [Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he’s told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford’s valuation.",
      "“I think the proposal is £55m with £7.5m add-ons. That doesn’t seem to be enough, maybe, for Brentford, but I think Man United have to get this done. I think it’s been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn’t happen.",
      "“I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?",
      "“We haven’t heard, really, any other names that it seems to be getting close with. So, I’ll be surprised if this deal doesn’t go through, because Man United have been adamant. It’s gone public, they’ve allowed that to happen, and they’re in a position now where they’ve got to make a move to kind of get this over the line.”",
      "Ferdinand is clearly a fan of Mbeumo’s profile, though, stating: “He fits the bill for me physically. He’s dynamic, scores goals in the Premier League, knows the Premier League. Watch this space.”",
      "A recent report suggested United are positive about their chances of landing the Brentford forward before their tour of America.",
      "That begins on July 22, so the Red Devils are ‘confident’ that they’ll have Mbeumo in under two weeks.",

      "He is now being pursued by Juventus, who seem eager to land the winger, if they can finance a deal.",
      "But talkSPORT broadcaster Alan Brazil feels a return to Dortmund – where Sancho scored 50 goals and chipped in with 64 assists in his spell as a permanent player there from 2017 to 2021 – is the best course of action.",
      "“I think he had his best time at Dortmund. If I were him, I’d go there because they love him there, he feels comfortable,” he said.",
      "“Are Juve going to be up there? You want to go there with a chance of winning something.”",
      "But interest from Dortmund is not currently evident, while Juventus are clearly eager to land the winger. Interest from the European giants has been reported for months, and there are various avenues being followed for them to land him.",
      "It has been suggested that there are a couple of potential swap deals in the works, with Juventus pair Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic both separately having been offered to United.",
      "Whether that is the avenue which will land Juventus Sancho remains to be seen, but it seems he’s open to the move.",
      "Reports have suggested that he’s willing to take a pay cut to land in Turin, with a £115,000-per-week (€133,000) contract is being discussed, which would see Sancho’s wage cut by more than half.",
      "It is said he has taken ‘drastic action’ in terms of lowering his demands in order to ensure that move happens.",

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal is a done deal. Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "Arsenal have announced that they have completed their third summer signing, while Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that another transfer is “absolutely on”.",
      "Arsenal continue to make moves in the summer transfer market with their third signing set to be confirmed this week.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",

      "Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.",
      "There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",
      "United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.",
      "The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.",
      "Rashford's preference is a move to Barca, who have explored the conditions of a deal, but they have other targets in that position too such as Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "Williams has signed a new contract at Athletic Club and Liverpool have rejected all approaches for Diaz, however.",
      "Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger.",
      "Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal - but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.",
      "However, for United to consider another loan this summer, it is thought they would want an obligation to buy him attached.",
      "The Betis president has admitted a permanent deal is difficult to do given the finances involved.",
      "Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.",
      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
      "Juve have other targets, including Porto's Francsico Conceicao, however, and Sky in Italy are reporting that the Portugal international is their preferred choice.",
      "Conceicao was on a season-long loan in Turin last season and, until and including July 15, his release clause is €30m, which Porto want paid up front in full, although it goes up to €45m on July 16.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
