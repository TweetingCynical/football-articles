      "Man United will mark the 66th anniversary of the tragedy on Tuesday when they will remember the eight brilliant Busby Babes killed when a plane taking them home from a European Cup tie in Belgrade crashed on take-off after a refuelling stop in Bavaria",
      "Erik ten Hag has described how the Munich Air Disaster is a major driving force behind his dream of bringing the glory days back to Manchester United.",
      "United will mark the 66th anniversary of the tragedy on Tuesday when they will remember the eight brilliant Busby Babes killed when a plane taking them home from a European Cup tie in Belgrade crashed on take-off after a refuelling stop in Bavaria.",
      "Twenty-three people died in the accident - including eight journalists. But manager Matt Busby recovered from serious injuries to build a team that became European champions 10 years later.",
      "Ten Hag, who will attend a memorial ceremony at Old Trafford to mark the anniversary, said: \"Munich tells a lot about the legacy of this club and the DNA of this club.‌ Having big setbacks, tragedy, but fighting back with young players who should express resilience.",
      "‌\"Munich was a disaster for the club. How the club recovered from it, how individuals recovered from it, it was great. From such a disaster, to survive it and a couple of years later you're lifting the biggest trophy in European football, that is immense.",
      "\"We should always remember this. This is the legacy of why Manchester United exists - and what we should match as a club, as a team, as individuals.\"",
      "‌Ten Hag was touched by tragedy himself in 1989 when one of his FC Twente team-mates was killed in a plane crash in Surinam. Andy Scharmin was a promising 21-year-old left-back who rejected the chance to play for Holland at the Toulon Tournament so that he could travel to the homeland of his parents to feature in a charity game.",
      "Scharmin was one of 15 players who died. His mum and aunt also perished in a disaster that claimed 176 lives - and Ten Hag always pays tribute to his close friend on the anniversary of the accident.",
      "Ten Hag admitted that he has a responsibility to keep the legacy that the Busby Babes left in 1958 by giving United's youth players a pathway to the first team.",
      "He added: \"I've always been driven by this motivation and that is one of the reasons why I’m here, to develop young players. You need patience but you also need the right structures, capable coaches in the academy, but also personalities you have to develop. To bring young players in is a big advantage because they know the DNA of the club.\""

      "MAN UTD vs WEST HAM: James Ward-Prowse believes both his and Kalvin Phillips' Euro 2024 aspirations can help inspire the Hammers to yet another succesful season under David Moyes",
      "James Ward-Prowse has warned Manchester United that West Ham will go for the jugular at Old Trafford.",
      "And with Manchester City treble-winning loanee Kalvin Phillips now on board - winning is the only option as the Hammers look to execute a memorable double over Erik ten Hag's herky-jerky side following the 2-0 home victory on December 23.",
      "Ward-Prowse said after scoring in the 1-1 midweek draw with Bournemouth: \"We now go to a place like Old Trafford looking to win and believing we can win the game. That's a real positive sign of how far the club has come. It's a unique place to go and a really exciting challenge.\"",
      "Ward-Prowse has been particularly impressed by the quality of Phillips - despite his disastrous back-pass to Dominic Solanke just three minutes into his Irons debut.",
      "When asked if his arrival had provided a boost behind the scenes, he said of his new club team-mate: \"Really special. He's got a lot of experience in big matches.",
      "\"He's been at a big club in City for a number of years and I'm sure he's got a point to prove. It's great to have him in the squad and hopefully, he can have a real benefit for us moving forward.\"",
      "Much like Phillips - Ward-Prowse is using his England Euro 2024 dream as fuel for success this season in east London. He is optimistic both he and Phillips can help bring the best from one another to book their place on the plane to Germany - with Europa League knockout football also on the horizon.",
      "Ward-Prowse continued: \"Everyone is playing for a place at the Euros, it's in the back of their minds. Kalvin will feel he has got a point to prove and equally, so do I.",
      "\"It's good healthy competition and while we are both in a West Ham shirt we will do what we can to help this team and make it a successful season.\"",
      "West Ham's inspired £30million summer signing conceded in November that an international call-up was not on his radar following Gareth Southgate's latest brutal snub.",
      "You get the sense Ward-Prowse has become disillusioned by his repeated omissions after he narrowly missed out on England's World Cup squad for Qatar in 2022. However, his frustrations have had no impact on his form at club level as he continues to drive the standards both on and off the field.",
      "The biggest compliment you can pay him is that he already looks like part of the furniture at West Ham less than six months after ending his 20-year stay with Southampton.",
      "He concluded: \"The England manager has got his players and the way he likes to play and that's his decision. I can only talk about my experience playing with Kalvin and you can see his quality on the ball and the way he can move it well. He's also got great character.\""

      "Speaking of young centre-backs, Branthwaite is a little older than Scalvini at 21 but would come with Premier League experience. The England under-21 international has impressed at the back for Everton this term, while also got regular top-flight football last season under Ruud van Nistelrooy at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "United were among several clubs linked with a January swoop for the ex-Carlisle man, with some reports suggesting he might set them back around £40m. Whether that fee remains the same come June, with question marks over Everton's need to cash in, remains in the balance.",
      "\"I think when all of those clubs are interested and watching your games, it's gonna be one of them where you take notice,\" Branthwaite exclusively told Mirror Football in May amid reports of interest from United and Roma. Since then, though, Sean Dyche has shown he sees him as a key player and Everton are unlikely to let him leave without a fight.",
      "Benfica star Neves was another mentioned in connection with United in January, only for his club to firmly deny any talks had begun. \"Sport Lisboa e Benfica denies the existence of any right of preference over its player João Neves,\" the Portuguese giants said.",
      "\"Under no circumstances did Sport Lisboa e Benfica enter into talks with Manchester United or any other club about this player from their formation – nor does it intend to do so – so any information that points in another direction is false,\" the statement continued. Based on Neves' form, though, links can hardly be considered a surprise.",
      "The 19-year-old has played 19 league games this season, scoring once from his defensive midfield berth. He also didn't miss a minute in the Champions League as Benfica finished third in their group behind Real Sociedad and Internazionale.",
      "Erik ten Hag admitted Financial Fair Play concerns stood in the way of United adding another striker in January. Anthony Martial's injury saw the club explore what might be possible, and the Frenchman could well leave in the summer to leave a gap.",
      "There are several candidates to fill that gap, and Brighton striker Ferguson is among them. If Ten Hag wants young talent, the Irishman - who scored his first Premier League hat-trick earlier this season - certainly ticks the boxes.",
      "Ferguson signed a new long-term contract with Brighton in 2023, so any hopes of a cut-price deal might be far-fetched. Still, the Irish international would be seen as an investment for now and in the future, similar to summer signing Hojlund.",
      "On the subject of FFP, another team unable to spent in January was Newcastle United. Indeed, Eddie Howe's men may need to sell before they can buy, with Bruno Guimaraes already being linked with some of the Premier League's big hitters.",
      "The Brazilian's quality is evident, as is his ability to cut it in the Premier League. Newcastle won't want to sell one of their key men, but there have been suggestions they might have little choice.",
      "Of course, United themselves might need to find takers for some of their current squad members to fit in a swoop. If Casemiro's Saudi Pro League links bear fruit, though, then fans may well dare to dream."

      "In the absence of deadline day signings, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund set Ten Hag's side up for victory as both netted in United's win. However, both players had been substituted when United were in search of a goal after a dramatic Wolves comeback saw the teams level after 95 minutes.",
      "Omari Forson, 19, was brought on to replace Hojlund and the midfielder provided the assist for fellow youth prospect Kobbie Mainoo to produce a 97th-minute winner. With the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules seeing a careful approach to the window, Ten Hag will need to hope similar combinations can continue to come up trumps to provide depth.",

That was not enough to provide room for the club to manoeuvre after significant spending in the summer.",

And although the current crop are not yet rivals to the Class of 92’s David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and the Neville brothers, they have produced the goods where too many of Ten Hag’s expensive recruits have been poor.",
      "Throwing another £100million at the transfer market does not always solve a big club’s problems on the pitch. Sometimes the answer lies closer to home – and Manchester United’s academy has always been a special nursery for young talent.",

It’s great to see two of our biggest clubs keeping their conveyor belts of scouted young talent in good order.‌",

In the same way that a Mark Robins goal at Nottingham Forest was reputed to rescue Sir Alex Ferguson from the sack in 1990, they may even save his job.",

      "At the start of the season, Gary Neville claimed Erik ten Hag was trying to force Scott McTominay out of Manchester United - six months later he's leading the Red Devils scoring charts",
      "Gary Neville's early season assessment of Scott McTominay's  Manchester United prospects have not aged well six months down the line.",
      "Back in August, after the Scotland international was an unused substitute for the 2-0 defeat away at Tottenham, United legend Neville clearly feared for McTominay's future at Old Trafford. In fairness, he wasn't the only one left confused by Ten Hag's decision to leave the midfielder on the bench when it seemed clear that someone of his profile was required.",
      "However, the Dutchman clearly disagreed, prompting Neville to make the bold claim that the United boss wants rid of McTominay. He told Sky Sports: \"What's clear is that Manchester United's midfield needs bolstering.",
      "\"Ten Hag wants a number six who can play alongside Casemiro and, at the moment, the club can't get players out to be able to fund that. If they look at the first two weeks, they have to fund it or there will be a big problem. What is clear is that Ten Hag doesn't want to revert back to Scott McTominay.",
      "\"With Fernandes on the right, the midfield looks all over the place and the front three doesn't look capable of functioning as one. Does he go back to McTominay? Ten Hag has made five substitutions and not used him. It's almost as if he is managing him out of the club.\"",
      "Fast forward to February and McTominay is as integral to the United cause as he has ever been. The 27-year-old is the club's leading goalscorer in the league so far with six strikes to his name, including a vital header late on during the 4-3 win over Wolves on Thursday.",
      "McTominay's clearly loving life under Ten Hag's guidance, recently singing his praises on the High Performance Podcast. The United ace explained: \"He's an amazing manager with great tactical dimensions to his game. Some of the things he says and how he conducts his meetings are brilliant and I just want to be a part of that.\"",
      "The feeling is mutual judging by the manager's recent remarks. After handing the Scotsman the armband at Anfield, the United boss said: \"I think he is one of the examples of what it means to play for Manchester United, to play with the badge on his heart.",
      "\"He is an example, and the others cantake thatand build on him. I'm sure he will be a communicator; I'm sure he will be an example of passion and desire, and you need that in these games.\""

      "An expert lip reader has claimed Jude Bellingham DID call Mason Greenwood 'a rapist' during Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Getafe on Thursday night.",
      "The incident in question took place after Bellingham tackled the Manchester United loanee near the touchline. Having caught Greenwood in possession and clearing the ball out for a throw in, television cameras showed the Real Madrid superstar mutter something in the direction of Greenwood, but there was no audio to confirm what was said.",
      "Following the full-time whistle, Spanish publication Cadena SER reported that Getafe have requested for Bellingham's alleged comment to be included in the referee's official match report and approached the La Liga delegate who was in attendance.",
      "While analysing the clip, expert lip-reader Jeremy Freeman has exclusively told Mirror Football: \"Upon a forensic examination of the provided clip, I am very confident that the word articulated is 'rapist'. This conclusion is strongly influenced by the specific context in which the word was used.",
      "\"The lip movements distinctly form the sounds corresponding to 'R' and 'P', concluding with an abrupt stop, which aligns with the word in question. The speaker's accent, which appears to be distinctly Brummie, has also been taken into consideration in making this determination.",
      "\"Considering the visual evidence and the lack of any other word fitting the observed lip patterns and context, I am confident in this assessment.\"",
      "If La Liga judge Bellingham to have said the word to Greenwood, the former Birmingham and Borussia Dortmund ace could be handed a significant punishment by league officials.",
      "Previously, Greenwood had been charged with attempted rape, assault, and coercive behaviour in January 2022 but charges were eventually dropped in February of last year by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "Following an internal investigation by parent club United, Greenwood was sent out on loan to Getafe and is expected to leave the Red Devils permanently in the future. Rumours that the United academy graduate could potentially return to the first-team fold before his switch to Getafa sparked a huge backlash.",
      "Since his arrival in Spain, Greenwood has bagged six goals in 21 appearances for Getafe, as well as registering four assists across all competitions. The Spanish outfit currently sit 10th in the La Liga table."

      "He also addressed the lack of January signings, underlining a need to not ‘waste money’ in an uncooperative market.",
      "In a confounding series of permutations, United didn’t progress through to the Conti Cup group stages following a decision to dock Aston Villa three points after the club fielded an ineligible player in Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 victory over Sunderland in the final group stage match.",
      "With Maritz having already competed in the competition with Arsenal earlier in the season on three separate occasions, Villa were found in contravention of competition regulations.",
      "However, rather than expelling Villa from the competition as Reading were 10 years ago for the same breach, an independent tribunal ordered Villa to forfeit their three points to Sunderland but issued no further sanctions.",
      "Villa subsequently progressed through to the quarter-finals as group runners-up behind Sunderland, alongside fellow WSL club Tottenham Hotspur, while United were denied passage based on points-per-game.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the decision, Skinner said: \"I don't believe there's scope to challenge it. It's obviously disappointing but it's something you have to take. I don't believe we have the opportunity to have any input in it because we aren’t a team involved within that game. That's all we know.”",
      "He added: \"We're disappointed to be out but we will move on very quickly. I think it might inform future rules on the competition, but right here, right now, we're out. We have to move on.”",
      "United made no new signings during the January transfer window despite Skinner’s plea to ownership that recruits were needed to bridge the gap to the league’s top three. United, who were one of the biggest spenders in the summer, currently sit 10 points off leaders Chelsea and seven points off Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Addressing the dearth in incomings, Skinner said: “We always said, it's about bringing the right people in. The team will not spend money that we waste, we don't want to waste money.",
      "“It's about the right people. We don't need to just put people in for the sake of numbers, we never will do that. From our perspective, we're very lasered in on the type of player we need at Manchester United. We're continuing to work on that even when the window shuts. The window is just the moment you reveal your work. We're working behind the scenes every single day.\""

      "In his own words, he ‘is fighting for food for my family and friends.’ It doesn’t necessarily follow that he routinely wields a meat cleaver - but still… most Manchester United fans would understand the sentiment behind it.",

      "But if there’s one reason why Erik ten Hag’s progress has stalled since the heady days of last year, then Martinez’s lengthy absence from a foot injury helps explain it.",
      "You need someone who will treat every game as if it's his last and takes it personally when the opposition has a shot at goal - never mind score one. For too long that edge has been lacking at the heart of the Dutchman’s defence.",
      "But other factors make the South American such a key feature of the success ten Hag enjoyed. For a start, his passing ability and calmness - not just when in possession - is a vital ingredient of any successful side.",
      "And while his detractors will point to the five feet nine inches he stands and say this is too small to be effective in the Premier League, it overlooks other key qualities. It happened again on Thursday night.",
      "Manchester United, two goals up, looking like they would net every time they went forward, then left the door unlocked at the back just after the break. Wolves’ skipper Max Kilman met a free-kick with Andre Onana in no man's land - and one man gambled to prevent the ball from hitting the net.",

      "Fortunately for Erik ten Hag and co, Mainoo was able to find a moment of magic to restore United's lead in a game they should already have had sewn up.

We’ve shown this season that we can compete with the biggest teams, so we’ll go there confident we can show what we’re made of.",

He was within his rights to stand by that argument based on Thursday night's evidence. Of course, the challenge for United now is to prove that Thursday night's showing was not a flash in the pan. False dawns have been a far too familiar theme this season. They must prove that the performance they produced at Molineux can be replicated week after week.",

      "Man Utd youngster Kobbie Mainoo is making exceptional progress and he's already been likened to Paul Pogba.",
      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",
      "Pogba left on a free transfer to join Juventus in the summer of 2012 after failing to agree a new contract when it might have been advisable to build a team around him.",
      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",
      "His potential is frightening and a new star from Carrington has been born. He could be everything Pogba was supposed to be for United.",

      "Man Utd will look to sign a couple of forwards in the summer transfer window, and Rasmus Hojlund could influence those plans.",
      "Erik ten Hag admits he wanted to sign another striker in the January transfer window. Rasmus Hojlund is at least easing those concerns for now.",
      "The Danish forward took a while to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League, but now he looks right at home with goals in three successive matches.",
      "What is most pleasing is that the last two goals in particular have been typical predatory finishes, with Hojlund in the right place at the right time to bundle the ball in from close range. He won't get much credit for those goals, but they are exactly the type United haven't been scoring in recent years.",
      "OPINION: Mainoo has done something no other player has done under Ten Hag",
      "Hojlund has also suffered from a lack of consistent support from his teammates so far this season, and it is no surprise his output has picked up at a time when a number of key players returned to the squad. His goal at Wolves, for example, would not have been possible without Luke Shaw in the side.",
      "There is real excitement surrounding Hojlund at the moment, and there is real intrigue about how good he can become after such a promising run of form. Although the answer may intrigue supporters, the club's transfer committee is in dire need of finding it before the summer transfer market opens.",
      "United are in the market for at least two forwards this summer, with Anthony Martial, Jadon Sancho, and Mason Greenwood all set to leave. Facundo Pellistri could also be sold, and Amad might need another loan move too. The jury is also very much out on Antony.",
      "Hojlund's form in the closing months of the season will influence the type of striker United look to add to their squad, as they consider both short-term solutions and long-term additions.",
      "There is still an argument United need another experienced option to help ease the burden on Hojlund, though signing a player currently in their prime would not be good for the player's development.",
      "Likewise, there is also a danger of signing another relatively inexperienced and raw striker, because it could be doubling their problem rather than halving it. This would also cause the issue of trying to develop two players at the same time, something that can't really be done when they only play with one central attacker.",
      "In an ideal world, United would add another experienced option in the same mould as previous signings Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Edinson Cavani this summer, though perhaps one who is slightly younger than those two were when they arrived, respectively.",
      "This would give United a viable alternative to Hojlund in the forward line, but at the same time, they would not have to promise them a key role and regular starts either.",
      "It seems like the best plan for United to reinforce their options this summer, yet in order for it to work, it relies on the Danish forward maintaining his recent level of improvement until the end of the campaign.",
      "Based on what we have seen in recent weeks, it certainly seems a possibility, and with the United side replenished by so many returning players, he finally has the service he has been missing for so long.",
      "Hojlund doesn't need replacing; he needs support.",

      "The feel-good story in a bad season thus far for Man United is Kobbie Mainoo, who could help them have a successful run-in.",
      "The Manchester United football director John Murtough was struggling for the appropriate word to summarise what he had just witnessed as he wandered up and down the tunnel at Molineux.",
      "United have registered two 97th-minute winners this season, three victories have been secured beyond the 90th minute, they have recovered from 2-0 down to win 3-2 twice and all but four of their triumphs have been won by one goal. Even in a season where United's goal difference is still in minus numbers, there has been more drama than in a West End play.",
      "When Erik ten Hag was almost on his knees against Brentford, Scott McTominay stood tall. Rasmus Hojlund was hunched over a seat and shaking his head in the dugout on Thursday night. Seconds later, he leapt into the arms of Harry Maguire.",
      "As much as United strive to win games as comfortably as possible, winning in the manner that they did at Wolves is the best feeling in sport, never mind football. Kobbie Mainoo, at the age of 18, has followed in the footsteps of Steve Bruce, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Paul Scholes et al. The good and the great have extended the legacy of Fergie Time.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson smiled broadly as the United away-dayers were kept at bay in the Steve Bull Stand. The incumbent United manager showed reasonable restraint as Mainoo jogged towards the moshpit on the far side.",
      "Ten Hag was not the only one. Maguire eschewed the celebrations and pointed to his temple. United had folded at 3-1 and there was still time on the clock. That was on Ten Hag's mind at his post-match press conference.",
      "\"To be honest, I had mixed feelings\" were Ten Hag's first words. He was vexed that United's performance had been undermined by preventable goals when they ought to have ended the night with their goal difference back in the positives.",
      "Ten Hag has not been as strident in his criticism of United when they have won this season and he was perhaps emboldened by the sight of his strongest XI on the pitch in his 94th match in charge. United neared the standards they set last season.",
      "Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez rekindled their Latino alliance in defence, celebrating blocks, tackles and goal kicks. Casemiro was serenaded louder than ever this season, Marcus Rashford's finish had the finesse of some of his clinical strikes last season and United scored four goals in a Premier League match for only the second time under Ten Hag.",
      "Ten Hag's constructive criticism in victory was a recurring theme in a successful 2022-23 campaign. \"Good is not good enough\" was his maxim. That has seldom been heard this season.",
      "Those five words neatly summarised United at Wolves. The first half was their best 45 minutes of the season. Ten Hag argued the performance level extended to an hour. And still United squandered two two-goal leads and sieved three goals in 24 minutes.",
      "It happened in Copenhagen and Istanbul. Mainoo did not start in either of those Champions League ties and, as raw as the 18-year-old is, United would have been in a better place had he avoided that deflating ankle injury in Houston against Real Madrid back in July. Mainoo is a diamond already sharp around the edges.",
      "He is the feel-good story of a bad season thus far for United. It is just as well a Stockport-born academy graduate who still lives with his parents and switches his engine off in the main car park at Carrington has emerged as the long-term linchpin of United's midfield.",
      "That was supposed to be Mason Mount, a £60million signing who has made nine starts in the last year and completed 90 minutes once. When Ten Hag was asked about Mount at Molineux, he spoke with a sombre tone that suggested United matchgoers could go another month without seeing him.",
      "\"He was struggling from the second game of the season,\" Ten Hag said. \"He returned for a period and then picked up another injury, so of course that’s not great.",
      "\"That is very frustrating for him and I really feel for him. I really want to be there for him because he had such high expectations and I had high expectations.\"",
      "Ten Hag added that \"by the end of the season he can stay fit and fight his way into the team, or at least play a role in his team\". The terrible troika of Michael Owen, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez made a quicker impression than the current United number seven.",
      "This season may well be a write-off for Mount, who had entered the last year of his contract at Chelsea. United have invested £60m to primarily foot his medical bills. Mount has been sidelined for a combined four months as a United player come next week.",
      "Mount was always a dubious choice to pair with Casemiro. In hindsight, United should have invested completely in Mainoo's development, deferred a midfield recruit for another year and put the £60m towards Harry Kane. Easier said than done and the consensus this time last year was United required a dynamic midfielder. Mount never fit that bill but Mainoo does.",
      "The theory that a player's reputation grows when they are out does not hold up with Mount. He struggled so much in his seven starts that no supporter or reporter has lamented his absence. Mainoo's was.",
      "He has already left Murtough speechless.",

      "He is one of many United academy graduates to have made their debut under Erik ten Hag with the likes of Dan Gore, Omari Forson and Willy Kambwala all making their first-team bow this season.",
      "Mainoo made his 60-minute debut almost 13 months ago and has flourished ever since, despite suffering a long-term ankle injury in pre-season. Hojlund is thankful to have the teenager in his side and says the squad’s breakthrough stars have made sure to keep in touch with one another away from the pitch.",
      "“We enjoy spending time together,” £72m summer signing Hojlund said, as per the Mirror. “The young guys have a little group where we're chatting to each other and it's very cool to have other young players around the team.",
      "“Hopefully we can set an era for the club and be here many years together. If you're good enough, you're old enough and I think that's a good thing. We're here for a reason.”",
      "On Mainoo, he added: “You can see Kobbie’s composure. He is so relaxed on the ball. Now he's also starting to show that he has the scoring parts of his game as well. He's a complete player.”",
      "Hojlund’s 22nd-minute goal at Molineux took his season tally to nine, of which three have come in the Premier League. The Dane did not get his first goal in the competition until Boxing Day but says his first strike has given him the confidence to score more.",
      "“Of course, if you asked me, I would have loved to score my first goal in September or October,” he added. “I knew I could score goals. I had shown it in the Champions League and at my previous clubs.",
      "“But, of course, opening the account means it’s like ‘Okay, I can do it’. It’s good to see. I hope we can keep going, keep the confidence in the team and keep providing for each other. I think that’s the key. We’re all being selfish when we have to but we also play for each other.”",

      "Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo played alongside each other for the first time in the Premier League when Man Utd overcame Wolves in their seven-goal thriller at Molineux",
      "Manchester United have splashed out £400million-plus since Erik ten Hag stepped into their dugout last summer. However, perhaps his most important and transformative addition to the first-team squad is one that didn't cost a penny.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the star that continues to rise at Old Trafford and beyond. There have been many false dawns in those barren post-Sir Alex Ferguson years - not to mention so much doom and gloom - but there are finally one or two shining lights at the end of the proverbial tunnel.",
      "After watching Alejandro Garnacho take his first steps last season, Mainoo - another supremely talented academy graduate - has followed his path this campaign. The Stockport-born teenager remains a Premier League rookie and yet eight games into his senior career has become almost undroppable.",
      "In doing so, the midfielder has helped United solve a transfer question Gary Neville asked this summer. Ultimately, though, the former captain turned TV pundit was not the only one to hold such concern.",
      "United must not heap too much pressure on him - or Garnacho for that matter - but match-goers understand that better than anyone. Instead, they can revel in two no-longer-hidden gems who could well provide the cornerstone for the club to turn things around on the pitch.",
      "Had things gone to plan, Mainoo would have been unleashed at an earlier juncture. Injury delayed his bow and by the time he made his mark on debut against Everton and other pre-Christmas games, Casemiro was unfortunately consigned to the Carrington treatment table himself.",
      "The fit-again Brazilian powerhouse returned against Wolves and - over his 73-minute outing - United were able to address Neville and do something they too have been longing to do. The present and future combined in their engine room for the very first time.",
      "Problems for United in midfield are long-standing. Ten Hag failed in his, at times, garishly public pursuit for Frenkie de Jong two summers ago, leading him to snap up an ageing Casemiro for £60million from Real Madrid in addition to four other players - including two loan deals - in that same position.",
      "Casemiro was not the player United wanted last season. However, the 31-year-old was a better fit for the squad at that time, protecting the back four virtually on his own.",
      "Question marks around his early-season form this campaign highlighted that United needed to make yet another move in that position. However, amid uncertainty and a lack of further conviction in the transfer market, a genuine and forward-thinking answer was right there in their own famed academy system.",
      "\"Casemiro looks lost in midfield in these first two matches,\" said Neville in August. \"What's clear is that Manchester United's midfield needs bolstering. Ten Hag wants a No.6 who can play alongside Casemiro and at the moment the club can't get players out to fund that.\"",
      "Although the club were proactive in sanctioning outgoings during the January transfer window, it was not overly necessary to create that pathway for Mainoo. He carved that out for himself by catching the eye in training and in matches while standing in for Casemiro over the winter.",
      "They can now continue to be unleashed together.",
      "\"It was impressive and there's no point getting carried away because the reality is he's got 17 or 18 years in front of him and a lot of work to do,\" said Neville after Mainoo wowed on debut. \"I always judge players when it's the most difficult part of the game and when Man United had their most difficult period in that first half I thought he was the only player who showed up, the only player who still looked like himself.",
      "\"The biggest compliment that I can pay him - and it hurts to say and I hope people can take that in the right spirit - he looked like a Manchester City player. I was thinking that's a player Pep Guardiola will be looking at and thinking; 'I want him in my midfield, that's what my midfield players do'.\"",
      "United will take a rare (recent) win on City by holding up Mainoo as a poster boy for a brighter future. His ongoing emergence has also helped them atone for some glaring misses in the transfer market.",

      "The academy graduate celebrated his 20th birthday on Friday and is now at an awkward crossroads where he is untested at youth level and needs to be playing regular football at senior level.",
      "Shoretire made his first-team debut at the age of just 17 and still holds the record as the youngest player to represent United in European competition. However, he has struggled to build upon that early promise and has been overtaken in the pecking order by other academy graduates.",
      "LATEST: £150m trio to be removed from Premier League squad after January transfer window",
      "He has trained with the first team consistently in recent weeks and more often than he has at any other point of the season. Yet he has been overlooked.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was the match winner in midweek, a goal that was set up by fellow academy product Omari Forson. They, along with Alejandro Garancho, are the hottest young talents at the club, while Willy Kambwala has also been given opportunities this season.",
      "Shoretire's struggles are a reminder of the cutthroat nature of academy football. A homegrown talent at a club like United is the next best thing until another soon emerges to take their place.",
      "Erik ten Hag has taken on a more hands-on approach with the academy since he joined the club, having felt the U21s were 'isolated' before his arrival. He now takes an active role in deciding which youngsters train with the first team and has set the challenge for at least one youth team player to become part of the first team during every season he's at the club.",
      "The United manager won't give youngsters an opportunity just to keep up traditions, and he has made it clear that only the very best youth prospects will be given a chance in the senior set-up. Mainoo and Garnacho fit the criteria as elite talents; Shoretire should not be ashamed that he doesn't quite fit that bracket anymore.",
      "United are in preliminary talks with Shoretire over a new contract and still hope he agrees to new terms, as they look to protect his value in the increasingly likely scenario where he is sold in the coming years. A loan move was mooted in the January transfer window but never materialised.",
      "While the primary task of the club's illustrious academy is to produce talent for the first team, United also accept that it can be a money-making machine. With current Financial Fair Play rules, it is hugely beneficial to a club to sell homegrown players because the profit on the sale is purely classified as income.",
      "Isak Hansen-Aarøen was sold on deadline day, while Hannibal Mejbri moved to Sevilla on an initial loan with the option of a permanent sale, and Alvaro Fernandez left in a similar deal to join Benfica. Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado were all allowed to leave last summer.",
      "It would make sense if Shoretire was one of the next to join them in exiting the club. He has shone brightly at times, but now it looks to be in the interest of all parties if he were moved on too.",
      "The academy not only makes world-class talent, it makes money as well.",

      "The latest transfer rumours from Old Trafford involving Bruno Fernandes and AC Milan superstar Rafael Leao",
      "Bruno Fernandes rejected a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal during the January transfer window, according to reports, as the Manchester United captain pledged his future to the club while rebuffing his chance to team up with Brazil superstar Neymar in the Gulf state.",
      "Fernandes, 29, signed for United in January 2020 and can be regarded among the best players in Europe. However, while trophies have been at a premium for the playmaker during his Old Trafford career, he has opted to stay put and spearhead their push to recapture former glories.",
      "Reports from Portuguese publication Record flag up interest from Al-Hilal and indicate the Saudi Pro League club made every attempt to sign him last month. Al-Hilal are managed by Jorge Jesus - who worked with Fernandes at Sporting Lisbon before his switch to United.",
      "Despite a heavy-handed attempt to bring Fernandes to the Gulf state, though, the 63-cap international is thought to have turned down that 'pharaonic proposal' to stay. The ex-Sampdoria playmaker is said to be keen on doing his utmost to ensure he wins further silverware at United after lifting the Carabao Cup last season.",
      "Fernandes is understood to have turned down numbers that might have been 'irrefutable' to most. He would have also had the opportunity to play alongside Neymar in his twilight years.",
      "Elsewhere, reports from Caught Offside suggest United are braced for competition from PSG and Manchester City in their mooted pursuit to snap up Raphael Leao next summer. The highly-rated AC Milan forward is claimed to have a release clause worth a staggering €175million, though any move would surely depend on whether a lower fee could be negotiated.",
      "Leao, 24, has only scored six goals in 26 outings this season. However, his overall record for the Italian giants reads 49 goals and 42 assists from 189 matches.",
      "He has been earmarked as a possible replacement for Kylian Mbappe on the proviso that the Frenchman signs for Real Madrid. Leao remains under contract at the San Siro until 2028.",

      "United, who were beaten 2-0 by the Hammers in December, recorded their first Premier League win of 2024 on Thursday evening in dramatic fashion, beating Wolves 4-3 at Molineux. Kobbie Mainoo netted a last-gasp winner to seal a fully-deserved victory.",
      "Though United, in the end, made hard work of their triumph at Molineux, they produced some of the best football they have played all season. It means manager Erik ten Hag, who has won two of his previous four meetings with the Hammers, may refrain from tinkering with his XI.",
      "With that said, Andre Onana, who was thrown straight back into the starting line-up on Thursday night after an underwhelming Africa Cup of Nations campaign, is likely to retain his place in goal. He has started each of United's opening 22 Premier League matches this season.",
      "As for the back four, it should remain unchanged, provided Lisandro Martinez's injury is nothing too serious. He was taken off as a precaution in the latter stages at Molineux and was spotted with ice strapped around his foot.",

      "The summer of 2024 will be a critical one in taking Man United to the next stage of their development.",
      "When it comes to the task of selecting his starting line-up for Sunday's clash with West Ham United, Erik ten Hag ought not to encounter too many difficulties.",
      "Thursday night's 4-3 win over Wolves felt as though it could prove to be a significant juncture in Manchester United's season. After throwing away a lead in stoppage time, Kobbie Mainoo spared United's blushes with a moment of individual brilliance.",
      "In an arena that features golden seats, United's golden boy injected fresh energy into their season, finding the back of the net with a goal that will be spoken about for years to come. Though the 4-3 scoreline suggested United had edged an even contest, it was anything but.",
      "United, particularly in the first half, produced their most polished performance of the season. Some may go as far as saying the football on show in the first 45 minutes was the best they have produced under Ten Hag.",
      "Though it featured a familiar flaw in the form of missed chances, United's first-half showing in the Black Country, which saw them head into the half-time interval with a two-goal lead, was superb. Featuring a clear identity, energy and hunger, United, with more composure, would have been home and dry.",
      "Lisandro Martinez added organisation and his ball-playing credentials to the back-four. Luke Shaw added an extra attacking threat from left-back. Marcus Rashford, recalled after a disciplinary issue, caused havoc down the left. Rasmus Hojlund led the line with maturity. Mainoo, as ever, oozed class in midfield.",
      "Everything that could have gone right in the first half did go right. Defensive flaws crept in after the break, particularly in the manner in which United conceded for a third time, but everything else was on point.",
      "Ten Hag had quipped for several weeks that he expected United to get back to their best once their injury crisis had eased and the likes of Martinez, Shaw and Casemiro returned. He was within his rights to stand by that argument based on Thursday night's evidence.",
      "Of course, the challenge for United now is to prove that Thursday night's showing was not a flash in the pan. False dawns have been a far too familiar theme this season. They must prove that the performance they produced at Molineux can be replicated week after week.",
      "For many, United now have the ingredients available to them to find some much-needed consistency, following the returns of the likes of Martinez and Shaw, who are both critical to the way Ten Hag wants his team to play. With those two available, the Dutchman now has a crop of players available to him that help form the strongest XI currently at the club.",
      "The XI Ten Hag deployed at Molineux is United's strongest currently. It featured a goalkeeper of Ten Hag's choice, a ball-playing centre-back, a midfielder with enormous potential, one of the most accomplished attacking midfielders in the world, an exciting winger and a £72million striker.",
      "This forthcoming summer will mark the next stage of Ten Hag's gradual rebuild, meaning further additions are expected. With INEOS overseeing recruitment, it is hoped that United will be wise in their thinking and not repeat any mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "It is understood that United have provisionally drawn up a list of four positions they wish to strengthen next season: right-back, centre-back, central-midfield and up front. Of the XI that started at Molineux, you can argue upgrades, for the long-term, are needed at right-back, centre-back and in defensive-midfield.",
      "Diogo Dalot has frequently contested the right-back spot with Aaron Wan-Bissaka over the past 12 months, with Ten Hag failing to settle on a first-choice option. Raphael Varane's fitness is unreliable, meaning United need to source a long-term partner for Martinez. Casemiro turns 32 later this month and is, it is felt, past his peak.",
      "Should Ten Hag receive strong financial backing from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, finding a new right-back, a centre-back and a replacement for Casemiro should be United's three main objectives this summer. They must also find someone to provide competition and back-up for Hojlund.",
      "Those three starting positions aside, United have a cluster of players capable of taking the club forward. The left-wing may come under scrutiny, too, but it shouldn't if Rashford performs at his best consistently.",
      "United will, of course, need to add strength in depth this summer, certainly within reason, but three statement signings to go into the first XI could be enough. It is now down to United's existing players to prove it.",

      "It is only right that Kobbie Mainoo is hailed as the hero after his sensational stoppage-time winner at Molineux on Thursday night. After all, he produced the decisive moment to end a dramatic match in which Manchester United were almost as bad as they were good.",
      "He wasn't the only United player who made a huge difference. Mainoo might be the one who adorns the back pages, but further inside, there deserves to be a special mention for Luke Shaw, a player who lifted United again.",
      "The 28-year-old caught the eye with his industrious performance against Newport at the weekend, but the real test was always going to be his first Premier League since before Christmas.",
      "Shaw has been short of match sharpness since that latest injury lay-off, yet he still lasted the entire 100 minutes at Molineux, offering a constant threat down the left wing.",
      "His partnership with Marcus Rashford is one of the most unsung in the Premier League and whenever anyone mentions the forward's remarkable 30-goal haul last season, it is important to note his support in making it happen.",
      "It is obvious Rashford has seen a clear drop-off in this season compared with last, but it is important to note Shaw's absences as a key factor in that. Shaw only missed eight matches across their mammoth 62-match campaign last season. He has missed 20 games so far this season.",
      "A key part of Rashford's game is running at isolated full-backs and exploiting the space in the channels so that he can cut inside onto his dominant foot. It can be infuriating at times and at others, it can be inspirational. However, for it to work, he needs the support of a left-back who can both underlap and overlap, draw defenders out of position and be available to exchange passes.",
      "This was no more apparent than with United's second goal of the night, when Rashford controlled the ball on the edge of the Wolves box and within seconds Shaw ran behind him to create an overload on the left wing.",
      "Shaw timed his run to perfection, reading the game so well that he was able to play a first-time cross into the near post straight into the path of Rasmus Hojlund, rather than taking a touch that would have killed momentum and meant the striker had to make another run inside the box.",
      "The left-back won't get much credit for the assist because it looked so simple. That in itself is the biggest compliment you can pay to a player who doesn't overcomplicate things.",
      "It is true that his positioning wasn't great when Wolves finally drew things level deep in injury time, though he wasn't the only United player exposed when Antony inexcusably lost the ball at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Further improvement will be required from both individuals and United as a collective in the weeks ahead, with Shaw one of those who should get even better once he has a run of games under his belt. If all goes well, he will soon be one of the first names on the teamsheet again, a player who is almost taken for granted due to his reliability and monopoly on a starting role.",
      "Mainoo deserves to dominate the headlines. Shaw deserves to be recognised for his supporting role.",

      "The 25-year-old sustained a hamstring injury in the second game of the season at Tottenham and missed the next four matches. Mount suffered a calf injury in training in November but resumed outdoor training in late December and Ten Hag hoped to have him back in January.",
      "However, Mount has resorted to indoor training and could miss the majority of United's fixtures in February. The England international did not start in any of Chelsea's last 18 matches of the 2022-23 campaign due to a pubis injury and he has started nine games in the last year, completing 90 minutes only once.",
      "\"He was struggling from the second game of the season,\" Ten Hag said. \"He returned for a period and then picked up another injury, so of course that’s not great.",
      "\"That is very frustrating for him and I really feel for him. I really want to be there for him because he had such high expectations and I had high expectations.",
      "\"I am sure he is a very good player for us. But, first of all, what’s now important is we have to do it very secure to get him fit. Secure in the process, step by step, don’t force it and then hopefully by the end of the season he can stay fit and fight his way into the team, or at least play a role in his team.",
      "\"Absolutely, I expect him to return (before the end of the season).\"",

      "Ratcliffe's bid of around £1.25billion was made official before Christmas and Joel and Avram Glazer released a joint statement in which they said they were 'delighted' with the deal. The Americans also reiterated their commitment to 'delivering success' at the club.",

Applications will be accepted from existing season ticket holders, with 500 seats reserved for fans aged 16-25 through special youth season tickets priced at £16 per game.",
      "United fan group The Red Army (TRA) is to be moved behind the goal in former executive seats, seeing an increase from 1,800 to 2,700 allocated seats. The decision to increase ticket prices comes just weeks after Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired shares in the side, with his minority takeover still awaiting Premier League ratification.

      "The report also claims that Chelsea and Newcastle United were approached by the striker's entourage. Wolves had been linked with Haller on deadline day, as were Fulham, who eventually signed Armando Broja from the Stamford Bridge club on loan.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Man United recorded their first Premier League win of 2024 on Thursday night, beating Wolves 4-3 at Molineux, but it must mark a turning point in their season.",
      "As a flurry of Manchester United supporters started to vacate their golden seats at Molineux, their golden boy forced them to come running back.",
      "With 97 minutes on the clock, Kobbie Mainoo could not have selected a better moment to score his first-ever Premier League goal. Pedro Neto's 95th-minute equaliser had, it seemed, earned Wolves a point, denying United a win that would have been fully merited.",
      "But as United's supporters prepared to criticise those all too familiar failings, such as wasted opportunities and their soft underbelly, Mainoo changed the mindset with a moment of individual brilliance. After dodging two challenges, he entered the penalty area, bent a right-footed effort towards the far corner and sent the away end barmy.",
      "United, to their credit, had produced some of the best football they had played all season, particularly in the first half. They looked menacing every time they went forward, with full-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw providing forward runs to support Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who netted the second goal as a result of one of Shaw's darts to the byline, was everywhere, chasing every ball and providing a focal point at the top end of the pitch for United to aim at. His combination play with Rashford and Garnacho, as well as Bruno Fernandes, suggests Ten Hag, just as he did against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, has discovered his best trio in attack to unleash United's potential.",
      "When Ten Hag deployed a front-three of Garnacho, Hojlund and Rashford against Villa, United scored three times, staging a brilliant second-half comeback at Old Trafford. On this occasion, United went one better and scored four for the second game running, following last weekend's dispatching of Newport County in the FA Cup at Rodney Parade.",
      "Though only two members of the front-three got on the scoresheet at Molineux, the second-half contributions of Scott McTominay, who put United 3-1 up less than two minutes after coming off the bench, and Mainoo meant United plundered four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since February 2022 - a 4-2 win over Leeds United at Elland Road under Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Scoring goals by the bucketload has been a problem for United throughout Ten Hag's tenure, highlighted by this season's tally of just 28 in 22 league matches. They have only scored four goals on two occasions in the Premier League under the Dutchman's stewardship.",
      "Nevertheless, though United's soft centre very nearly meant they exited the Black Country with just a point, they did, in the end, secure all three, which their performance so richly deserved. Their first-half showing was their best in a very long time.",
      "After a stop-start January, which featured just one league game, February offers United the opportunity to put together a run of positive results in their bid to climb the table. They are still outsiders to finish in the top four, currently finding themselves eight points shy of Tottenham Hotspur, but the landscape of the Premier League standings can change quickly with a few good results.",
      "Of course, United have been guilty of too many false dawns this season; they followed up a 2-1 win over Chelsea with a 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth three days later in December. This time around, perhaps because of the returns of Lisandro Martinez, Shaw and Casemiro, it feels different.",
      "There was an identity to United's play at Molineux and it translated into scoring four goals in a Premier League game for the first time since May, and the first time in a Premier League away game in two years. Their attack, particularly in the first half, looked menacing, with Rashford hungry to prove a point after last week's off-field events, Hojlund producing a polished performance and Garnacho once again highlighting why he is a better fit on the right wing than Antony.",
      "If United's performance at Molineux was a sign that everything is about to click into place, they need to prove it. West Ham United are up next and the Reds cannot afford to take their foot off the pedal after such a morale-boosting victory.",

He has spent 935 days injured in his professional career and has been unavailable for 146 games as a result.",

      "“He subbed me after 60 minutes and we had a Europa League game coming up a week or so after the League Cup game, which I did not think I had a chance of playing in after he subbed me off. However, he started me in the Europa League game and I played the full game which gave me confidence to continue to grow at the club.",
      "\"We went on to win the Europa League against Ajax at the end of the season and that was a great achievement for the club.",
      "“Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed working under Jose Mourinho. He was really good with me as a young player. He is open-minded and he is a very good manager, as his career has shown.”",
      "Mourinho's treatment of young players is well documented but what was so tough for Fosu-Mensah was that not even key ally Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could find a regular place for him in the squad.",
      "Those two loan exits had been sanctioned by Mourinho and the second was cut short when he suffered a knee ligament injury, which saw him return to United in the closing stages of the 2018–19 season. By the time he returned, there was a new manager in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "Fosu-Mensah watched from the sidelines as the United hero went about rebuilding the squad and then, against all the odds, he got opportunities he never expected due to the curtailed pandemic campaign. In June of 2020, Fosu-Mensah made his first United senior matchday squad since May 2017 as he sat on the bench in an FA Cup tie against Norwich.",
      "A month later, with Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams both out injured, Solskjaer called on him to start at left-back ahead of Diogo Dalot against former side Palace at Selhurst Park. He would make another four appearances in the final matches of the season, including in semi-final defeats of both the FA Cup and Europa League.",
      "The Dutch defender was now fully fit, confident, and raring to go into the new campaign. He was desperate to get his chance and he got one right away. Things didn't go according to plan.",
      "He started right back in the opening-day defeat to Crystal Palace but after a poor performance, he was dropped again. Fosu-Mensah only featured from the bench twice more in Champions League defeats away to Istanbul Basaksehir and RB Leipzig.",
      "He would never play for the club again. Fosu-Mensah rejected a new contract as he felt 'undervalued' by the terms offered. Those close to the player insisted he was sad to be leaving but 'excited to get a fresh start and show people what he was really capable of.'",
      "\"It was my decision,\" he later reiterated. \"The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing. I didn’t play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.",
      "“The club and the manager were good to me. I recovered from a big injury; they helped me and gave me minutes. I played in the FA Cup semi-final and the Europa League semi-final. But it’s important to play regularly and to get my opportunity in the national team too.",
      "“Ole has been very good to me. I spoke with him because he had a big injury as a player so he knew exactly how I felt. When I played against Crystal Palace after 16 months, he was very happy for me. These were very good moments. He knew I had the quality. I have no bad things to say about him because he has been very good to me.\"",
      "It's a real shame that three years later he is back where he was to begin with: looking to prove himself after another serious injury. Fosu-Mensah should be praised for taking the risk to leave the club when he had doubts about his future and if there is anyone who deserves a slice of luck, it is him.",
      "Leverkusen and United fans will be happy to see him back. Leroy Sane might not be so happy to face him again.",

      "Guillermo Varela was David Moyes' first signing as Man United manager and there were high hopes for the defender.",
      "The history books show Guillermo Varela was the first signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Varela officially became David Moyes' first signing when joining United from Penarol in June 2013, but many considered the transfer as Ferguson's parting gift.",
      "That's because Varela had undergone a successful trial in the final months of Ferguson's reign and a deal had been negotiated before Moyes took up his position. The legendary Scot believed Varela had the potential to become an outstanding right-back, however, he was unable to nail down a regular starting position under three different United managers.",
      "“I was younger so it was difficult to come to Manchester United and try to play at 20 years old - I'm not Rashford,\" Varela said in an interview with The Sun in 2019.",
      "Varela was just 20 years old when he moved to Manchester and he spent the 2013/14 season playing in the academy before the decision was made to send him on loan.",
      "The defender joined Real Madrid's reserve side, who were managed by Zinedine Zidane. “I was with the Castilla team under Zidane for one year,\" Varela said.",
      "\"I would train two or three times a week with the first team. It was magnificent. With Cristiano, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale as well. I spoke with Cristiano about Manchester United. Chicharito (Hernández) moved at the same time with me. We lived separately but he was very helpful.”",
      "Varela made 33 appearances for Real Madrid Castilla and he was named in the first team's squad for the Champions League. The spell was a success and a return to United followed.",
      "Louis van Gaal was in charge by then and he provided Varela with a string of appearances, with the right-back making his United senior bow against West Ham in December 2015.",
      "\"I have been pleased with the progress of the younger players when they've been called to train with the first-team squad so I am not afraid of using them if required,\" Van Gaal said.",
      "Just three days later, Varela made his first start for United when playing in a 3-2 defeat to Wolfsburg, a result which sealed the Reds' exit from the Champions League. However, Matteo Darmian was Van Gaal's first-choice right-back and he continued to be selected for the majority of games, which meant Varela had to be patient for starts.",
      "That patience was rewarded in February 2016 when Darmian sustained an injury, which meant Varela started in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 32 against FC Midtjylland. Varela assisted Marcus Rashford in a comfortable 5-1 win and he was one of the best performers that night, which saw him retain his place for the Round of 16 clash against Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool won the first leg 2-0 at Anfield and Varela started again in the reverse fixture, but what happened next essentially ended his time at the club.",
      "Anthony Martial opened the scoring with a penalty in the 32nd minute, but Liverpool equalised just before half-time when Phillipe Coutinho burst down the left and went around Varela.",
      "Coutinho made beating Varela look simple before he dinked the ball over David de Gea and that mistake was enough for Van Gaal to hook him during the interval.",
      "\"It is football,\" Varela later said about his performance and substitution against Liverpool. “Van Gaal gave me the chance to play so I have to say thank you. He is a crazy coach.",
      "\"He was always angry with the players but it was good. I enjoyed it. I played 11 matches. I enjoyed every single one. I played one game in the Champions League, I played in the Europa League. Playing for Manchester United is amazing. Of course, it was a dream.",
      "“Growing up, it was always about Manchester United, ahead of Real Madrid and Barcelona, because of Diego Forlan playing there. So for a player from Uruguay, it was a dream to play for Manchester United. He was my hero.",
      "“But I had to play more. At Manchester United, playing only one or two games a month was not good. I had to play every game and at Manchester United that was difficult.”",
      "Varela featured in a handful of first-team and academy matches during the remainder of that season, so it wasn't a surprise to see him omitted from the 2016 FA Cup final squad.",
      "Van Gaal was sacked after victory against Crystal Palace in that final and Jose Mourinho was named as his successor. The Portuguese took his first pre-season match against Wigan and Varela came on from the bench, but there was no room for him on the subsequent tour of China.",
      "United embarked on their pre-season tour and Varela was sent on loan again, this time to Eintracht Frankfurt. He was now 23 and aware he needed a run of consistent matches. But disaster struck in just Varela's third appearance for Frankfurt when he suffered torn ankle ligaments, which required surgery and a screw inserted into his leg.",
      "Varela returned to action after five months on the sidelines, but he was still struggling with pain caused by the injury, so he underwent further surgery. Although the injury meant he was unavailable for the DFB-Pokal Cup final against Borussia Dortmund, it was suggested his absence was actually due to an infected tattoo.",
      "Varela had received fresh ink during his spell on the sidelines and it allegedly caused inflammation of his arm. Frankfurt reacted by suspending him and ordering his return to Manchester.",
      "\"My name is polluted. I wonder what Real Madrid should do with Sergio Ramos, who is tattooing every week,\" Varela reacted at the time, trying to protest his innocence.",
      "\"I cannot explain why I'm being so severely punished, and I'm not the only Eintracht professional to get a tattoo before the final, but only I was nailed to the cross for going against the manager.",
      "\"Before the 2016 FA Cup final [against Crystal Palace], we went out with several players and got a tattoo, and then we won. Now I wanted to repeat that because it brought us so much luck with Manchester.\"",
      "Frankfurt's sporting director responded: \"The club cannot tolerate that a player would defy instructions. He hurt the team. There was redness around where he had the tattoo, and blisters formed meaning he was unable to train.",
      "\"We'd been thinking about a loan extension. But that won't happen. He'll be suspended with immediate effect.\"",
      "A few years later, Varela attempted to clarify the tattoo situation. “I got a tattoo at the top of my back on my neck,\" he said. \"It was during my injury, while I was not playing, about three months before the final in May.",
      "“[Manager] Niko Kovac said to me, 'I don't want you to get any more tattoos.' I said, 'Why? I'm injured'. He said, 'Yes, I know but you have to respect the players and the staff.'",
      "“I said, 'Okay, I understand but I am injured.' Then when I started to play again I got this one done on my arm [a woman's face].",
      "\"He said to me, 'No, no, no. You stop here because we have the final in one week and I told you before you have to finish with your tattoos so now you are out.' I didn't get infected, that's not true. It was just because I got it.”",
      "Varela returned to Manchester after a disappointing spell with Frankfurt but had no regrets. \"I talked to Jose Mourinho and we talked about my future and what would be best for me,\" he told the Manchester Evening News.",
      "\"He was very sincere towards me. He told me my playing time would be little so my decision was that I preferred to go. A player needs to play and that's what I sought in Frankfurt.\"",
      "Varela was sold by Mourinho in the summer of 2017 and he re-signed for Penarol. \"I really learnt a lot from the way he [Mourinho] trained - the ball was always in the centre of the exercises,\" he said.",
      "\"The relationship was very good and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I expected his character when he is confronted with the press, but that was definitely not the case.",
      "\"He's always asking how everyone feels, making no difference between Rooney or a player who has just come up. He was always joking and ensuring he had a good connection between everyone and himself.\"",
      "His time at United came to an underwhelming end and, at the time, a source close to the player told the MEN that he returned to his former club for 'personal tranquillity'.",
      "\"The player decided [to join Penarol] after how badly he was treated in Frankfurt. His experience in Europe was not good,\" they said.",
      "Varela left having made 11 first-team appearances for United and he also scored an injury-time winner as the club's Under-21s won the academy Premier League title in 2016.",
      "Many fans were disappointed to see Varela leave the club and he got his career back on track with Penarol before eventually returning to Europe in January 2019.",
      "Varela signed for FC Copenhagen and it was there he admitted he would love a return to Old Trafford in the future. “It would be a dream to go back to Old Trafford. It would be a beautiful moment,\" he said.",
      "\"I wait for this. Maybe we will get drawn to play Manchester United - we don't know. But if we do, it would be a dream. Maybe we will meet again soon. Maybe in the Europa League, maybe in the Premier League.",
      "“I'm still only 26. I of course want to go back to the Premier League at some point. In the future, maybe I can come back and play for Manchester United - I hope.",
      "“I would say thank you to the fans. I want to say thank you for a beautiful four years, thank you for your support.”",
      "Varela was denied his wish of a return to Old Trafford by the pandemic because when United drew Copenhagen in the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2020, it was a one-off match and played at a neutral venue in Germany. Nonetheless, he started the game and was brought off in extra time.",
      "Varela made over 50 appearances for Copenhagen and played a similar number of games when signing for Dynamo Moscow, but he desired a return to South America.",
      "Since the summer of 2022, Varela has played for Brazilian club Flamengo and represented Uruguay at the Qatar World Cup.",
      "He has finally found his 'personal tranquillity' at 30 years old.",

      "\"It was a five-man United defence to see out nine minutes of time added on and they still managed to be outnumbered in the counterattack for Neto’s goal. Yet just as Wolves thought they had secured the draw, Mainoo took a pass from Forson and scored the goal of his life.",
      "\"From nowhere in particular on the left he went around the substitute Joao Gomes, slipped the ball through the legs of Max Kilman and dispatched the winner past Jose Sa.\"",
      "Chris Wheeler, of the Daily Mail, wrote: \"This was a massive win for them and not just because the gap to the top-four is only eight points now.",
      "\"They seem to be gathering momentum at a time when Ten Hag desperately needs it. If this wasn’t his strongest team, then it was pretty close to it now Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro and Luke Shaw are back in action.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational winner for Man Utd at Wolves in what was a much-improved performance from Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "If Manchester United's season is going to turn on anything, then surely it is the three minutes of madness at Molineux that saw the best and the worst of them on a chaotic, cathartic night.",
      "This was a game United had bossed only to throw away. They produced one of their best performances of the season but managed to lay bare all of their flaws to concede a third goal in stoppage time. It was lamentable from Antony, tactically naive from many and poor from Andre Onana. It was a season in microcosm.",
      "But maybe, just maybe, times are changing. For once the mistakes didn't cost United. They got up off the canvas to throw one more haymaker, in the form of a moment of magic from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Just as the 3,000 supporters in the away end were beginning to lament the soft centre of their team once again, the teenager from Stockport sent them wild. He turned away from one challenge, cut inside another, opened up a shooting angle and picked his spot. It was a quite brilliant goal from a midfielder who doesn't turn 19 until April.",
      "And just as Ten Hag had suggested, United had begun to look like their old selves, albeit with a few of those flaws still on display.",
      "The Dutchman hadn't shied away from the pressure recently. His returning stars in January were going to be like \"five or six new signings\" and the squad he could pick at Wolves was \"probably the strongest\" since he had been at the club. At a time when the United manager was under pressure, he embraced it.",
      "Ten Hag's job security has been getting weaker all season and he went into this trip to Molineux with United ninth in the Premier League. Defeat to an in-form Wolves would have left them 10th well past the halfway stage.",
      "At a time when Sir Dave Brailsford is omnipresent at Carrington and Ineos are driving up standards, the spotlight on Ten Hag has been inescapable, even if his early discussions with Brailsford and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have been positive.",
      "Sharing a vision for the future and an understanding of what is wrong is all well and good, however. Ten Hag was only ever going to strengthen his grip on the United job by getting results. A desperate season simply had to improve.",
      "With the treatment room clearing, this felt like a jumping-off point. Day one of Ten Hag's true audition for his own job. This morning he will feel a little more secure in the post.",
      "“For the first time since I was the manager, we can pick a team from the squad that is probably the strongest,\" Ten Hag had said of this game in the aftermath of Sunday's scrappy win at Newport. In his 94th game in charge, this was the best team he had picked.",
      "Of those still unavailable, there is an argument Mason Mount would make a difference. Ten Hag clearly had his reasons for spending £55million on him this summer, but Mainoo has made a better fist of doing that job than the England international. Other than that, this is the best team Ten Hag has picked.",
      "He had his new goalkeeper in situ. His first-choice full-backs alongside his World Cup-winning centre-backs of Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane. Casemiro was patrolling midfield with Mainoo the link point to Bruno Fernandes. Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford carried a threat out wide and Rasmus Hojlund is finding his feet through the middle.",
      "True to his word, with key men back and those rhythms established, United began to perform. This was, by some distance, their most coherent, most structured performance of the season. They were dangerous going forward and defended well until the meltdown began in the final 20 minutes.",
      "The tone was set by Rashford's early redemption and control established through a slick move to bring Hojlund his third goal in as many Premier League starts. But it was the quality of some of United's football that stood out.",
      "Dalot was regularly drifting back into those central midfield roles, at one point taking station in an attacking midfield area to chest down a drilled pass forward from Casemiro. Fernandes picked it up and United had turned defence into attack with one good pass and one piece of clever movement.",
      "Casemiro was excellent, delivering a performance that suggested his United obituaries might have been penned too soon. The 31-year-old had struggled in the first half of the season but shrugged off an early booking at Molineux to dominate midfield. His passing was crisp and his positioning shrewd. He provided the defensive shield that had been beyond him before his injury in November and was unfortunate to concede the penalty from which Pablo Sarabia brought Wolves back into the game, before Scott McTominay scored.",
      "How Ten Hag needs last season's version of his £70million signing to be back permanently. The ability to salvage this season lay chiefly with Martinez and Casemiro and how close they get to recapturing their levels from 2022/23.",
      "On this evidence - albeit against a poor Wolves side - they might just have decisive contributions to make. It was telling they weren't on the pitch as the game unravelled. Max Kilman took advantage of some sloppy defending from a corner before Wolves somehow managed to launch a counterattack in the 95th minute.",
      "Antony lost the ball softly and too many United players were caught too far up the pitch when protecting a lead. Onana didn't do enough to stop Neto's shot at his near post.",
      "But Molineux was silenced by Mainoo. There have been too many false dawns this season to get too carried away, but this was as positive a night as any this campaign. This result was built on more secure foundations than those dramatic wins against Brentford, Chelsea and Aston Villa and those unconvincing ones against Sheffield United, Luton and Fulham.",
      "They have to improve defensively, but this was encouraging for United and for Ten Hag, at a time when he really needed his luck to turn.",

      "Man Utd won a thrilling and chaotic game 4-3 at Wolves on a night when Marcus Rashford delivered some redemption after his Belfast antics.",
      "Rashford's redemption",
      "The stadium PA was going through his own rehearsed routine as the Manchester United squad went through their final warm-up at Molineux. One wonders whether Marcus Rashford's musical knowledge allowed him to pick up the cover version of Terrorvision's Tequila or the song of the same name by The Champs.",
      "A week ago Rashford was downing Tequila in the bars of Belfast and was a matter of hours from waking up bleary-eyed in the city and phoning in sick for United training. He would subsequently miss the trip to Newport County and has been in the spotlight ever since.",
      "After showdown talks on Monday, United said Rashford had \"taken responsibility\" for his actions and been disciplined, but was available for selection. It was still a surprise to see him in the starting XI at Wolves.",
      "But if he felt he owed people a performance he began to deliver inside five minutes. When Rasmus Hojlund teed him up for the shot from the edge of the area the chance was still a difficult one, but Rashford picked his spot beautifully, leaving Jose Sa with no chance. He ran over to the away end to celebrate, although showed little emotion as he stood in front of those jubilant supporters.",
      "This was easily the most engaged and enthused he has looked on the pitch this season, however, and if he was fearing some brickbats from the away end, midway through the first half they were serenading him with a sustained chant of \"Rashford's on the p**s\".",
      "By then he had sprinted back to close down Nelson Semedo and had a detailed tactical discussion with Rasmus Hojlund. He then helped create Hojlund's goal with a perfectly weighted pass to Luke Shaw on the overlap.",
      "Casemiro reminds us of his class",
      "Casemiro has been back in the side for two games and already he's collected two more bookings, taking his tally to five in his last six appearances, which also includes that Champions League red card against Galatasaray.",
      "He was late to a tackle against Newport County on Sunday and was booked very early at Molineux when he got a tackle against Semedo all wrong and upended the full-back.",
      "But this was a much better performance on the ball from the Brazilian, who picked some good passes from deep areas and controlled the play at times. He was also better defensively and the away end sang his name when he stood up to Matheus Cunha as he attempted to dribble through him late in the first half.",
      "He was also unlucky to give a penalty away for a trip on Pedro Neto when contact seemed minimal. Jarred Gillett pointed to the spot on the pitch and despite a lengthy VAR review, there was not enough evidence to overturn the decision, although there was no indication of any contact.",
      "Seeing games out",
      "It was always going to take something special to overtake United's injury-time comeback against Brentford for the most dramatic end to a game this season, but this might have done it.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's magnificent winner will live long in the memory but United should be kicking themselves at how difficult they made it. The goal they conceded to Max Kilman was soft and the equaliser was awful.",
      "It was naive to be caught on the break from your own corner in the 95th minute when protecting a 3-2 lead, and it's not the first time United have been poor defensively from their own corners this season.",
      "They got away with it, but as good as aspects of this performance were, they have to tighten up defensively if they are to make up ground to the top five.",
      "Martinez's influence is clear",
      "Of all the players United have missed this season, Lisandro Martinez has been one of the most costly, with the 23 games he missed with a recurrence of his foot injury affecting the offensive and defensive stability of the team.",
      "Martinez has been excellent since signing from Ajax but his quality and calmness in possession is just as vital to the build-up as his reading of the game and aggression is to defending.",
      "Losing Martinez certainly didn't help Andre Onana's integration into the side but since his return it's been noticeable how much better United are looking as they pass out from deep areas. Onana is finding Martinez far more often than he ever went short to Jonny Evans and it's giving the team options as they build the play.",
      "The Argentine showed his defensive brilliance as well with a superb goalline clearance after Kilman had beaten Onana to a free-kick. His header was heading for the back of the net until Martinez came to the rescue.",
      "Shaw and Rashford link-up",
      "Who knows what brought the best out of Rashford on Thursday night, but it will have helped him having Luke Shaw behind him once again. There's little doubt that Rashford produces his best football on the left when he is in tandem with the excellent Shaw.",
      "Twice in the early stages they linked up well, with Rashford holding the ball while he waited for his full-back to go past him on the overlap. The second goal came from the same combination.",
      "Shaw is one of several key men returning to the team at the moment and he might be able to get the best out of Rashford, who is beginning to find some form of his own with five goal contributions in his last five appearances.",
      "United had to muddle through without a natural left-back with Shaw sidelined, but he is one of the key members of this squad and his understanding of how to play with Rashford is also a key weapon.",

However, this did not stop the club from completing a host of departures: several academy players and fringe stars departed on loan, notably Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri and Facundo Pellistri.",
      "The biggest exit from a United perspective came as Jadon Sancho left on loan to join Borussia Dortmund. Crucially though, the Bundesliga giants have confirmed they will find it difficult to make this switch permanent in the summer. This news, coupled with the lack of signings means this window could be considered below par among the fanbase. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have a huge summer ahead of them, with multiple areas of the squad needing quality.",
      "By the time the next window opens, Ratcliffe should have had his investment in United ratified by the Premier League and his staff will be tasked with rebuilding the club. Plenty of new signings will be expected but departures shall also be necessary to shake off the burden of Premier League Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR).",

      "Moyes made the admission ahead of Sunday's Premier League meeting between the two clubs at Old Trafford. United moved to within a point of the Hammers in the standings after Thursday night's enthralling 4-3 win over Wolves at Molineux.",
      "The victory in the Black Country, which marked United's first league triumph of 2024, coincided with the likes of Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw and Casemiro all starting in the league for the first time since recovering from respective injury problems. United were much-improved and their first-half showing saw them produce the best football they had played all season.",
      "Moyes, who guided the Hammers to a 2-0 win over United before Christmas, has been in Ten Hag's shoes and understands the demands that come with managing the Reds. Though the Dutchman has got a lot of work to do to try and salvage United's season, Moyes believes he is starting to implement the style of play he wants to see.",
      "Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, Moyes said: \"Erik ten Hag is in a privileged position to be manager of Manchester United. I think he understands and respects that.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund had to wait until Boxing Day to score his first goal for Man Utd in the Premier League but he has now scored in three successive league outings.",
      "The goals are finally starting to flow for Rasmus Hojlund. After 14 Premier League games without a goal, the £72millon striker has now scored in three successive league outings and his Boxing Day breakthrough against Aston Villa is increasingly looking like the moment the floodgates opened.",
      "Hojlund was the striker who could only score in Europe until then, which wasn't ideal given United were out of Europe by December. But his acrobatic strike to cap off Christmas was celebrated with abandon and lifted a weight from his shoulders. He has kicked on since then.",
      "He missed the very next game - a defeat at Nottingham Forest - through illness but it didn't halt his momentum. He missed some chances in the FA Cup third round at Wigan but has since scored against Tottenham and Wolves in the Premier League, either side of netting at Newport County.",
      "It's taken his tally for the season to nine and a return of 0.42 goals per 90 minutes in a team that has spent most of the year struggling suddenly looks a lot more respectable. Although his lengthy domestic drought was a concern, Hojlund's five goals in the Champions League showed he had the talent to thrive, which is why his scoring spurt in the Premier League has been more a case of relief than affirmation that he is cut out for this level.",
      "Asked if he felt the goals would begin to come more easily once he had his first, Hojlund said: \"Yes and no. I knew I could score goals and I’d shown it in the Champions League and at my previous clubs, but of course opening the account it’s always like ‘ok, I can do it’.\"",
      "His winner against Villa was smartly taken and his rasping finish early on against Spurs was another indication of the talent that convinced Erik ten Hag to take an expensive punt on a striker still relatively inexperienced at the highest level. His goal in United's thrilling and chaotic 4-3 win at Wolves on Thursday was from the scrappier variety but they all count and he is beginning to feel at home now in a team that has its best players returning from injury.",
      "\"We’re starting to understand each other better into the team and I think I’m getting used to the Premier League and the tempo and how we play as a team and these sort of things,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course [it was going to take time], but if you ask me I would have loved to score my first goal in September or October.\"",
      "Hojlund's goals have come at a point when United are threatening to find some form. Although they nearly blew it, the performance at Wolves was one of their best of the season and they have won four of their last six games, while also drawing with Tottenham in that run.",
      "The former Atalanta striker believes there are signs the team is starting to click now and that the forwards are finding a nice balance between going solo and providing for each other.",
      "\"It’s good to see, I hope we can keep going, keep the confidence in the team, keep providing for each other. I think that’s key, we’re being selfish when we have to but we also play for each other,\" said Hojlund.",
      "\"Offensively, I think we were very great. We created a lot of chances [against Wolves] and four goals is a lot and we could score even more so very happy with that.\"",

      "Manchester United recorded their first Premier League win of 2024 on Thursday night, beating Wolves 4-3 in dramatic fashion at Molineux.",
      "After Pedro Neto appeared to have earned Wolves a point, making it 3-3 with 95 minutes on the clock, Kobbie Mainoo produced a moment of magic to score his first Premier League goal two minutes later. He curled a shot into the far corner from just inside the penalty area.",
      "United had earlier led 2-0 and 3-1, netting through Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Scott McTominay. The latter put the Reds 3-1 up less than two minutes after stepping off the bench. The win, which was fully merited, moved United up to seventh in the Premier League standings, one point behind sixth-placed West Ham United.",
      "Though the scoreline suggested it was a close battle that the Reds narrowly edged, their performance was much more convincing, meaning they now have a platform to try and build on, starting against West Ham this weekend. Below, MEN Sport has highlighted some of the moments you may not have spotted from the seven-goal contest at Molineux.",
      "As those in close proximity to Hojlund immediately mobbed him after he turned home United's second goal in the Black Country, Alejandro Garnacho, who had initially peeled away from his marker in anticipation of being found by Luke Shaw, had a moment to himself. Sinking to his knees, the Argentine raised his arms in the direction of the sky, highlighting how much the goal meant to him, despite not scoring it himself.",
      "After raising his arms aloft, he then lowered them and, just for a second, buried his head in the turf and put his hands on his head. It was clearly an emotional moment for the youngster, who, without even scoring, demonstrated his passion and love for the club. Once back on his feet, he embraced the likes of Shaw, Rashford and the goalscorer, Hojlund, who had bagged his third league goal in as many games.",
      "Though United were dominant in the opening 45 minutes, they did on a couple of occasions have to shutdown potential Wolves openings. With 42 minutes on the clock, the hosts attempted to break into the left-hand channel of the United penalty area.",
      "Right-back Diogo Dalo stood firm and produced a block that in the end saw the ball bounce back off a Wolves player and go behind for a goal-kick. Lisandro Martinez came over to embrace Dalot and celebrate his defensive contribution, before Andre Onana and Raphael Varane followed suit.",
      "Between them the quartet celebrated the goal-kick like a goal. It was reminiscent of when Martinez and Varane reacted when Dalot produced a similar block in the 1-0 win at Leicester City in September 2022.",
      "Just 80 seconds after stepping off the bench, seemingly in a ploy to try and beef up United's midfield, McTominay was running in the direction of United's fans to celebrate putting them 3-1 up. It marked his seventh goal of the season in all competitions and it arrived at a vitally important juncture.",
      "As he was mobbed by his United teammates, including Martinez, who almost ripped the shirt off the Scot's back among the celebrations, Erik ten Hag and Casemiro celebrated the goal on the touchline. The Brazilian had just stepped off the pitch to pave the way for McTominay to come on and he embraced his manager with a huge hug with both knowing the magnitude of the goal.",
      "The first of many? If Mainoo's ceiling is anything to go by it most probably will be. After scoring one of the most dramatic United winners in recent years, Mainoo was mobbed by his teammates following the full-time whistle.",
      "Almost every member of the team made it their mission to rush over to him following the conclusion of the game. It was another sign of togetherness and unity within the squad.",

      "The Molineux pre-match playlist included a cover version of Terrorvision's Tequila by The Champs. Marcus Rashford enjoyed a more palatable shot in the fifth minute and anyone watching this coruscating contest will have felt giddy.",
      "The Manchester United supporters enjoyed the ultimate adrenaline shot in the 97th minute. Kobbie Mainoo, Rashford's heir as the local academy poster boy, settled the game. United players and staff spilled onto the pitch and Sir Alex Ferguson grinned broadly.",
      "This was only United's fifth away win of the season and, for 45 minutes, by far the most convincing and captivating. And still they could not avoid a night of drama as Wolves were gifted three goals.",
      "Wolves left it late for their last - the 95th minute. United scored later. Mainoo, rightly crowned the club's player of the month for January, is developing stratospherically and his goal is an early contender for the standout strike of this month.",
      "Mainoo danced past three opponents as though they were training cones and maintained the composure to arch the ball out of Jose Sa's reach. Mainoo does not turn 19 until April. He celebrated as coolly as he scored but was mobbed by teammates.",
      "History happily repeated itself for United with Rashford putting them 1-0 up at Molineux. \"Rashford's on the p--s,\" chortled the away dayers in the Steve Bull Stand. Unlike last season, the scoring did not stop at one.",
      "Erik ten Hag's man-management has not been as tactful this season and this was a reminder of the influence he still wields at United. Many would have had Rashford down as a substitute rather than a starter. Ten Hag prioritised the strength of his team.",
      "For this was the first time he was able to pick his strongest United XI in his 94th match in charge. It showed. United were 2-0 up, squandered two great chances and had two goals disallowed in the first half alone. They cannot put teams to bed and twice they threw away two-goal advantages.",
      "They have left it until February but for 45 minutes this was the real United. Wolves were unbeaten in seven matches and last lost at home in September. United's fixtures in the Black Country are usually a chore and settled by the odd goal. This was one of the games of the season.",
      "Following the silk of the first half, steel was required in the second. Wolves scraped three goals and United were sucker punched on the breakaway in the 95th minute.",
      "Pedro Neto appeared to have rendered Ten Hag's in-game management of throwing on scorer Scott McTominay moot. Antony, another substitute, was a constant liability and turned attack into defence. He was reprieved by the magnificent Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag has staked much on the returning players and the presence of Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez was especially noticeable. Casemiro complements Mainoo better than any other central midfielder. The manager still regained the Midas touch with bold calls.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, pitted against a back three, was anything but outnumbered. He savoured his scruffy conversion from Shaw's double-deflected cross almost as much as his maiden Premier League goal on Boxing Day. That is now three goals in three league games. As it is for Rashford.",
      "United were incisive and slick before Rashford caressed the ball beyond Sa in the fifth minute and they maintained that momentum once they had finished their celebrations. During a stoppage in the 19th minute, Rashford advised Hojlund, Diogo Dalot collared Alejandro Garnacho and Lisandro Martinez held court with Dalot and Raphael Varane.",
      "Dalot, Martinez and Varane ardently celebrated a goal kick in the last knockings of the first half, a scene reminiscent of their early rearguard days. The spirit of this United was more in keeping with their winning streaks under Ten Hag. The cub Mainoo earned compliments for his prudence with the ball.",
      "Casemiro and Fernandes missed the target with the goal gaping at 2-0, Varane skimmed the roof of the net and when Hojlund and Casemiro beat Sa they were denied by the linesman's flag.",
      "The Wolves denizens, still revelling in Sunday's bloody derby defeat of West Brom at kick-off, quickly quietened save for audible exasperations at the error-laden performance.",
      "For all the scrutiny surrounding Rashford's body language, Ten Hag has often appeared stumped on the touchline this season. On this occasion, he was proactive bordering on animated. His players ensured he did not have to be overly demonstrative.",
      "Casemiro halted one attack and was serenaded by the United fans. The Brazilian was booked for a crude and cynical foul on Nelson Semedo in the third minute but then the Casemiro of last season resurfaced until he needlessly dangled a leg to upend Neto in the penalty area.",
      "Ten Hag replaced Casemiro with McTominay, scorer of United's third within two minutes of his introduction. Casemiro leaped from the bench and hugged Ten Hag.",
      "United's Latino influence was present in the back four. Martinez anticipated another potential Andre Onana howler and hooked Max Kilman's header off the goal line. It is not a coincidence United were at their most gettable with the Argentine off the pitch and Onana conceded preventable goals to Kilman and Neto.",
      "Rashford was at the back of the queue as the players emerged for their warm-up. He raised his hands, looked at the heavens, whispered a quiet prayer and sauntered towards a loose ball to embark on a dribble. Whatever the prayer, it was answered.",
      "When he re-emerged for kick-off and did a shuttle run towards the away end, there was a ripple of applause but none from Rashford. He played the first half in front of them and charged towards them after scoring.",
      "Rashford initially stared rather than smiled but he cracked into one at the behest of Casemiro, who playfully patted him on the head. Rashford joked last week he is capable of smiling and this was the hitherto highlight of his season.",
      "The United fans put their hands together again in the 37th minute when Rashford slid to intercept a pass. Those daring to head down the gangways at 3-3 may have trundled down them when Mainoo clipped the ball in.",
      "They will drink to Mainoo's shot on the coaches back to Manchester.",

      "Borussia Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl has explained why it would be hard to strike a deal with Manchester United for Jadon Sancho",
      "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has conceded it's unlikely Jadon Sancho will sign for the club permanently - even if Manchester United look to offload the forward in the summer.",
      "The 23-year-old, who spent four years at Dortmund after signing from Manchester City in 2017, returned to the club last month on a loan deal until the end of the season. His return to the Bundesliga from Old Trafford came after a public falling out with manager Erik ten Hag back in September.",
      "Since returning to the Signal Iduna Park, Sancho has provided two assists in three Bundesliga games and helped Edin Terzic's side kick-start their pursuit of Champions League qualification with three consecutive league wins.",
      "However, Kehl has all-but-ruled out Sancho making his return to Dortmund permanent, insisting that the price United would demand for the forward would make any future deal \"very, very difficult.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports Germany, Kehl said: \"Unfortunately for both players [Ian Maatsen and Jadon Sancho], neither option was really realistic. If you know what we got for Jadon Sancho two and a half years ago, then you know also that it might now be very, very difficult.",
      "\"We naturally advocated for an option with him - and also with Ian - but the negotiating position was not such that we could implement it and so we will accept it for now.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if Sancho, whose deal at Old Trafford runs until 2026, will ever play for United under Ten Hag again.",

Head of the Academy, Nick Cox, said he was genuinely intrigued to know who the next would be. It might not be Sam Mather, but he could well be one of the following crop to do so.",

      "He not only had three goals in 15 minutes, but he could quite easily have had five. But if you don't take those chances, you will be punished. Norwich didn't have many but got one back on the stroke of half time when Ken Aboh fired into the bottom corner after a brilliant solo run.",
      "Norwich were much improved after the restart but when a player is in red-hot form, there is little you can do. United worked the ball well on the edge of the box and when it reached Mather at the back post, he cut inside and curled a beautiful effort into the far corner of the net.",

      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Manchester United have won four out of their last six games, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo impressing; both teenagers have stepped up for Erik ten Hag ahea dof the season run-in;  watch Man Utd vs West Ham live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm",
      "Saturday 3 February 2024 08:51, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Our tipster Jones Knows provides his betting insight and analysis across all Sunday's Premier League games as he hunts some value in Sky Bet's markets.",
      "Nottingham Forest's key to success under Nuno Espirito Santo will be how successful their counter-attacking game works, especially away from home as shown in their impressive win at Newcastle. That doesn't bode well for them for this encounter though as they are up against a Bournemouth side that are notoriously hard to counter-attack. The Cherries have shipped just 1.38 worth of expected goals from fast breaks this season - it's the third best record in the Premier League when it comes to that metric. Forest may struggle to cause problems.",
      "Adding Dominic Solanke to score to a home win considering he's found the net 10 times in last 11 appearances in all competitions makes sense at 6/4 with Sky Bet should provide punters with a good run.",
      "I don't want any part of the 4/7 with Sky Bet on a Chelsea win.",
      "Can you trust them to get back on a positive footing following such a lacklustre and timid performance at Liverpool? I certainly can't especially against a Wolves side that beat them 2-1 over the Christmas period.",
      "Gary O'Neil's side do carry a big threat in the final third to the extent they've scored 33 goals this season - that's two more than they managed in the whole of last season. The three they got in their defeat to Manchester United makes it 18 goals scored in their last eight matches.",
      "Wolves' goal threat isn't really being respected by the market with Pedro Neto and Matheus Cunha both priced up at 4/1 to score. That looks generous in a game Wolves are capable of avoiding defeat in.",
      "West Ham are sixth in the Premier League and have lost just one of their last 11 Premier League games.",
      "Yet there is clear discontent in the stands - for good reason too.",
      "West Ham's underlying performance metrics this season scream 'overachievement' loud and clear. Based on expected goals for and against, equated into points won, West Ham have 11 points more than their performance data shows. The addition of Kalvin Phillips has only provided David Moyes with more problems to contend with in terms of his balance in midfield.",
      "I was expecting Manchester United to be shorter than the 3/5 with Sky Bet on offer considering their increased productivity in front of goal since Christmas, scoring 10 in their last four games and Rasmus Hojlund looking the part as the focal point. Home win.",
      "Huge. A Super Sunday to savour.",
      "A win for Liverpool may catapult them into title favourites with Sky Bet and would end Arsenal's hopes of landing the main prize. Jurgen Klopp will know that. He's not one to shirk such opportunities either. Liverpool will be Liverpool.",
      "The jeopardy is huge for Arsenal, who are still to prove they possess the attacking metrics to mix it with Manchester City and Klopp's men at the business end of this season. It looks a two-horse race to me.",
      "What's the bet then?",
      "It must be a pro-Liverpool angle based on their attacking metrics of late, where they've averaged 22.5 shots per 90 minutes in their last 11 matches. And despite him letting us down for the 8/1 best bet treble in midweek, I'm keeping the faith with Curtis Jones and his shots prices. He's had 22 shots in his last eight fixtures. The 2/1 with Sky Bet on him firing two or more does make plenty of appeal.",
      "This won't be a straightforward night for Pep Guardiola's side but those taking them on at 4/11 with Sky Bet are likely to end up with burnt fingers such is their focus and supreme reliability at this time of year. City won 14 of 15 Premier League games between the 22nd-36th Premier League gameweeks last season. This is their time.",
      "My punting instincts have taken me to the player fouls market where Ruben Dias rates as a fair wager to make two or more fouls at 100/30 with Sky Bet. The Brentford front two of Neal Maupay and Ivan Toney bring the nuisance factor to the table in that they are very smart at winning fouls.",
      "Since being paired together in their last two fixtures, they've won 12 fouls between them. It's a ratio that should stay consistent so it certainly brings Dias into the mix in terms of his foul probability. He's made two or more fouls in seven of his last 13 starts, making 17 fouls in total. He will fight fire with fire up against the Brentford duo. He's a big price.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",

      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",
      "Wolves: Sa (5), Kilman (6), Dawson (6), Toti (4), Semedo (6), Doyle (6), Lemina (6), Doherty (4), Bellegarde (5), Neto (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ait-Nouri (7), Sarabia (7), Gomes (n/a), Fraser (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (5), Dalot (6), Varane (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Mainoo (8), Casemiro (6), Garnacho (6), Fernandes (7), Rashford (7), Hojlund (7).\n\n\nSubs: Antony (5), McTominay (7), Maguire (n/a), Evans (n/a), Forson (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",

      "Marcus Rashford has been the focus of yet another disciplinary breach at Man Utd; this is the third time the England forward has clashed with Erik ten Hag over transgressions; INEOS want to introduce a culture change at Manchester United, but will Rashford's behaviour fit into it?",
      "Wednesday 31 January 2024 09:47, UK",
      "If the words in Manchester United's statement on Marcus Rashford, released late on Monday night, sounded familiar, it is not a trick of the mind.",
      "Two months ago, when the England international partied at Chinawhite nightclub after the derby undressing against Manchester City, Erik ten Hag said \"he apologised and that is it. It is an internal matter\".",
      "The location and context has changed - Rashford reporting himself ill for training last Friday after going out in Belfast the previous two nights - but the protagonist and United's communication remains the same.",
      "Erik ten Hag will face the media at 12.30pm on Wednesday - follow it live on the Sky Sports app and website.",
      "\"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions,\" read the club's statement. \"This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed.\"",
      "Rashford has to ensure it is indeed shut - and not just for a matter of weeks. It is the third time the 26-year-old has been caught transgressing under Ten Hag, the first of which was arriving late for a team meeting.",
      "That seemed innocuous, but his actions since have sparked concerns - even before the tequila-filled details of Thursday emerged from an alleged eyewitness account.",
      "It's not solely Rashford's focus that is in question, but a harsher spotlight is now on the continuous off-field issues at United.",
      "It was during September, in the immediate aftermath of Jadon Sancho's social media offensive against being a \"scapegoat\", that warnings of misbehaviour from other members of the squad began to circulate.",
      "Several privy to the winger's anger at being singled out, isolated, and effectively cancelled at the club before rejoining Borussia Dortmund on loan, insisted there were players flouting Ten Hag's standards at Carrington and beyond.",
      "When Rashford was celebrating at Chinawhite in the early morning despite needing to report to training at the end of October, it was flagged as an example.",
      "However, the incident was brushed aside as a one-off by people close to the forward; it was simply a pre-arranged birthday party.",
      "Ten Hag had also insisted Rashford was \"very motivated to put things right. I know how much effort he is putting in. He makes a mistake but that doesn't say he is not fitting in.",
      "\"He is totally with us. He makes one mistake but also off the pitch what he is doing, how he lives, I am sure he is doing everything right to help the team and to perform and let us win.\"",
      "Managers do not take well to having their authority undermined, being misled, and let down after publicly standing up for a player.",
      "Rashford's repeated eroding of the standards and rules set under the Dutchman is set to send him on a collision course with Ten Hag, but he is also at high risk of clashing with the \"clean culture\" INEOS aim to implement under their sporting control.",
      "As Sky Sports revealed in December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe will implement a more ruthless approach to United's process over player contracts in a bid to prioritise the right ethos and recruitment strategy over business interests.",
      "United want to be more \"culture-focused\" in their decision-making and have noted Arsenal as an example where cutting ties with players instead of trying to hold out for a fee can help reshape a squad and develop an environment of healthy habits and success.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, on United's board and still wading through an audit of the club's football operations, addressed the squad on Monday. He talked them through the INEOS plan of creating an \"ecosystem of excellence\" and how that can only be achieved through total investment from the players, collaborative effort and discipline.",
      "That speech came amid Rashford and his brother/agent Dwaine Maynard meeting with Ten Hag and football director John Murtough, to get a handle on the striker's behaviour.",
      "Rashford means more than most to United, and they have been doing the most to crack the conundrum of what is going on with him. Some at the club feel he just needs a reconfiguring, to be honest with himself about what is truly important and of value to him.",
      "It is interesting to remember what Rashford himself has said about performance less than a year ago. \"Football is probably 95 per cent your mentality. That gives you the baseline to perform. There are a lot of players that have ability - that's why they play at the top level. But what sets them apart is the mentality. I've been on both sides of it.",
      "\"I understand the strength of it and the value. I'm concentrating a lot more on keeping myself in that headspace and it's needed in order to win games and trophies.\"",
      "It is unsurprising that United have sharply moved to draw a line under the misdemeanour. The club have been beset with off-pitch drama in various shapes and at levels of seriousness.",
      "They can ill afford to add another high-profile name and situation to the list. The control for that is out of United's hands though and in Rashford's. He has to show the club, his manager, the supporters and INEOS that he can be trusted.",
      "And that is before his performances even enter the equation. Rashford was in the form of his life last season, top-scoring for United with 30 goals following an inconsistent 18-month stretch hampered by residual shoulder pain.",
      "His return reads four so far this term, in a struggling team desperate for his brilliance when the manager's future and direction of the club is uncertain.",
      "It has been emphasised that if Rashford was still prolific, there would be no fuss over what he was getting up to away from training and matches.",
      "The counter to that is a thread Ten Hag has often stated: what happens on the pitch is a direct result of how you're applying yourself off it. \"I demand the highest standards in sleep, recovery and nutrition because that makes the difference if you can perform every third or fourth day,\" the manager has stated.",
      "He also believes that if you do not respect training in the modern era, you cannot master matches.",
      "Rashford has actually agreed with Ten Hag on this. When he was dropped to the bench against Wolves for arriving late to a team meeting, his assessment was as follows: \"If I was a coach, I'd have done the same. Because if you don't have standards in the training ground, how do you expect to go out on the pitch and win consistently? It's impossible.",
      "\"If you're going to allow each other to slip or have an off day and no one says anything about it … which is at times a position that we've been in.",
      "\"And once you're in it it's difficult to get out of it because it becomes normal and I've not seen it at this club before. It was a little bit strange and it's even more strange when you're involved in it [at Wolves]. So it's constant reminders about discipline.\"",
      "He needs to get his own memos. Rashford will mark eight years in the first team next month. He is in the highest bracket of its earners. Seen as the reference point, it's time to permanently start acting like it again.",

      "Boyhood United fan Will Evans, who was a dairy farmer three years ago, met Adam Lewis' low cross to level proceedings with his 19th goal of the campaign two minutes into the second half to stun their Premier League opponents.",
      "But Antony would finally get off the mark with his 33rd shot of the season - and sixth in the tie - to restore order (68) before Hojlund bundled home from close range (90+4) as United breathed a huge sigh of relief and booked an away tie against either Bristol City or Nottingham Forest in round five.",

      "Newport kept Bayindir honest with efforts from Evans and Ryan Delaney, but Morris' 36th-minute thunderbolt really came out of the blue.",
      "Morris, at Grimsby when the Mariners reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season, chested the ball down and unleashed from 25 yards to beat Bayindir with the help of a deflection off Martinez.",
      "Townsend denied Fernandes with the final kick of the first half and the importance of that save was underlined within two minutes of the restart.",
      "Striker Evans, who has gone from milking cows on the family farm to scoring FA Cup goals - will replay what happened next over and over again as his instinctive finish hauled Newport level.",
      "Raphael Varane was caught on his heels at the near post as the man from the Powys family farm - rejected at Shrewsbury - stole a march to finish beyond Bayindir. Evans has tasted European football at two Welsh Premiership clubs but having broken into the EFL, it was a moment he will cherish for the rest of his career.",
      "By now, Newport - 74 places below their visitors in the football pyramid and financial worlds apart - had one of the biggest upsets in the competition's 152-year history in their sights, but United dug deep and found extra resolve to wrestle back control.",
      "Harry Charsley drove wide, but the visitors retook the lead after 68 minutes as Shaw curled on to a post and Antony slotted the rebound.",
      "Harry Maguire was sent on late to preserve United's slender lead before Hojlund extended his scoring streak by pouncing on a loose ball and drilling home.",
      "Sky Sports' Ben Grounds:",
      "FA Cup glory would be a welcome boost for a club that is preparing to go through a big transition under INEOS, who are set to take control of football operations next month.",
      "Incoming minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a focus on improvements across the board and this competition could provide the platform for under-scrutiny Ten Hag to impress.",
      "United now have a kind-looking fifth-round assignment at either Bristol City or Nottingham Forest, but Ten Hag cannot allow any complacency to seep in.",
      "The return of Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro looked to have brought a calming influence before the chaos while Altay Bayindir looked assured on his debut. But there were very few tangible positives.",
      "Even Antony needed six attempts to get off the mark for the season and United's troubled season was in danger of sinking to a new low before Hojlund sealed matters in stoppage time.",
      "Ten Hag could almost feel the breath of home supporters standing just yards behind him and while this result does alleviate some of the pressure on him, this result and performance was far from convincing.",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag told BBC:",
      "\"First 35 minutes it was very comfortable. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0. They created no chance and then out of nothing - I think also it was a foul - they score.",
      "\"Then straight after half-time, a mistake, ours, defensive transition not great. Then you have to start again to win this game. Finally we did, so, boys, well done.\"",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes told BBC:",
      "\"We wanted to win, we got it. But the result wasn't the perfect one for us.",
      "\"The first one, it's a great goal from them. Unbelievable shot. But after we have to be more focused. In the second half, we can't concede another goal and let them have some belief.",
      "\"We have to kill the game. In the first half, we hand chances to make 3-0 but because when you get 2-0 in these kinds of games everyone wants to try to score and get their goal, sometimes we don't get the best decision for the team.",
      "\"After we did a great job to close the game.",
      "\"Our chance to win a trophy this season is the FA Cup and we have to give everything to get into the final. To make the season look not as bad as it's been, we have to try to win this trophy.\"",
      "Manchester United will now face the winners of the replay between Bristol City and Nottingham Forest in the fifth round.",
      "Swindon Town are next up at Rodney Parade for Newport County in League Two on Saturday February 3.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United play Wolves back in the Premier League on Thursday February 1."

      "The end of Tottenham's bid for a cup success under Ange Postecoglou this season also signals the start of the business end of their Premier League campaign to achieve a top-four finish. While Postecoglou has played down suggestions of a 'target' in his first term in charge, with no cup football Spurs have plenty in their favour to push for Champions League qualification.",
      "Heung-Min Son's absence was felt in that 1-0 defeat to Manchester City, where Spurs uncharacteristically managed just one shot at home. But James Maddison's return from injury brings hope the team can recapture the better form they have shown this year.",
      "It was a chastening comeback for Spurs' creator - Maddison had just six touches during his 18 minutes on the field before Nathan Ake's 88th-minute winner for City - but a role from the start beckons against Brentford on Wednesday.",
      "Two of his five Premier League assists this season came in the opening weekend away game at Brentford and it is fitting his season restarts in earnest against those same opponents. Spurs fans will hope for a similar output from the summer signing who quickly became a key figure at the club before his three months out with an ankle injury.",
      "Tactically, a first pairing with Rodrigo Bentancur intrigues, but with Son still away on international duty, Spurs will be looking for leadership and some magic from Maddison.Peter Smith",
      "Almost imperceptibly, Manchester City, the reigning Premier League, European, and now world champions, have accumulated seven consecutive victories in all competitions. It has become almost trite to note their capacity to 'go on a run' but here we are.",

      "The City head coach said recently that De Bruyne and Haaland do not necessarily help his team to play better football - he has Rodri and Bernardo Silva for that - but they do help his team to win matches. It is all beginning to look a little ominous in the title race.",
      "Ominous sums up the situation for Vincent Kompany as he returns to City with Burnley. Two of their next three after this are against Liverpool and Arsenal but now eight points from safety there are no free hits at this stage. A favour from his old club? Not likely.Adam Bate",
      "The notion you do not win anything with kids has long been quashed and when Liverpool and Chelsea meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley next month the point will be underlined.",
      "The academy graduates have been delivering for Liverpool this season. Assists for Conor Bradley (aged 20) and James McConnell (19) against Norwich in the FA Cup on Sunday caught the eye, while Jarell Quansah's (21) assurance at centre-back is almost a given now.",
      "Bobby Clark (18), Kaide Gordon (19) and Owen Beck (21) stepped off the bench in the previous Premier League game at Bournemouth, with the former trusted to help see out the Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Fulham last week. The number of players currently aged 21 or under used by Jurgen Klopp this season is now at a staggering total of 13.",
      "Chelsea are just one behind, with Cole Palmer (21), their standout starlet this term. However, while much has been made of their expensively recruited young players, homegrown Alfie Gilchrist (20) was among their better performers in the FA Cup tie with Aston Villa on Friday night.",

      "A new year and a new start for Kalvin Phillips. After just 31 appearances in two-and-a-half seasons at Manchester City, he will hope to play a major role for West Ham. In fact he could go a long way to matching that number of games in the remainder of this campaign, should he help the Hammers go far in the Europa League.",
      "The new chapter starts at home to Bournemouth on Thursday and in his interviews since his arrival Phillips has looked like a player with renewed enthusiasm for the game and the fresh challenge ahead for him. The encouraging comments from David Moyes about his quality will have boosted his confidence and given him belief he can be a central figure in east London.",
      "It seems like a perfect fit, with the Hammers looking for a player to bring energy and quality on the ball in the middle of the park following Declan Rice's departure. Euro 2024 is an obvious target for Phillips but becoming an influence at the heart of a Premier League club is his more immediate goal.

      "Monday 29 January 2024 15:53, UK",
      "Our tipster Jones Knows' best bets are back from a winter break and ready to punish the bookmakers once more. He is eyeing up a 8/1 treble this midweek.",
      "The best bets column is back from a winter break, fully motivated to get the profit and loss column bouncing in the right direction. This column will live and die by the mantra of \"whatever I tip, I'll be backing - we're in this together\" and my betting activity has grinded to a halt in the last month.",
      "Such was the relentless pace of fixtures over the Christmas period where it was admittedly very difficult to keep up with all the Premier League action while juggling a family, I decided any potential bets advised through the Prediction column didn't quite meet the standards required to officially make it a selection. I then was off for most of January, taking the second half of my paternity leave after the birth of my second child. It was time to concentrate on spending time as a family before Mrs Jones Knows heads back to work.",
      "I don't know how we're going to cope, either.",
      "But for now I've had enough of soft play centres, tantrums, toilet training and being showered by the newborn's reflux tendencies. The Premier League really starts to motor in the next month. There will be angles to attack, big prices to roar home. Shower us with winners, please.",
      "Let's get back to business.",
      "We hit the crossbar with a few of these treble attempts in 2023, so we're due a bit of luck in getting one over the line. All three selections look to have fantastic chances of landing at inflated prices to what my tissue makes them.",
      "Both Fulham and Everton are struggling for inspiration in the final third. Fulham have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League games with their overall goal haul this season very misleading considering 16 of their 28 Premier League goals this season (57 per cent) were scored in a four-game run in November and December. Eight of their last 12 games would have seen both teams to score 'no' backers cop a return while 62 per cent of their Premier League matches this season have also followed that route.",
      "Meanwhile, Everton are the both teams to 'no' kings with 66 per cent of their Premier League matches seeing that particular angle land, including nine of their last 13 games across all competitions.",
      "Luton's corners remain an exciting angle. After winning seven vs Chelsea, they won 11 in the FA Cup third round clash with Bolton before racking up eight at Burnley - it was only the second time in 37 games that Burnley have conceded eight or more corners in a home game under Vincent Kompany. They then went to Bolton for the replay and won nine before racking up seven against Everton on Saturday. The corner aggregate score over those five fixtures reads Luton 42-16 Opposition. They can win five at home to Brighton, no problem.",
      "The treble can be landed by Curtis Jones against Chelsea, where his shots prices look very tasty.",
      "His all-action performances that are proving to be the glue that knits the side together are leading to a huge spike in his attacking output since returning from injury in December, especially at Anfield. In his last five starts in home matches, Jones has had 19 shots, 10 of them on target and scored five goals. He epitomises what this new-look Liverpool are all about.",
      "It's most certainly worth chancing Luton's corner count hitting the higher lines. If they maintain their current 8.4 average over the last five games then the 15/2 on offer for them to win eight or more corners also could look rather big in hindsight.",
