      "Bruno Fernandes has revealed he is determined to stay at Manchester United but only if they make him feel wanted. The club skipper, however, sensationally admitted he would be open to three moves elsewhere, with a reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo. in Saudi Arabia a notable omission.",
      "The 31-year-old said this week that he was hurt by the club after claiming they 'wanted' to sell him back in the summer. The comments from the Portuguese star, who had attracted serious interest from Saudi Arabia, have sparked fresh speculation around his future at the club.",
      "And Fernandes' telling remarks on Wednesday evening will no doubt stoke the flames even more, admitting that he would be open to moves to Spain, Italy and Portugal.",
      "However, he made it clear that his priority is to remain at United, but only on the condition that they show him love. In an open interview with Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, Fernandes said of his future: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired.\"",
      "He then went on to reveal that he has thought about life after United, naming his preferred next destinations. \"I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy. My daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal. The first option would be Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting but I don’t want to ruin the image that was left. I don’t want to drag myself there, I want to add to it.",
      "\"And even try district football, at an advanced age. You play in the district for love, you feel different. I have friends in the district.\"",
      "The 30-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. In the summer, Fernandes was courted by Al-Hilal but decided to reject the deal and stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Al-Hilal were said to have offered Fernandes a staggering £700,000 per week, a deal that would have netted him close to £200 million over three years. He has also remained in close touch with Ronaldo and been linked with his team, Al-Nassr.",
      "Despite the riches on offer in the Middle East, the United star clearly finds the appeal of top-flight European football more appealing.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has once again been United's standout player this season and scored a remarkable free-kick in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday night. Despite Fernandes playing a key role in the team's progression under Amorim, he hit out at the club he has called home for the past five years.",
      "“Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be,” he said. “I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“ Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.\"",
      "However, Fernandes' remarks stand in stark contrast to United's stance, with the club maintaining that they had assured Fernandes over the summer he was integral to their plans and not for sale.",
      "Fernandes is under contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2027, and the club have the option to extend it for a further year. He has scored a staggering 103 goals and registered 93 assists in his 307 games over the course of his near-six-year stint at United.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly launched an inquiry into how Ruben Amorim’s plans to tweak his system leaked out on the day of the Bournemouth game. United's head coach has favoured a three-man defence since his move from Sporting to Old Trafford in November 2024.",
      "However, he made a slight adjustment during Monday night's 4-4 draw at home to the Cherries, with Diogo Dalot moving from his usual wing-back position on the left to a traditional full-back role in a four-man defence.",
      "Nevertheless, word of this change was leaked on Monday afternoon, reportedly causing concern at United that Bournemouth may have been given advance notice of their strategy on the day of the match.",
      "The Mail now claim that United are committed to identifying the source of the leak to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future. A club spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "A concerned Amorim was asked about the change post-match on Monday and chose to turn the question back onto the media.",
      "He said: \"That is for you to discuss, not for me. I know that you guys know that I trained this week with a back four. I don't know how, but that is a good thing for you guys to discuss this week.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Monday's incident is not the first involving leaks at the club under Amorim, with United said to have been ‘furious’ in September over reports that Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes is ‘unhappy’. United's team selection was also leaked well ahead of the Manchester derby in December 2024.",
      "Several other stories were leaked last season, including those over squad issues and team news, with United's hierarchy taking steps to identify the mole in the camp. Other managerial tenures at M16, under Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Jose Mourinho, were also plagued by leaks.",
      "United started well against Andoni Iraola's team on Monday, with Amad deservedly putting Amorim's men a goal ahead in the first half before they were pegged back by Antoine Semenyo's equaliser.",
      "Casemiro nodded United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner, before a quick-fire double at the start of the second half gave Bournemouth the lead. Fernandes then equalised with a stunning free-kick before Matheus Cunha put the Red Devils ahead again.",
      "But again, United could not hang on to their lead with Eli Junior Kroupi pulling the Cherries level once more. The hosts have now moved up to sixth in the top-flight table, with Bournemouth nudging themselves up to 13th.",
      "\"If you understand a little bit,\" Amorim said post-match. \"If you follow the club like I follow the Premier League for so long, you [know you] have not just the duty to try to win the games. The way you try to win the games is so important for the fans.",
      "\"Of course they are desperate to win, but also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford. Today was inspiring, I think, also because of Bournemouth. But in the end that's the feeling of frustration of not winning the game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim was spotted looking visibly irritated in the technical area during Manchester United's epic 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday evening. The 40-year-old manager vented his frustrations to his backroom team, specifically targeting Leny Yoro.",
      "In footage posted by a supporter on social media, Amorim could be seen gesturing wildly as he sat back down, before shouting in his native Portuguese: \"The ball has gone for half an hour, what is Leny doing?\". The exact moment during the match when this happened remains unclear.",
      "Earlier this month, Amorim suggested Yoro 'thinks too much' after the 20 year old appeared dejected on the substitutes' bench following his withdrawal in the 54th minute during United's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. \"I also spoke with him because he thinks too much,\" he said.",
      "\"He makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he's too young and he wants to do everything so well. He's growing with games and with setbacks, it's not easy for him as a young guy. He cannot give that [reaction] to the people, the way he came to the bench. He understands that but he was really frustrated.\"",
      "\"It shows he cares. He knows it wasn't his best game but he did some things well and I showed him that. He's fit and ready for the next challenge.\"",
      "Despite taking the lead three times at Old Trafford, United failed to secure a win. Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha netted goals in rapid succession, making it 4-3 with just 10 minutes left on the clock.",
      "Amad and Casemiro also scored, showcasing an improved offensive performance. However, the draw meant that United missed out on the opportunity to ascend to fifth place in the Premier League as their defensive weaknesses were laid bare.",
      "\"It's really disappointing, we are really disappointed,\" Amorim said post-match. \"Crazy game.",
      "\"It might look like we lost the two points in the second half but I think we lost them in the first half. We dominated and created so many chances. We had to go to half-time with a different result.",
      "\"In the end we deserved more. It was a fun game for everyone at home. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"And then, again, I think six minutes into the second half, similar to Nottingham [Forest], we lost the concentration and they scored two goals, but we managed to get back into the game.",
      "\"We score two goals again and then we have to finish the game. A throw-in in our possession, we need to think about, not to go again but to take calm and to close the game. In the end, it was a fun game.\"",

      "Manchester United face an \"impossible\" challenge to replace Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo whilst the pair are away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). That's according to former United defender Paul Parker, who reckons United have been handed a \"nightmare\" scenario with both Mbeumo and Amad - their only two senior right wing options - jetting off to the tournament this week.",
      "Mbeumo, 26, has made a strong impression at Old Trafford since his £65million plus add-ons transfer from Brentford in July, finding the net seven times in 17 outings for the Reds. Meanwhile, Amad, who has shifted back to right-wing back this season to make room for Mbeumo, has been crucial to Ruben Amorim's system since his arrival and netted the opening goal in Monday's 4-4 stalemate against Bournemouth.",
      "However, United will now be deprived of both Mbeumo and Amad for a minimum of the next two-and-a-half weeks. AFCON kicks off this Sunday, with Mbeumo's Cameroon taking to the pitch first on Wednesday, 24 December against Gabon, whilst Amad's Ivory Coast begins their campaign against Mozambique on the same day.",
      "However, if Cameroon and/or the Ivory Coast progress to the knockout stages, they wouldn't be available for United's clash with Leeds and could potentially miss additional fixtures, including the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton.",
      "The AFCON final is scheduled for Sunday, January 18, which means Mbeumo and Amad could miss up to eight United games should their respective countries reach the final.",
      "United manager Amorim will need to find a solution to cope without Mbeumo and Amad for the foreseeable future - a task that pundit Parker believes will be extremely challenging.",
      "Parker told MyBettingSites.co.uk: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Amad aren't the only United players missing due to AFCON. Noussair Mazraoui is another, with the full-back set to represent Morocco at the tournament.",

      "Manchester United are ready to launch a move to sign Antoine Semenyo in January - and they already have plans for where he'd play. Bournemouth star Semenyo was among eight different goalscorers during Monday's rip-roaring 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.",
      "The 25-year-old forward ended a barren run of seven Bournemouth games without a goal, having enjoyed a prolific start to the season. Semenyo scored six times and provided three assists in the Cherries' opening eight matches to follow on from an impressive 2024-25 campaign.",
      "His exploits for Andoni Iraola's side have piqued the interest of multiple Premier League clubs, with Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham also linked. And it's enquiries from those rivals that could spring United into action.",
      "The Independent report that United are prepared to sign Semenyo during the winter transfer window, if their competitors make a move. The Red Devils, who are making plans for another big-spending summer, are reportedly confident that they can win the race for the London-born Ghana international, despite their lack of European football this season.",
      "Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, but there's a catch. It must be triggered by January 15 in order for the Cherries to have sufficient time to sign a replacement before the window closes on February 3.",
      "Ruben Amorim is said to be a fan of the ex-Bristol City star's tactical versatility and United can imagine him playing at left wing-back with Amad on the right. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Amorim described Semenyo as a 'special player'.",
      "Semenyo, it's added, is open to moving to Old Trafford next month. Until then, he's focussed on helping Bournemouth recover their form after extending their winless run to seven games.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.\"",
      "Semenyo could the next cab off the rank at Bournemouth, with the Cherries having sold Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi for a combined £150million last summer. \"When they all left, there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club,\" he said.",
      "\"But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.",
      "\"I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",

      "Manchester United have no intention of parting ways with Bruno Fernandes, despite renewed speculation about his future at Old Trafford. Last summer, Fernandes turned down an offer from Saudi Arabia, but his future has once again become a hot topic following the release of an interview with the Portuguese midfielder.",
      "In a chat with Canal 11, Fernandes hinted that United were open to him moving to Al-Hilal during the summer transfer window. The United skipper also suggested that the club's board lacked the \"courage\" to make the decision on his behalf.",
      "Fernandes went on to say: \"From the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all.\"",
      "However, club insiders have reiterated that the management was clear throughout the summer that Fernandes was integral to their future plans. They pointed to his own statement from an October sit-down with Manchester-based reporters, where he claimed that the club shared Ruben Amorim's wish for him to stay.",
      "Last summer, United contemplated signing Carlos Baleba. Brighton slapped a hefty price tag of over £100million on the midfielder, and United prioritised bolstering other areas of their squad.",
      "They have also kept tabs on Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton. Casemiro's contract is set to run out at the end of this season. While there is an option for a 12-month extension, activating it would mean the 33-year-old remains the top earner in the dressing room.",
      "Despite expectations that Casemiro will depart once his contract ends, he has become a key figure for Amorim this season, sparking rumours that he might stay on at United.",
      "United are looking to beef up their midfield when the season concludes. The Reds were satisfied with not bringing in a midfielder last summer as the club chiefs were confident that the existing options were robust enough to secure European football.",
      "Fernandes' contract is due to expire in 2027, with an option to extend it by another year. He has 103 goals and 93 assists in 307 games for the club and has been captain since July 2023, when Erik ten Hag decided to replace Harry Maguire as skipper.",

      "The data is part of the fifth edition of insurance intermediary group Howden's Men's European Football Injury Index. The report not only focuses on last season, when United had their worst campaign in 50 years, but also reflects on the past five years. During this time, United, along with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, incurred above-average injury costs.",
      "After United's £155m came Chelsea on £137m and Manchester City on £104m. Injury cost is determined by a player's daily wage during their period of injury. As such, the absence of a high-earning key player results in higher costs than a few squad players on lower wages.",
      "United's most expensive season in the period was the 2023/24 campaign, which resulted in a cost of £45.28million. The club fared better last season, with injury costs just under £28m, according to the study.",
      "The lowest injury cost for United, a mere £14.5m, occurred during the 2020/21 season, when they finished second in the Premier League under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Over the recent five-year period, United suffered a total of 399 injuries, averaging nearly 80 per season.",
      "Chelsea followed with 359 injuries, while Newcastle recorded 355. Despite their on-field struggles, United's injury tally last season actually fell to 68, the lowest figure during the period.",
      "The research, which also examined the top divisions in Germany, Spain, Italy and France, documented 22,596 injuries at a cost of nearly £3billion over the five-year period. Premier League clubs accounted for 24 per cent of the injuries but bore 40 per cent of the costs, highlighting the financial gap between the English top flight and its European rivals.",
      "While costs have generally risen, the number of injuries has remained steady and, in some instances, even declined. However, there has been a rise in injury severity, particularly among players under the age of 21.",
      "This has been linked to players' increasingly demanding schedules. Elite Football Performance and Injury Risk Expert, Dr Robin Thorpe, a former Man United consultant, said: \"A concerning signal is the near 30 per cent increase in injury severity, indicating that players who do become injured are missing substantially more time.",
      "\"This rise in severity aligns with reduced recovery windows, cumulative fatigue, and the increasing density and sequencing of elite competition for a selection of teams.",
      "\"The vulnerability of young players is particularly striking. Across the top leagues, most notably in the Premier League, under-21 players sustain the most severe injuries despite accumulating the fewest minutes.",
      "\"This may point toward a systemic issue within player development pathways. In many cases, players may reach technical readiness for senior football before achieving the physical robustness required to tolerate its demands.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been accused of influencing Simon Hooper’s decision after Manchester United benefited from a contentious free-kick against Bournemouth. Fernandes made it 3-3 on Monday night with a stunning free-kick after Bournemouth captain Adam Smith had been penalised for handball.",
      "In an action-packed match at Old Trafford which finished 4-4, the call to award United a free-kick wasn’t the main talking point. However, it did enrage Bournemouth, with manager Andoni Iraola saying: “I think it's a clear mistake. Above the armband. It's not a foul.”",
      "The ball was struck into Smith’s arm from point-blank range but Hooper awarded a free-kick and booked the Cherries skipper for dissent after Fernandes found the top corner. Michael Owen believes that Hooper decided to give the decision, only after being influenced by Fernandes.",
      "“The pace, dip, everything, it was a fabulous free-kick – but it should never have been one,” the former striker said of Fernandes’ free-kick on Premier League Productions.",
      "“It was a foot away from him, even if it hits him down low, when you kick it into someone when you’re only a yard away then it’s very harsh, his arms weren’t flailing and it was too high anyway. It was a really poor decision.",
      "“Little things make so much difference. People don’t want to see people exaggerating a fall or claiming a free-kick when it isn’t… if Bruno Fernandes doesn’t really go mad when that ball hits he never gets it. The referee thinks, ‘oh, I didn’t see it properly, I’ll give it’, because of the reaction of the player, it’s a human reaction.",
      "“These little things make a massive difference. If Bruno doesn’t do that, if he’s not living on the edge and being a little bit naughty, then they don’t get that [free-kick] and they don’t score that goal. These little, I was going to say dark arts but it’s a bit strong… he was streetwise, let’s say, in winning that free-kick.”",
      "Smith was absolutely furious with the call. He said: “We conceded a sloppy goal straight before half-time which angered us and that showed. As soon as we came out for the second half, we scored (twice) straight away.",
      "“Then, surprise, surprise, the referee gives not a great decision because it hit my shoulder from one yard, so what am I meant to do with my arms? I don’t know. He didn’t even want to talk to me, which is even more disappointing. Even the Man United players said it wasn’t handball!",
      "“As a defender I just do not know what to do anymore. It’s one yard. It’s actually not even one yard – it’s right next to me! It’s hit this [top of sleeve]. I thought this wasn’t handball any more?",
      "“He didn’t even want to speak to me. He said ‘I don’t want to talk to you right now’. Then he booked me after the goal. It’s really frustrating, really frustrating.”",

      "Arsenal will win the Premier League four points clear of Manchester City by season's end, if the latest supercomputer prediction rings true. Mikel Arteta's Gunners managed a scrappy 2-1 win over Wolves at the weekend in a match that was filled with late drama.",
      "Sam Johnstone put Arsenal ahead by putting the ball into the back of his own net after 70 minutes, before Tolu Arokodare equalised for the visitors on the 90 minute mark. While Rob Edwards then looked set to take a point from his side's endeavours at the Emirates Stadium, fate had other plans for the encounter.",
      "However, if the predictions made by Aceodds' supercomputer, BETSiE, ring true, that gap will widen ever so slightly come the end of the current campaign. According to the number-crunching piece of software, Arsenal will finish their season with 81 points, and have been handed a 67.7% chance of winning the league.",
      "If correct, it would see the North London outfit clinch their first league title in over two decades - their last coming in the form of Arsene Wenger's remarkable 2003/04 'Invincibles' campaign. BETSiE also believes that City will accrue 77 points (76.7 rounded up) for their efforts this season, with their probability of winning the league standing at just 28.5%.",
      "It will come as a tough pill to swallow for Guardiola if correct, considering the Spaniard demands excellence from his side, having clinched six top flight titles, nine domestic cups and a Champions League during his nine-year tenure to date.",
      "Despite a mix-bag of results this term after a summer of spending, defending champions Liverpool are predicted to finish third in the league by BETSiE come the end of the season, with a total of 67 points (67.3 rounded down). It's a stark contrast to the position that Arne Slot currently finds his team in, given they sit seventh in the standings as a result of eight wins, two draws and six losses.",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United, meanwhile, are predicted to miss out on automatic Champions League qualification for 2026/27 if the software is accurate. BETSiE currently has the Red Devils down to finish fifth in the Premier League a point clear of a high-flying Aston Villa; again, a polar opposite state of affairs to last season's lacklustre 15th place end to the season.",
      "To come to the predictions, BETSiE simulated the league seasons 100,000 times. The supercomputer takes into account all match results from this pre-season and the current season, projecting the the season based on both pre-season expectations, fixture difficulty and xG earned both for and against during the season.",
      "It now also integrates team financial data and player values from Transfermarkt. This additional layer of data provides a more nuanced understanding of team capabilities and potential performance variations.",

      "Manchester United bosses insist they told Bruno Fernandes during the summer that he remained central to the club's long-term vision. Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal tabled an enormous financial package in a bid to entice Fernandes away from Old Trafford.",
      "Nevertheless, no official discussions took place with United and Fernandes turned down their advances. Fernandes addressed that choice in October, revealing that the manager and the club made it clear they wanted him to remain.",
      "However, Fernandes now appears to have contradicted those comments during a chat with Canal 11, the subscription television channel of the Portuguese Football Federation.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, he revealed: \"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay.",
      "\"Also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'.",
      "\"It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all.\"",
      "During that chat, Fernandes explained: \"The manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project. He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like 'Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project', or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "The discussion was organised ahead of his milestone 300th outing for United. When quizzed about whether he'd spoken to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, Fernandes confirmed: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was already in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him, 'look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said, 'we won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"And then from there on, I spoke with the manager also. I said, 'look, this is what I have, this is the offers that I have on the table'. Obviously, I said to him, I have to think about if the club says, 'we want you to go, because we want to get a different player. We need money to get more players or whatever'.",
      "\"That was not the case from the club. They always said to me that they will buy, they will reinforce the team. They wanted players. The manager said to me, like, 'no, we want more players to help you to become a better team.",
      "\"So we don't want you to go, because then if we bring some people and then we lose you, we're still going to lose something'. So more or less, that was the conversation between all of us.\"",
      "Fernandes' contract with United is set to run out in 2027, but there's the possibility of a 12-month extension.",

      "Almost forgotten in the aftermath of such a breathless carnival of goals and misses was a refereeing decision that could go down as one of the worst of the season. Certainly according to Bournemouth players, that is.",
      "Old Trafford on Monday night was a tough gig for Simon Hooper. It was fast, it was frenetic, it had its usual quota of player con-artistry.",
      "If Hooper got the odd thing wrong, it was understandable. And even though he could have dismissed Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo for grabbing Diogo Dalot, the Manchester United man’s initial offence - the dangerously sly shove on an airborne player that could cause serious injury - made Hooper’s leniency more understandable.",
      "What was not understandable, though, was how Hooper adjudged Adam Smith to have handled at point-blank range when the ball clearly hit the powerless Bournemouth captain high on the bicep - in fact, more like his shoulder. He was no more than a yard away.",
      "It was an unfathomable decision - one that Hooper thought he did not need to explain to Smith but one that, according to the Cherries man, United players considered a gift. After dramatically taking a 3-2 lead early in the second half, Bournemouth appeared to have taken the sting out of United and calmed the game down.",
      "But along came Hopper’s handball decision, a wonderful free-kick from Fernandes and proceedings erupted again, Matheus Cunha putting United ahead before Eli Junior Kroupi’s final equaliser. But after such a tumultuous night, it was Hooper’s harshness that will stick with Smith.",
      "He said: “We conceded a sloppy goal straight before half-time which angered us and that showed. As soon as we came out for the second half, we scored (twice) straight away.",
      "“Then - surprise, surprise - the referee gives not a great decision because it hit my shoulder from one yard, so what am I meant to do with my arms? I don’t know.",
      "“He didn’t even want to talk to me, which is even more disappointing. Even the Man United players said it wasn’t handball!",
      "“As a defender I just do not know what to do anymore. It’s one yard. It’s actually not even one yard - it’s right next to me! It’s hit this [top of sleeve]. I thought this wasn’t handball any more?",
      "“He didn’t even want to speak to me. He said “I don’t want to talk to you right now”. Then he booked me after the goal. It’s really frustrating, really frustrating.”",
      "And while United’s attacking display in the eight-goal draw has won a lot of praise, Smith - who has been at Bournemouth for over a decade - reckons it was Andoni Iraola’s side who should have claimed all three points. Smith went on: “We should have won. I was honestly gutted not to win.",
      "\"The way United play is really tough to play against. On the other hand, on the counter ,you can really, really punish them.”",
      "Iraola’s side have now gone seven Premier League matches without a win, losing four of those. But Smith feels that record is another an inaccurate reflection of their form.",
      "He said: “It’s been little things that have gone against us. Against United, we are winning and that decision goes against me and the team. Little things like that can swing games. Sometimes you need a bit of luck and if we keep playing like that I’m sure we can climb up the table.”",

      "Perhaps Casemiro had an early sight of the T-shirt worn by Kobbie Mainoo’s brother and deliberately got himself booked. Or perhaps the seasoned Brazilian midfielder just fancied a couple of days off before Christmas. The old trick.",
      "Either way, Casemiro’s yellow card, making him unavailable for Sunday’s trip to Villa Park, should, indeed, Free Kobbie Mainoo. If the 20-year-old England midfielder is not given his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday, then he really has to push for a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "But - and it is a big ‘but’ - the club’s hierarchy is under no obligation whatsoever to let Mainoo go, whether Ruben Amorim has him in his next line-up or not. It is not as if he is a massive drain on finances and his modest contract has a year and a half to run.",
      "The suggestion is that Mainoo wants more game-time so he can make a case for going to the World Cup with England. But, harsh as it may sound, that is not of any concern to Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "The second half of this season could make or break Amorim’s Old Trafford tenure. With no European commitments - and with the overall standard of the Premier League not exceptional - there are no excuses if United fail to secure a Champions League place for next season. None at all.",
      "So, if Amorim believes Mainoo might be of use to him in any way in the second half of this season, then he is entitled to keep him. And, even though most of us believe a parting of the ways would be best all round, Mainoo will have to get on with it.",
      "His brother’s T-shirt is a sideshow Kobbie could really do without. It has nothing to do with the player himself, let’s get that straight.",
      "No-one could question Mainoo’s professionalism. Absolutely not. No-one could accuse Mainoo of feeling he is entitled to a regular starting place. Absolutely not.",
      "It is clear, though, that some do, and Kobbie’s brother is not alone. But what Mainoo needs to do is prove himself to Amorim, who is going nowhere.",
      "Last season, the United manager gave Mainoo 12 Premier League starts and United won only two of those matches, losing eight and drawing two. In the second of those two wins, United were a goal down to Southampton at half-time and Amorim replaced Mainoo. United went on to win 3-1.",
      "In Mainoo’s last six Premier League starts, United have lost five and drawn one. He did well when coming on for the last half-hour or so of the remarkable draw with Bournemouth but did not stand out.",
      "Despite the hypercritical views of pundits such as Paul Scholes, there are no obvious signs of Amorim keeping Mainoo on the fringes because he is not convinced about his character. He is simply not convinced Mainoo is one of the best midfielders at the club.",
      "Odd as it may seem to those of us who watched his emergence and were full of admiration for his maturity, composure and brilliance, that is Amorim’s prerogative. And right now, his view is the one that matters.",
      "Mainoo should not take any flak for his brother’s daft T-shirt stunt. But it is time to roll up his sleeves and - if the manager allows him to - prove his worth to United.",

United would have earned £100m for their 31-year-old captain and the Portuguese playmaker has - for the first time - suggested that, while Ruben Amorim wanted him to stay, the club's hierarchy were keen to cash in.",
      "\"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia,” Fernandes told Canal 11 in quotes carried by Maisfutebol via Sport Witness.",

I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",

He is under contract with United, where he has 103 goals and 93 assists in 307 games, until June 2027, but the club has the option to extend it.",
      "“Obviously, I know it was tough on the club to decide that because it was a big amount of money that the club hasn’t got probably since Cristiano [Ronaldo] left, he was the last one where they got so much money for a player.",
      "“I know for the club it was tough to decide. Because on one side I’m the club captain, I’m important for them, even if at times I’ve not been great, I’ve been performing and everything. I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong. But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever.

      "Amorim said: \"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Ethan Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The 21-year-old joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has played 20 games. The right-winger has already contributed four goals and two assists during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Midfielder Dan Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore, 21, has been important for Rotherham in midfield, featuring in 26 games across all competitions for the League One side as one of their best players.",
      "Left-sided defender Harry Amass has been a regular since joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season. Amorim was likely referencing Wednesday's off-field troubles, with the club having been hit with a 12-point deduction, as opposed to Amass' own performances during his controversial press conference.",
      "Amass has made 16 appearances in the Championship and scored his first senior goal against Southampton. Wednesday want to extend the 18-year-old left-back's loan until the end of the season, suggesting they are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Having missed the first two games of the League Two season with a minor injury, Elyh Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England's Under-20s duty in September. Since his absence in September, another young goalkeeper has come into the side and earned first-choice status over the 19-year-old Harrison.",
      "Joe Hugill started the first two games of the campaign for Barnet in League Two but his season was derailed by an injury and he did not play until earlier this month. The 22-year-old striker came off the bench to face Bristol Rovers and played another seven minutes of football in the defeat to Chesterfield.",
      "Centre-back Sonny Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign for Notts County and notched a goal but he lost his starting role towards the end of September. The 20-year-old has been left out of the matchday squad for the majority of the games since.",
      "Toby Collyer, meanwhile, is back at United recovering from an injury after making 12 appearances on loan at West Bromwich Albion. The central midfielder, 21, appeared in each of West Brom’s first nine games of the season but has since been in and out of the side due to a muscular problem.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Louis Jackson started in their first two games of the season but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back, 20, has been absent from their last eight matchday squads.",
      "Enzo Kana-Biyik, 18, scored his first senior goal in October when he salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break. The centre-forward has played a total of 13 games for the Swiss side, mainly as a substitute.",
      "Radek Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping seven clean sheets. The 22-year-old Czech has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.\"",
      "Jack Moorhouse has made 18 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient but just five of those have been league starts. Yet, the 20-year-old midfielder has shown glimpses of his quality coming off the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Habeeb Ogunneye in United's academy, recently left Newport County. That has impacted Ogunneye's role in the squad after the 20-year-old right-back’s strong start, having played 21 matches and scored once, with him being absent from the last two matchday squads.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Ethan Wheatley, 19, needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 19 appearances in League One for Northampton and has found the back of the net three times, while also recording three assists in all competitions.",
      "Ethan Williams is performing well north of the border. The 21-year-old winger has contributed a goal and three assists in 14 appearances in the Scottish Premiership for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting seventh in the table. He has not been included in the last four matchday squads, however.",

      "Manchester United pair Amad and Bryan Mbeumo signed off before leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations with very different nights in the 4-4 thriller against Bournemouth. United boss Ruben Amorim may have been hoping for a simple home win before losing the trio - and defender Noussair Mazraoui - to the tournament in Morocco, but what he got was something far more bombastic.",
      "Three times United led at Old Trafford against Andoni Iraola's men. Having led 2-1 at half-time they fell behind within five minutes of the second half starting and their 41 year record of not losing a home game having been in front at the break looked in serious danger. Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha put them in front, before Junior Kroupi equalised for the Cherries who were then denied a famous victory in extra-time by two stellar Senne Lammens saves.",
      "Amad struck the opening goal for United on the night, being in the right place at the right time to turn home into an empty net from close range. Unfortunately for the 23 year-old, his attempted challenge inadvertently played the ball to Kroupi for Bournemouth's late leveller.",
      "But in between, he was perhaps the biggest personification of Amorim loosening the shackles on his side. From his now familiar position of wing-back, the Ivory Coast international flew forward with abandon, teasing and troubling the Bournemouth backline and looking threatening throughout a first period where United largely dominated, created chances and looked likely winners.",
      "In the second period, as United chased the game and Amorim changed to a back four, Amad was pushed higher, into the right-wing position he perhaps craves more than anything else as United moved into something more akin to a 4-2-4, Mbeumo partnering a returning Benjamin Sesko in attack and Matheus Cunha operating from the left.",
      "Asked about the formation post-match, Amad admitted: “We work depending on the opponent, when sometimes we play as a 4-4-2, sometimes we play as a 3-4-3, sometimes also we play 4-3-3, maybe people outside don’t see. As a team, we can change.",
      "“But the system doesn't matter for us. Today, [the focus] was to win this game, so we are really disappointed. You can see straight away in the dressing room, everyone was very disappointed because we know as a team, we can do much better.\"",
      "Cunha, who scored United's fourth, was arguably the man of the match, with his running power and ability to drive through the thirds. But it was Amad to whom United consistently turned to create chances, with his trickery causing Bournemouth untold troubles whether United were in front or behind from that right side. He was at the top of his game and losing his talent to AFCON is problematic.",
      "Losing Mbeumo, who has shone since his £71million move from Brentford, is also a problem. But the Cameroon international was well below his best, a rushed thrash from eight yards that saw the ball rocket into the Stretford End rather than the back of the net summing up his night.",
      "It wasn't a surprise to see him hooked late on when Joshua Zirkzee was called upon.",
      "Regardless of Mbeumo's individual failures, Amorim's tactical change - going to a back four, moving Mbeumo centrally and pushing Amad higher - caused Bournemouth problems. United fans chanted \"attack, attack\" and Amorim gave them what they wanted. Iraola admitted his side \"suffered\" while Amorim, when asked whether United were playing with four at the back at times, said: \"That is for you to discuss, not for me. I know you guys know we trained this week with a back four.\"",
      "In September, after the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, Amorim claimed he would not change his philosophy and that \"if they [United hierarchy] want it changed, you change the man.\" But perhaps that promise has now been broken. Because this United looked far different from the usually prosaic, tightly-wound group we usually see for whom the system has been king these past 13 months.",
      "In that same press conference as Amorim stood defiant when his 3-4-3 formation was questioned, he also insisted: \"I will play my way until I want to change. \"",
      "That time may well have arrived. Unfortunately, if indeed it has, he must find a way to make it work without his flexible friend, Amad, for the next month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes was absolutely fuming with Manchester United’s wide-open defence after they surrendered three leads to draw against Bournemouth. An end-to-end match finished 4-4 at Old Trafford on Monday night, much to the frustration of the United captain.",
      "Amad Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes and Matheus Cunha all found the back of Bournemouth’s net, but their impressive attack only yielded one point. Antoine Semenyo, Evanilson, Marcus Tavernier and Junior Krupi all breached United’s leaky defence to score past Senne Lammens.",
      "Luke Shaw was robbed of possession for Bournemouth’s first goal, the second came after United surrendered possession from a throw-in, the third from a free-kick conceded by Casemiro on the edge of the box and the fourth after the defence was carved open once again. Lammens then had to be alert to save from David Brooks as the away side nearly clinched it late on.",
      "The situation prompted an all-too-familiar reaction from Fernandes, whose passion was on show. After curling a stunning free-kick into the top corner from the edge of the box to make it 3-3, Fernandes waved his arms to the crowd, encouraging them to make noise.",
      "But it was his body language towards his own team-mates which particularly caught the eye. After Casemiro brought down Tavernier to end a dangerous Bournemouth counter-attack and earn himself a yellow card, responsibility fell on Fernandes to organise his team.",
      "A clip of Fernandes gesturing to Lammens to move across the goal before Tavernier’s free-kick has gone viral on social media. In it, Michael Owen explains what Fernandes is trying to say to his goalkeeper.",
      "Owen said on Premier League Productions: “Look at Bruno there telling his goalkeeper: ‘Get across, get across! We’ve already got this side of the goal locked off – this is the side of the goal you need to protect’.” Lammens hesitated and Tavernier’s strike flew in between the gap between Fernandes and Cunha and into the bottom corner.",
      "After the final whistle, Fernandes hadn’t cooled off. He was filmed from the stands looking dejected in the centre circle as players went around clapping the Old Trafford supporters. The Portuguese playmaker spoke to Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro and appeared to be remonstrating about the problems in the United side by waving his arms and shrugging his shoulders.",
      "United fans on Reddit, where the clip was posted, have speculated that Fernandes was angrily trying to demonstrate the wide-open gaps in the team’s defence. “Clearly gesturing why the CB gaps are so wide. Such a shame because we were so fluid in attack,” one fan wrote.",
      "Another wrote: “If you watch the game back they weren't even wide, it's just each centre back had no idea where they were supposed to be running when going back or which player they should follows. ESPECIALLY obvious on their 4th goal.”",
      "Ruben Amorim hinted at something similar in his post-match analysis. “It does seem [like] a lot of good things, but a lot of things to work [on]. We are not winning games sometimes in the details,” he said.",
      "“It's not about because it's a back four, back three, back five. It’s the details that we need to work [on to] understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because, again, today it’s against a very good team. We created so many chances to win the game, we should have won the three points.”",

      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has lauded head coach Ruben Amorim for \"doing the right thing\" during their electrifying 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford. Goals from Amad and Casemiro gave United a 2-1 lead going into half-time, but the game's momentum swung back and forth in the second half.",
      "Shortly after play resumed, goals from Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier put the Cherries ahead. However, a quick-fire double from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha once again tipped the scales in United's favour. The excitement didn't end there, with Eli Junior Kroupi levelling the score at 4-4 in the 84th minute.",
      "Both teams had to be content with a point, but the match was a thrilling spectacle for both fans and neutrals. Neville praised both United and Bournemouth for their part in the game. He also highlighted a tactical adjustment made by head coach Amorim that added to the excitement",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, he said: \"It was a stunning watch - more for a neutral maybe, but even for me. I was really critical after the Everton and West Ham games because of just the nature of the performance - I thought it was really bland, the Everton one where obviously he kept three at the back and against one - they were down to 10 men; there was no urgency, they weren't throwing the kitchen sink at it. Same against West Ham, they let large parts of the game drift.",
      "\"It was the complete and utter opposite tonight, I can live with that all day long in terms of the performance and the standard because they played with real intent. Played the ball forwards, always played at full pace.",
      "\"We'll come onto the mistakes shortly, but I just feel that the way in which, also when United went 3-2 down, and Ruben Amorim then went to 4-4-2 and did the right thing. Forget the system, he did the right thing and he got the right players on the pitch and looked a massive threat.",
      "\"But credit to Bournemouth. In the first half, I thought they were overrun by United, I thought they were going to be out of the game, that it would probably be two or 3-0. But if you don't kill teams off - I think you said in the first half United had more shots than any other team this season recorded in the Premier League, which demonstrated their dominance.",
      "\"But still, Bournemouth had one or two good moments, as well, get their goal and are still in it at half-time. Jamie Carragher's words just coming out before the second half that Ruben Amorim will be thinking 'we should be further ahead in this game' - that's true.",
      "\"The second half was absolute mayhem. Absolute mayhem. But just generally in terms of sort of the fans would feel the same thing. There were boos after the Everton and West Ham game, there weren't boos after this game.",
      "\"There was disappointment, but there were a lot of fans we've just seen stay in the stadium to clap the team because they can live with that. If you're a kid coming to United - my two girls have come tonight - and they'll be thrilled walking back across that forecourt. They won't be happy United haven't won, but they'll have seen a great game of football, and that's what you come to Old Trafford for; you come for entertainment, of course you come to see your team win - I get it, you've got to win games, you've got to win trophies and titles, we can turn to this is sort of not good enough in respect to what happened.",
      "\"But they've got the entertainment bit right, their performance right, the style right. It's absolutely critical at this football club and I've enjoyed what I've seen tonight from those red shirts.\"",
      "One negative aspect of their display was the vulnerability shown at the back by United. Netting four goals yet failing to secure maximum points naturally raises questions about the defence, though Neville suggested this was hardly surprising considering the squad options.",
      "He continued: \"Defensively, I think it's to be expected. When you think that - Martinez came on, but De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez not playing, and obviously you've got a couple of younger defenders. It doesn't look like a defence that's going to keep clean sheets and keep teams out, it just doesn't look like that.",
      "\"So you think that before the game already they're probably going to score. I think I said just after half-time, they'll probably have to score four to win this game - and four wasn't enough, it needed to be five! Because both teams looked really vulnerable at the back and it was probably expected from United, obviously Bournemouth have been going through a rough patch.",
      "\"But I enjoyed the game so much, I can live watching those types of matches all the time. I can't stand 0-0's. They happen sometimes and they're a struggle and you respect, sort of, defensive solidity. But it can't have bland, letting games drift where teams are passing along the back - that was a proper game of football and I really enjoyed it.\"",

Both the Cherries and the Red Devils had led at one point during the game, with Eli Junior Kroupi scoring late on to secure a point for the visitors.",
      "And despite their fightback and the thrilling nature of the game, Iraola claims that United shouldn’t have even taken the lead in the first half. Amad had headed home to give his side the lead after a controversial free-kick was awarded for an apparent handball.",
      "And the Bournemouth boss believes that decision may have been wrong. Speaking after his side’s draw, the Spaniard said: \"I think it's a clear mistake. Above the armband. It's not a foul.",
      "\"We struggled in the first 15-20 minutes. We made some adjustments but we were losing 1-0. From there I was quite happy with how the game was.",
      "\"The last two were massive chances, great saves from Lammens. We take a point. We can use a lot of good things from today but things to correct.\"",
      "And while Iraola claimed that the refereeing mistake did not help his side’s cause, he has also pointed to Manchester United’s system causing them issues. The Bournemouth boss suggested that Ruben Amorim had slightly tweaked his approach, catching the south coast side off guard.",
      "He added: \"I think it is the same system they always play but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system. Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and, even us, we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this, and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Monday evening’s draw at Old Trafford leaves Bournemouth sitting 13th in the Premier League on 21 points ahead of this weekend’s clash with struggling Burnley. United in the meantime are sixth and two points off the top four ahead of taking on Aston Villa in their next outing.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has hinted that he could leave Manchester United soon. The 31-year-old midfielder said in a bombshell interview after United's 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday that the club wanted him to leave during the summer transfer window, amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Hilal were reported to have lodged a huge bid for Fernandes, but a deal never went through, with Ruben Amorim's side instead keeping their captain and playmaker. He has since impressed for United, scoring five goals and adding seven assists in 16 Premier League matches this season.",
      "The former Udinese man, who moved to the Reds in a £67.6million move from Sporting CP in February 2020, netted a stunning free-kick and grabbed one assist in United's draw with Bournemouth. Speaking post-match, Fernandes then stunned fans by revealing United tried to sell him - though the club insist they outlined he was a key part of their plans.",
      "Now, Fernandes has spoken in another interview with Portuguese channel Canal 11 and dissected his future, hinting he would be open to leaving United in the not-so-distant future if they don't show him enough love.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview, Fernandes told Canal 11: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired. I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy… my daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal… the first option would be Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting. But I don’t want to ruin the image that was left.",
      "\"But I don't want to drag myself there, I want to add to it. And even try district football, at an advanced age. You play in the district for love, you feel different. I have friends in the district.\"",
      "Despite the huge wages he could earn in Saudi, Fernandes had made it clear he is intent on staying in Europe should he ever leave United. The skipper has been a standout figure for Ruben Amorim once again this season and claimed that the manager wanted to keep him back in the summer.",
      "“I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me,\" he claimed.",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”",
      "Fernandes first moved to Italy in 2012 after signing for Novara. He spent a season there before moving to Serie A side Udinese, where he enjoyed a successful three-year spell.",
      "After scoring 11 times and adding 13 assists in 95 appearances for Udinese, he signed for Sampdoria in 2016. But Fernandes struggled to settle there and moved back to Portugal with Sporting CP a year later.",
      "Sporting is where Fernandes started to kick on, with the midfielder hitting his stride and posting some impeccable numbers in Primeira Liga. Although he spent just two-and-a-half years at the Lisbon club, Fernandes managed to record 63 goals and 50 assists in 137 games, winning three major trophies in the process.",
      "Fernandes joined United in the 2020 January transfer window and he has become a crucial member of the side since, scoring 103 goals and providing 93 assists in 307 appearances.",

      "Manchester United outlined to Bruno Fernandes in the summer that he was a key part of the club's future plans, following a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal to leave Old Trafford. Al-Hilal offered a huge financial package in an attempt to lure Fernandes away from Manchester. However, no formal contact was made with United and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, he said: \"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay.",
      "\"Also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'.",
      "\"It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all.\"",
      "United sources have reiterated that the leadership was clear throughout the summer that Fernandes was a key part of the future plans, pointing to his own quote from the sit-down with Manchester-based reporters in October, in which he claimed the club echoed Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay.",
      "During that interview, Fernandes said: \"The manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project. He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like ‘Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project’, or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "The interview was arranged ahead of his 300th appearance for United. Fernandes was asked whether he spoke to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, and he said: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was already in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him, 'look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said, 'we won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"And then from there on, I spoke with the manager also. I said, ‘look, this is what I have, this is the offers that I have on the table’. Obviously, I said to him, I have to think about if the club says, ‘we want you to go, because we want to get a different player. We need money to get more players or whatever’.",
      "\"That was not the case from the club. They always said to me that they will buy, they will reinforce the team. They wanted players. The manager said to me, like, ‘no, we want more players to help you to become a better team.",
      "\"So we don’t want you to go, because then if we bring some people and then we lose you, we’re still going to lose something’. So more or less, that was the conversation between all of us.\"",
      "Fernandes' contract at United expires in 2027, but there is the option of a 12-month extension.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has claimed the club wanted him to leave in the summer transfer window, amid links of a switch to Saudi Arabia.",
      "There were reports of a concrete move made by Al-Hilal for a big fee - but the deal never went through - as the Old Trafford giants kept hold of their captain and main playmaker.",
      "Speaking to Maisfutebol, he said on life at United, and those exit whispers: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny - after six years in Manchester with cold and rain - I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.",
      "\"I could have left like many people do and said; 'I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side'. But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",
      "\"But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like; 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "It's a surprising claim from the captain, who has been among those frustrated by United's lack of competitiveness over recent seasons. A move to Saudi Arabia could've brought an end to his stay at Old Trafford, which will hit the five-year mark over the next few weeks.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "Fernandes revealed he had prior links to Al-Hilal - the club who were most heavily rumoured with a move - before he turned them down. On the switch, he added: \"The president of Al-Hilal spoke to me. He called me directly. [Joao] Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me.",
      "\"They wanted him to play in the Club World Cup with Al-Hilal. It was a love that started back in the Jorge Jesus days, he had already called me in 2023.\"",
      "It's a surprising admission from Fernandes, just a few months on from the saga, as he continues to be an important part of the setup at United.",
      "The 31-year-old has 18 months remaining on his current deal, which expires in 2027 - although there is a club option of another year which can be triggered.",
      "It remains to be seen whether he will be keen to stay beyond that, particularly if those links with Al-Hilal appear again over the coming months, though he continues to be a player that Ruben Amorim relies on within his team.",
      "Fernandes has moved from a No.10 role into a deeper role this season, a switch that brought some criticism upon Amorim early on, but has since worked wonders.",
      "\"The frustration that he feels is because he wants to help a lot,\" the head coach said on his club captain earlier this season - as he hit the 300-appearance mark. \"The teammates sometimes it's not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here.",
      "\"He wants the responsibility all the time. He suffers a lot with the losses. Every time we don't win a game, you can feel it. He takes it personally, as he should as a captain. He is a great leader, a great footballer...\"",

      "Fans who entered Old Trafford to watch Manchester United against Bournemouth arrived wearing appropriate winter clothing. Some wore woolly hats and gloves, but Jordan Mainoo-Hames stood in a T-shirt.",
      "Mainoo-Hames braved the cold for a publicity stunt, wearing a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' black tee. The photo has gone viral, and Mainoo-Hames shared it with his 600,000 followers on Instagram.",
      "It's difficult to unite the entire United fanbase to agree on anything, but the 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' shirt stunt has managed to do so, going down like a lead balloon among supporters. Mainoo's half-brother - they share the same father - has become the story when everyone should be talking about what was probably the youngster's finest performance from the bench this season.",
      "To say the optics weren't good would be an understatement. What was Mainoo-Hames thinking with the stunt? He may have thought it was harmless fun, making light of a negative situation. The reality is that it looked like a Love Island contestant causing unnecessary commotion.",
      "Mainoo's family will understandably be frustrated on his behalf, but those frustrations should be vented behind closed doors, not inside Old Trafford when the world's eyes are watching.",
      "Amorim recently laughed at the suggestion that his substitutions were conservative and Mainoo should have been brought on against West Ham. He laughed because he had been asked about Mainoo again, however, it looked as if he was laughing at the idea that he would have been a good substitution.",
      "His response went viral on social media for the wrong reasons. Then Mainoo liked a post on Instagram from a media outlet that had posted the quotes with a surprised emoji. Mainoo subsequently unliked the post, presumably after a private word from a United communications staff member.",
      "That has been the only public sign of frustration from Mainoo this season. He has done everything he can to win a starting role again, working with private coaches during international breaks and changing his personal chef at home in an attempt to improve his game, but Amorim has continued to overlook him.",
      "Tom Heaton, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Mainoo are the only senior United players not to have started in the Premier League. Malacia was reintegrated in September after being placed in the 'bomb squad', Martinez has just returned from a 10-month injury lay-off and Heaton is 39 years old.",
      "There have been genuine reasons for Mainoo to be unhappy, but that doesn't mean his older brother should have rocked up to Old Trafford wearing a t-shirt to goad the manager. Ultimately, the stunt helps neither side.",
      "This is not the first time a player's family member has brought trouble to the Old Trafford door. Alejandro Garnacho's younger brother, Roberto, caused a stir with his social media activity and got the pair in hot water. Garnacho was axed at the end of last season. The youngster had been given too many chances and Amorim had finally seen enough.",
      "Roberto Garnacho said his brother was \"thrown under the bus\" after the Europa League final. There were several other outbursts, but he at least had the excuse of being a teenager.",
      "Mainoo-Hames is older, he is well-versed in the media world after a reality TV appearance and was aware that a photo of himself wearing the t-shirt would spread like wildfire online.",
      "And the timing of the stunt couldn't have been worse. Mainoo made a strong cameo from the bench and Casemiro is suspended for this weekend's game against Aston Villa after picking up another booking.",
      "Although Amorim started Manuel Ugarte against Brentford in September when Casemiro was unavailable, it felt likely that Mainoo would be given the nod ahead of Ugarte after his display against Bournemouth. It remains to be seen whether the 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' stunt will have changed that.",
      "Mainoo-Hames should have wrapped up warm in a coat and saved everyone the hassle.",

      "In a clip that shared by a fan on social media, Amorim was seen throwing his arms wide as he returned to his seat, before yelling in his native Portuguese: \"The ball has gone for half an hour, what is Leny doing?\" It is unclear at which point in the game this occurred.",
      "Earlier this month, Amorim remarked that Yoro 'thinks too much' after the 20‑year‑old appeared disconsolate on the bench, having been substituted in the 54th minute of United's 2‑1 win at Crystal Palace",
      "\"I also spoke with him because he thinks too much,\" he said. \"He makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he’s too young and he wants to do everything so well. He’s growing with games and with setbacks, it’s not easy for him as a young guy.",

      "United were unable to hold on to their lead at Old Trafford, despite going ahead three times. Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha scored in quick succession to make it 4-3 with 10 minutes remaining. Amad and Casemiro also found the net in what was a much-improved attacking display.",

      "Manchester United have been left an \"impossible\" task to replace Bryan Mbeumo and Amad and cope without them while the duo are at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "That is the verdict of ex-United defender Paul Parker, who believes United have been dealt a \"nightmare\" situation with both Mbeumo and Amad - their only two senior right wing options - heading to the tournament this week.",
      "Mbeumo, 26, has made an impressive start to life at Old Trafford following his £65million plus add-ons move from Brentford in July, scoring seven times in 17 appearances for the Reds. Meanwhile, Amad, who has dropped back to right-wing back this season to accommodate Mbeumo, has been a vital part of Ruben Amorim's set-up since he took charge and scored the opener in the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth on Monday.",
      "But United are now going to be without both Mbeumo and Amad for at least the next two-and-a-half weeks. AFCON gets underway this Sunday, with Mbeumo's Cameroon first in action on Wednesday, December 24 against Gabon, while Amad's Ivory Coast kickstart against Mozambique on the same day.",
      "With Cameroon and Ivory Coast in the same group, there is a small chance one of Mbeumo or Amad could be back in a United shirt sooner rather than later, though both nations will be expecting to progress. Should one - or even both - get knocked out of the group stage, it's expected that they would miss three Premier League matches against Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Wolves - and then be back to face Leeds United.",
      "But if Cameroon and/or Ivory Coast get through to the knockout phase, they wouldn't be able to feature for United against Leeds and could miss further matches, including the FA Cup third round tie against Brighton.",
      "The AFCON final takes place on Sunday, January 18, meaning Mbeumo and Amad would miss seven, maybe eight, United fixtures should their respective countries make it to the final two.",
      "Amorim is going to have to find a solution with Mbeumo and Amad out for the foreseeable future - but Parker believes it will be a very difficult task and that the Reds will \"struggle\" without them.",
      "Parker said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.\"",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Amad are not the only United players unavailable due to AFCON. Noussair Mazraoui is another, with the full-back heading to represent Morocco at the tournament.",

      "Manchester United drew 4-4 with Bournemouth in the Premier League on Monday. The game had plenty of twists and turns, but the points were shared after a late equaliser from Bournemouth forward Junior Kroupi.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha scored goals in quick succession to give United a 4-3 advantage with 10 minutes remaining, but the Reds gave Bournemouth another bite at the cherry as they secured a point.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Fernandes' efforts in vain",
      "Fernandes has been the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, and he made it 3-3 with a stunning free-kick at the Stretford End. United rushed back for the restart and Fernandes whipped up the crowd to increase the noise, knowing that United had time to score again to win the game.",
      "It took just two minutes for United to find that goal. Cunha finished to score his second goal for the club and the celebrations were wild. The Brazilian flung himself into the Stretford End, while Fernandes sprinted to where the substitutes were warming up to throw himself into their arms.",
      "United thought they had won the game, but Kroupi went up the other end of the pitch to bring the score to 4-4. United's biggest problem has been conceding goals - and it came back to haunt them.",
      "Fernandes was inconsolable at the full-time whistle, furiously venting on the pitch.",
      "The system change",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for stubbornly sticking by his 3-4-3 formation, but he tweaked his system against Bournemouth, playing with a back four when United were out of possession.",
      "When United attempted to build up play, Amad and Diogo Dalot were in the wing-back positions, but Amad pushed ahead of Leny Yoro when Bournemouth had the ball. The change caused some defensive teething issues, which prompted Amorim and his assistant, Carlos Fernandes, to give Yoro an earful.",
      "The change was a positive, though. Amorim has previously said the positions that players take up during a game are more important than the formation itself, and the shape was fluid throughout, which caused problems for Bournemouth, who were not prepared to play against the changed approach.",
      "Amorim said that not even the Pope could persuade him to change his formation, but he made a slight U-turn against Bournemouth. And United still found a way to drop points.",
      "Controversial decision",
      "United coach Adelio Candido man-marked referee Simon Hooper as the teams returned to the dressing room for half-time, seemingly complaining about the decision not to show Antoine Semenyo a red card.",
      "Dalot challenged Semenyo - it was a foul on the Bournemouth forward - but he reacted by placing his hands on the neck of the Portugal international. Casemiro was sent off for a similar incident involving Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes two years ago, but Hooper dished out yellows to the two players.",
      "Candido looked furious as he made his case to Hooper. The fans in the Stretford End recognised what the United coach was doing and taunted Hooper by singing: \"You Scouse b******.\"",
      "The lack of consistency in refereeing decisions in the Premier League has been a longstanding issue.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a small cheer from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand when Mainoo was called to prepare himself to come on just before the hour mark. An even bigger cheer from the entire crowd followed when Mainoo replaced Casemiro, with thousands of supporters standing to applaud.",
      "Amorim has produced some bruising quotes about Mainoo during press conferences over the last few weeks, so the reception for the midfielder was a clear message from fans within Old Trafford.",
      "It remains to be seen how the Mainoo situation unfolds in the January transfer window, but one thing is obvious: United fans want the academy graduate to stay at the club for years to come.",
      "Rollercoaster game",
      "Amad scored a gift-wrapped goal ahead of Christmas when Bournemouth goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic's hesitation created an opportunity that couldn't possibly be squandered.",
      "Dalot sent a brilliant cross into the box, Cunha won the flick on, and the ball kissed the crossbar before finding its way to Amad. The 23-year-old headed into an empty net to mark his last game before travelling to the Africa Cup of Nations with his second goal of the Premier League campaign.",
      "The majority of the credit for the goal should go to Dalot, who built upon his recent improvement down the left with another important contribution in the final third.",
      "Dalot's contribution didn't go unnoticed by the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, who enthusiastically applauded the defender as he returned to his position for the restart. However, the same fans were not applauding when the final whistle went, disappointed at the team's failure to see out a victory.",
      "Back-and-forth",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford is at its best for evening games and the Stretford End, in particular, was in fine voice. Anti-Glazer chants were aired and a \"full sale only\" banner was spotted before kick-off, demonstrating the continued unrest among fans about the club's ownership.",
      "\"Stand up if you hate Glazers,\" was heard, which was followed by a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer. United fans then aired the Amorim \"we'll back him from the Stretford End\" chant after Amad's goal.",
      "The Stretford End subsequently roared United back into the dressing room after Casemiro restored the advantage on the stroke of half-time, but it was Bournemouth fans who were gloating when play resumed for the second half, with the Cherries turning the game on its head in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"It's happened again, Man United, it's happened again,\" chanted the away end section, referencing the fact their side has scored three goals at Old Trafford for the third successive season. Amorim has overseen two of those games against Bournemouth, who should not be scoring so many when they visit Old Trafford.",

      "It has taken Ruben Amorim 13 months and 59 games as Manchester United head coach to bend to his principles and give in to pressure from pundits, supporters and even some players, but after a night of high drama and even higher stress, he might be reluctant to do so again.",
      "Amorim had hinted on Friday that the loss of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Africa Cup of Nations might force him into a tactical rethink, and this was the first sign of that plan. The one change from Wolves looked like-for-like, but when the game began, it was clear this was more back four than back three.",
      "There was plenty of versatility there. At times, it reverted to the familiar shape with Amad at wing-back, but more often than not he was further forward, with Leny Yoro at right-back and Diogo Dalot at left-back. Throughout the first half, it looked like Amorim had been missing a trick all along. By full-time, there were as many questions facing a back four as there were a back three.",
      "When will the real United under Amorim reveal themselves? They were electric in the opening exchanges in the first half and then out of battery at the start of the second. The contrast was baffling, as it was at both ends of the pitch. United were brilliant going forward but hopeless at the back and once again they saw the chance to go fifth get away from them.",
      "Bruno Fernandes couldn't hide his frustration at full-time. He was animated in arguing with Casemiro but looked to be venting his wider complaints at the Brazilian. He knows this chaos can't continue.",
      "It had looked like a different story on at least a couple of occasions. Three times United lead and after starting without intensity against Everton and West Ham, they tore into Bournemouth.",
      "Amad's goal in the 13th minute was United's eighth shot of the evening and the least they deserved for the enterprise they had shown in the opening exchanges. It was noticeable that Amorim's tactical shift was getting more players into the box. Bournemouth had been overworked in blocking shots from Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Amad, while Djordje Petrovic saved from Mason Mount.",
      "Petrovic could only stick an arm out when trying to smother Diogo Dalot's dangerous cross with Cunha lurking. The Brazilian didn't get a touch, but the ball bounced up for Amad to head into an empty net from a couple of yards out.",
      "The chances kept coming. Cunha stroked a shot just wide and Mbeumo forced Petrovic into another save. Cunha was pulling the strings as a false nine. Another excellent pass from his own half released Amad, whose shot was blocked by Adam Smith, and a perfect Cunha cross was met acrobatically by Mbeumo, but he could only volley over.",
      "United had racked up 12 shots to zero by the half hour but had a warning when Semme Lammens saved Marcus Tavernier's header from six yards, only they didn't heed it. Luke Shaw was bullied off the ball by Justin Kluivert and Ayden Heaven too slow to Antoine Semenyo, before his finish off the post.",
      "Casemiro restored the lead before half-time, with Petrovic making a mess of his header from Fernandes' corner, and it felt like that should have been that. But if United started the first half well, they were sleeping after the break.",
      "Within seconds of the restart, Tavernier's pass found Evanilson on the wrong side of Heaven, and he finished past a flat-footed Lammens. Soon after, Fernandes was caught on the ball in midfield and Casemiro forced into desperate action, conceding a free-kick 20 yards out. It proved pointless, Tavernier's low effort beating Lammens, who should have been protecting that side of the goal.",
      "United were beginning to look out of ideas as Amorim turned to Kobbie Mainoo to try and save his blushes. The roar that greeted Mainoo's emergence for Casemiro made it clear that Old Trafford regulars have no desire to see the academy graduate spend the second half of the season out on loan, but that noise was soon eclipsed.",
      "Fernandes made up for his mistake for Bournemouth's third by curling a magnificent free-kick into the top corner with 13 minutes to go, waving his arms to demand urgency on the pitch and in the stands. He got it immediately. Mbeumo forced his way through a tackle, Benjamin Sekso carried on the move and Cunha capitalised on a defensive error to fire in his second goal for the club.",
      "Fernandes made a beeline for the subs before running in front of the Stretford End to join his delirious teammates. Cunha kissed his shirt in front of the stand and Old Trafford came alive.",
      "But these supporters know by now never to take anything for granted. Junior Kroupi found space on the edge of the area and delivered a stunning finish and Bournemouth looked the more likely to win it. In eight added minutes, Lammens saved twice from David Brooks to ensure a disappointing night didn't become disastrous.",

      "Thanks to Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo's brother should get what he wants when Manchester United face Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Perhaps the Brazilian had got an early glimpse of his T-shirt and deliberately got himself booked to help out. Maybe he just wanted a couple of days off before Christmas. Or, and let's be honest, the most true reason, the seasoned former Real Madrid midfielder knew he needed to bring down Marcus Tavernier as he lined up a shot from the edge of the box. Unfortunately for Casemiro, he was booked, is banned for the trip to Villa Park, and Tavernier scored anyway.",
      "His ban should do what Mainoo's brother, a former Love Island contestant, is apparently desperate to see: Free Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "But if it doesn't and Ruben Amorim elects to call upon another - perhaps Manuel Ugarte - and the 20-year-old England midfielder is not given his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday, then he really has to push for a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Of course, the club's hierarchy are under no obligation at all to let Mainoo go - whether Amorim has him in his next starting line-up or not. And Mainoo's contract is relatively modest by United's standards, not a drain on finances and still has 18 months left to run.",
      "The player is keen to get more game time as he pushes for a World Cup spot. But, harsh as this may well be, that's irrelevant to Amorim and United.",
      "Make no mistake, the rest of the season is huge to the United boss. It could make or break his Old Trafford tenure. United don't have European commitments after last season's horror and frankly there are no excuses if United fail to secure a Champions League place for next season. None at all.",
      "Thus, if Amorim feels Mainoo - in any way, shape or form - can help him get United there, then he is perfectly entitled to keep him. Some of us now believe a parting of the ways would be best, as Amorim clearly wants something in his midfield that he doesn't believe the England international can do for him.",
      "But even it's that's true, then if Amorim wants to keep him at the club, Mainoo must simply get on with it.",
      "However, what he could really do without is his brother's T-shirt sideshow.",
      "It has nothing to do with the player himself, let’s get that straight. No-one could question Mainoo’s professionalism. Absolutely not. No-one could accuse Mainoo of feeling he is entitled to a regular starting place. Absolutely not.",
      "Some do, however. Mainoo's brother is not alone in that regard. But his actions don't help. Mainoo needs to prove himself to his manager, who is going nowhere.",
      "Last season, Amorim started Mainoo 12 times in the Premier League. United lost eight. They won only two. Of those two wins, United trailed Southampton 1-0 at half-time when Amorim hauled off Mainoo. United won 3-1.",
      "In his last six Premier League starts United have lost five and drawn one. His performance on Monday night was good enough, but he didn't stand out - and while United fought back to lead 4-3, it was Bournemouth who finished stronger and looked more likely winners before the final whistle blew.",
      "There are no obvious signs of Amorim keeping Mainoo on the fringes because he is not convinced about his character - no matter what Paul Scholes and other hypercritical pundits say. Quite simply, Amorim isn't convinced Mainoo is one of his best midfield options and thus doesn't play him.",
      "That might seem odd to those of use who watched his emergence, where his maturity and composure stood out. But right now, Amorim's is the view that matters.",
      "Hopefully, his brother's T-shirt stunt doesn't see Mainoo cop any flak. But he now needs to roll up his sleeves and prove his worth to his manager.",

      "United announced their latest financial figures on Thursday afternoon. Club sources have said the increased retail and merchandise revenue is due to the impact of a full three months’ trading under their new ecommerce model, compared to only one month in the prior year quarter.",
      "However, the increase will not be received warmly by anti-Glazer fans, who have protested against the American family and encouraged others to hurt their pockets by boycotting merchandise.",

      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",

United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",

      "Andrei Kanchelskis looked totally unrecognisable upon his return to Manchester United this week for a tour of the Carrington facilities.",
      "The Russian winger, who was instrumental in ending United's 26-year wait for a league title, is fondly remembered for his hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over local rivals Manchester City in 1994. The club shared heartwarming footage of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season during his tour, a campaign in which he played a pivotal role in securing the domestic double.",
      "Known for his blistering pace and nimble footwork, Kanchelskis' lean, tall physique often gave defenders a lot to deal with during his time in the Premier League. Almost two decades after hanging up his boots, he still sports a full head of hair, albeit styled more slickly than the curtain hairstyle he wore during his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The skillful winger had a successful footballing career, representing both the Soviet Union and Russia internationally. He also played for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division team Dynamo Bryansk. After retiring, he served as sporting director at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before transitioning into management with various teams across central Europe.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, the ex-winger was gifted a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season and enjoyed a trip down memory lane as he toured the training facilities.",
      "The United icon will be using his trip to England to gather fresh insights and inspiration before his side's domestic campaign begins in March. Kanchelskis had an exceptional 1994/95 season with the Red Devils, during which he claimed the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",

      "Diego Leon's future is up in the air ahead of the January transfer window. Leon has exclusively played in Manchester United academy fixtures this season and staff have been pleased with his progress.",
      "That does not necessarily mean Leon will receive an appropriate loan offer in the January window. The youngster has played for the Under-21s and interest may be thin on the ground.",
      "Leon's representative, Renato Bittar, spoke in Paraguay about January, saying: \"We still don't have it clear if he's going to go out on loan now, we have to keep watching. He's evolving and that's positive.\"",
      "Bittar added that it “would not be ideal” to interrupt his current season with a move away.",
      "For Leon to leave in the winter window, a club would have to submit a convincing development plan with the promise of regular game time, which could be unlikely to arrive in the middle of the campaign.",
      "It's understood that coaches believe Leon has plenty to work on. Academy fixtures have helped Leon improve, while staying in the building would allow him to continue joining first-team training sessions.",
      "United unveiled Leon as a first-team signing alongside Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in August. The defender was included in the United States pre-season tour squad in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named Leon in matchday squads against Grimsby Town, Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland this season, but he has not made his senior debut.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in January, but the deal outlined that he would move to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "United agreed a £3.3million fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, to sign the young defender.",
      "Before Leon travelled to Manchester, he spoke to local journalists at an airport in Paraguay, saying: “I’m going to kill it in the pre-season, and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them [first-team].\"",
      "The youngster's transfer made headlines in his homeland and Leon discussed the impact of his move.",
      "\"For Paraguay, to have a player playing here at United is huge,\" he told club media. \"I think for Paraguayans, they’re very proud to have someone from there playing in a club as big as Manchester United.",
      "\"It is an amazing, unique feeling to represent your country for all the people of Paraguay. I don’t know, it has no explanation - for my family it is an immense sense of pride to see me play with my national team.\"",

      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, which meant he broke the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months).",
      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is set to be hit particularly hard by the tournament's selection, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both big losses. They'll link up with Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, while Noussair Mazraoui will represent hosts Morocco.",
      "The tournament hosts have made it to at least the semi-final stage of the past two AFCON competitions. This is worth bearing in mind given Morocco tend to be a perennial contender and enters their own competition as favourites this year.",
      "It's also worth highlighting that in addition to being absent for fixtures, those venturing deeper in the tournament won't return to club duty straight away. And any players that get their hands on the title may be entitled to a few extra days to lap up their achievement before coming back to England.",
      "Morocco are the clear frontrunners with the bookmakers to win a first AFCON crown since 1976, while seven-time champions Egypt are second in the stakes. The Atlas Lions are heavily backed to top Group A ahead of Zambia, Mali and Comoros, while Egypt appear to have a slightly harder line-up against South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe in Group B.",
      "The competition doesn't get underway until December 21, although players will start to link up with their sides imminently. The tournament will conclude in Rabat on January 18, meaning some players could be away for a full month.",
      "During that span, there are six rounds of Premier League action due to be played. This includes a particularly demanding three-week period between December 20 and January 8, across which each top-flight club will play five times.",
      "Some of those Premier League outfits missing players over the next month face more testing periods than others. At least on paper given the current table and how teams are performing at present.",
      "For example, Aston Villa will face United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace (in that order) between December 21 and January 7. Brighton also has a testing run of fixtures over the next month or so, with Sunderland, Arsenal, City and Bournemouth each on the agenda while the AFCON is on.",

    "date": null,
    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "For a multi-millionaire, elite-level – no laughing in the back – footballer with a reputation for throwing tantrums about as often as he creates chances for hilariously inferior teammates, Bruno Fernandes is eminently relatable.",
      "He fundamentally just wants to be wanted.",
      "And such is the absurd nature of This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, not even 103 goals, 93 assists, 307 appearances and a handful of rejected offers to be happier, financially healthier and infinitely more rewarded elsewhere guarantees even that at the absolute worst of times.",
      "Fernandes has gone into more depth on how he is “hurting” and “sad” at feeling that Manchester United “wanted me to go” but ultimately lacked the “courage” to take the Saudi offer.",
      "But it is not particularly new information. In June he explained that he “spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave”. By October he cited specific conversations with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada, who he paraphrased as saying: “‘We won’t say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won’t say that it’s not the offer for us because obviously it’s massive money’.'”",
      "On both occasions he credited Ruben Amorim with persuading him to stay, as was again the case when Fernandes opened up once more after the Bournemouth draw.",
      "“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "“From the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",
      "The impotent fury he unleashed on the Old Trafford pitch at Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and anyone else who came within his enraged orbit, triggered by another successful episode of Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United, certainly added credence to the idea he simply cares more than anyone about their plight, at least outwardly.",
      "It is a connection and a “loyalty” Fernandes does not always feel has been reciprocated, a relationship Manchester United have exploited and taken for granted for more than half a decade.",
      "But of course the killers of free lunches, charity donations and jobs looked at a nine-figure offer for a 30-year-old and did not immediately dismiss it out of hand. It was simple business practice to reserve it as a live option, albeit with keeping Fernandes the clear preference.",
      "As the Portuguese himself said, “for them, money is more important than anything”.",
      "For a player who has very possibly sacrificed trophies and awards in the name of the worst modern iteration of this club, however, it inevitably “hurts”.",
      "“I was valued,” Fernandes said, “and what values ​​me most has to be my club, although lately I feel like I’m on thin ice. In England, when a player starts approaching 30, they start thinking they need a makeover. It’s like the furniture.”",
      "Fernandes, in an ideal world, should really be part of United for as long as he wants to be. But it also doesn’t work like that, especially when new landlords have taken over and are trying to run things properly.",
      "Had he left for £100m, Fernandes would have been the most expensive 30-year-old sale in football history.",
      "Manchester United executives had to consider it. Amorim had to overrule it. Fernandes has to be “hurt” by it. This is the sort of thing which fuels rather than foils him, as being behind only Erling Haaland for combined goals and assists in the Premier League so far this season suggests.",
      "There is no wrong party here, only miscommunications and different perspectives. Fernandes, for all his faults, is just the high-maintenance partner who does sometimes need and deserve a bit more back.",
      "Manchester United ‘insiders’ have responded to Bruno Fernandes after the captain claimed that they wanted to sell him in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "We understand all the reasons why Eddie Howe isn’t currently under pressure. But they really are quite sh*t.",
      "Watch closely and you will see why Kobbie Mainoo might infuriate his Manchester United manager.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "Manchester United must have felt they had weeded out most if not all the problem players. But if you are the company you keep, Kobbie Mainoo may be an issue.",
      "The BBC is now a ‘man-free zone’ apparently, apart from all the programmes presented by men, that is."

      "",
      "It is really interesting to be reminded in the mailbox and on other social media platforms how people view football through this aesthetics prism of reels and compilations that is fed to us.",
      "Obviously, they are generally the moments that we like to celebrate and last night’s match was indeed an incredible game with top quality attacking players showcasing some excellent moments. More of that, please.",
      "On the note of pleasing things, I was happy to see Kobbie Mainoo’s introduction onto the pitch and the subsequent increase in Manchester United’s tempo. He really knits the play together well at times.",
      "However, it was another example of how we have been trained to view football as an ‘on the ball’ game. Enjoy the exciting actions but overlook ‘invisible moments’ that often define matches. It is very easy to miss the subtle actions that allow attacking players to prosper. Cole Palmer failed to cut off the passing lane that supplied Fabian Ruiz in the build up to Spain’s knockout blow in the Euro 2024 final, yet I heard little mention of this in any pundit’s analysis.",
      "Mainoo’s below the radar defining actions last night were another perfect example. His moments on the ball were as sound as usual and his interplay with teammates advanced the ball well on a couple of occasions. But hands up who noticed Mainoo dive into a failed tackle on the left side of the pitch near the halfway line, resulting in Bournemouth’s fourth goal? His abandonment of position allowed the ball to reach Jimenez and for Kluviert to bomb forward, creating an overload. There was then space for the pass to Kroupi and he equalised. Rewatch it and see for yourselves.",
      "Further on in the game, an unnecessary Mainoo handball led to a clear chance for Brooks and a smart stop from Lammens. A few moments later, Dorgu and Mainoo both collided when going for a header, leading to another chance for Bournemouth at the death. I was deliberately watching Mainoo, to try to garner an understanding of why a player who featured for half of a dismal England Slovakia wash out and was subbed at 0-1 against each of Slovenia, Switzerland and Spain could be held in such high regard.",
      "Yes, he played a lot of successful short passes. Yes, he played relatively well against the Netherlands. Yes, he wasn’t Trent Alexander-Arnold or Connor Gallagher. But, overall, the ball wasn’t moved with speed to our forwards and resulted in a dearth of opportunities, as reflected in England’s attacking data. There were many others to blame here, of course.",
      "Compilations on Twitter/X can paint anyone in any light. That Liverpool game in the cup comes to mind. I certainly see the talent that Kobbie Mainoo has, but a more expansive passing range and a more diligent approach to defending are required to succeed in today’s game. His invisible moments were costly and almost fatal yesterday and I gained an understanding of why Amorim might view him as a liability who doubles up as a smooth operator.",
      "Ultimately, I wonder what position would be most suitable for him. An advanced 8 in a 4-3-3 set up? Perhaps alongside a hypothetical carbon copy of Rice and Zubimendi, we would see more of his full potential. Mainoo seems to be a model professional, so good luck to him.\nAC in Milan",

      "This silly old phrase of “if we had 11 ” then things would be great gets knocked around now and then.",
      "A BTL commented joked about having 11 Brunos. Obviously that would make for a catastrophic defence.",
      "But it raises the question of who the mailbox and BTL would pick if they had to play 11 duplicates as their team.",
      "For me, my first thought goes to Rooney. Happy to put a tackle in, probably decent in goal, and obviously good in attack and support.",
      "Second is a wild card: Dalot. Yes I know, but hear me out. He’s actually ok with shooting, he *can* tackle although often you do wonder about that, and he can run a lot which is always nice.",
      "Third, to keep it topical, I’ll say Mainoo. Since he used to be a forward anyway, that’s covered and defensively he would probably do fine although it would definitely need to be a fluid formation as we couldn’t have 9 players all hovering around the edge of the box.",

      "This team is lacking in many ways but we’ve clearly prioritised younger players to play this specific system so as long as there are steps forwards we can excuse drawing at home with the Cherries, considering they pantsed us 3-0 here last year it’s progress.",
      "Be interesting to see how we go without Amad and Mbuemo and who comes in while they’re gone, I’d love to see Mainoo get some minutes it’s a travesty the gaffer doesn’t rate him!

Already today I have read reports that we were playing a 3-4-3, a 4-4-2, a 4-3-3, a 3-4-2-1, a 4-2-4. This is why I said before that in my opinion the formation is a red herring and it is senseless being fixated on it.",
      "Watching the game, off the ball at times we had 4 at the back as Yoro shifted across right and Dalot dropped in, with Amad staying higher. But there were also times we had 5 at the back when Yoro stayed more compact and Amad dropped back. On the ball the shape was more familiar looking as we maintained 3 at the back and the wingbacks bombed forward. Even when Mainoo came on we kept the 2 in MF, and at one stage we did play 4-2-4 chasing the 4th goal.",
      "Point being that the shape is flexible, and has been all season. It all depends on the phase of play and opposition. Players will interchange, cover certain areas, track certain players and also sometimes there will be chaos and everyone gets swept up in it (like last night).",
      "The manager is still learning and hasn’t found the right balance yet (we are definitely too open at times) but he has shown he can be flexible, he has a few tricks up his sleeve and I have faith he will get it right.

      "Morgan Rogers’ goal being ranked 0.02xG isn’t saying Rodgers has a 2% chance of scoring, it’s an average of all professional players who have previously taken a shot from there. Yes not an exact science because how close were the defenders, who was in goal, was it windy etc, but a league 2 CB with a nosebleed shooting from there would be far lower xG just as the very best players (which given the wide sample Rogers would certainly class in) would be far higher.",
      "xG is not a prediction, it’s an average number of goals scored from very similar shots. When looking at a teams’ xG you can get a better idea of the game than just the score. Stats in football are always best used alongside watching the game, they can confirm or debunk your eye test.",
      "There is a phrase that you can’t outrun your xG. In the opening 5 or so games Liverpool had 5 wins but their xG for and against showed thy were fortunate – I understand you could also see that by watching all the games, but their xG showed they ‘should’ be more like 8th, and it caught up with them. For a short period Chelsea were the same then they dropped points in 3 straight games. Spurs earlier in the season were similar.",
      "Right now Villa are drastically out performing their xG. Perhaps we’ll see their results turn as it has for others….perhaps not after all it’s unlikely we finish with a table where every team finishes exactly where their xG says they should.",
      "Finally a quick one on Arsenal. No club is judged on their last result or performance more than Arsenal. As someone yesterday said, it’s like every result is treated as do or die. Now perhaps that is partly down to the Arsenal fans and our desperation for the title and knowing (to our cost) that one bad result, or one goal can be the difference between 1st and 2nd given the high standards at the top of the league. But I think there needs to be some reframing of expectations and rational analysis of results in context.",
      "I don’t think you can have only 1 team who is expected to win the league, and if they do then all other top teams are given a pass for not winning. This season all 3 of Arsenal, Liverpool and City should be expected to win the league, and 2nd is a failure.",
      "Given the amount of money they’ve spent I’d be tempted to include Chelsea there but most give them a pass because they haven’t challenged for a while forgetting what has been spent. But currently it seems like Arsenal are the only team expected to win the league, a reminder that whilst Arsenal have spent a lot of money assembling this very good squad, it’s no more money than most top teams and Spurs, Arsenal are not reigning champions, they haven’t won 6 of the last 8 titles, they weren’t favourites before the season started, they have no experience of winning, they don’t have a goal a game striker, they don’t have arguably the best manager ever in the game etc etc. it’s a strange dichotomy where all the things people use to bash Arsenal are the very reasons why it’s hard for Arsenal to win the league, but those same people will call it a huge failure if they don’t win it.",
      "This isn’t some way of trying to paint Arsenal as plucky underdogs, we’re 2 points clear and doing ok, and have built a depth of squad that should have every chance of winning it, and it will be a disappointment if we don’t, just as it should be for City and Liverpool.",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has reportedly made one January transfer request as Fabrizio Romano reveals the truth about their rumoured interest in Tyler Adams.",
      "Amorim is looking to finish in the European places this term after a disastrous first season in charge saw Man Utd finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe threw their weight behind Amorim in the summer transfer window with over £200m spent on five new plaeyrs.",
      "But now Amorim wants a new midfielder – one position Man Utd failed to strengthen over the summer – in the January market with a report in Spanish website Fichajes claiming that the Red Devils boss has made a ‘direct request’ to sign Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves.",
      "Neves has made clear his ‘desire is to return to a major European league’ with the Red Devils’ ‘priority would be to finalise the deal in January’ – but they may have to wait until the summer.",
      "READ: Manchester United might need transfer policy change as Garnacho problem threatens to strike again",
      "The report adds: ‘The main obstacle is Al-Hilal . The Saudi club is in no hurry to sell and is maintaining a firm stance regarding the winter transfer window. However, the player’s contract expires at the end of the season. This opens up a very attractive alternative for the English club.",
      "‘If no agreement is reached in January, Manchester United are confident they can sign him as a free agent in the summer. A move of enormous market value. Those in Saudi Arabia acknowledge that retaining the player will be difficult if he intends to return to Europe. The player’s desire carries weight.’",
      "Bournemouth midfielder Adams was recently named as a potential option for Man Utd to explore over the next couple of transfer windows and Romano insists the former Leeds player is on their “list”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “On Tyler Adams, from what I’m told, he is one of the names Man Utd are monitoring, but he is not the only one because there are several players on the list.",
      "“There are two separate lists. There are top, top targets like Carlos Baleba, Joao Neves and Adam Wharton – players considered top targets but very difficult, very unlikely for January, maybe more realistic for the summer. For January, it could be more about opportunities.",
      "“Bournemouth want to keep a player like Tyler Adams. They believe he’s a really important player for them, and it’s not going to be easy for Man Utd to find a solution in terms of pricing and timing. Bournemouth want to keep Tyler Adams also because of the Antoine Semenyo situation, which is also close to being evaluated in January.",
      "“At the moment, Bournemouth insist on keeping Tyler Adams at the club. Man Utd like the player, they see him as a potential option, but at the moment he’s not the only one and it’s not an easy one because Bournemouth insist on keeping the player in this January transfer window.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘to leave’ Manchester United and will ‘not’ be in charge next season, with INEOS ‘ready to make a dramatic decision’.",
      "Man Utd CEO Omar Berrada has identified his top target to replace Ruben Amorim if he fails to achieve his objectives this season, according to reports.",

      "Sources can confirm that the interest in Marc Guehi is as expected and amid strong claims that Manchester City have now made the player a ‘leading target’ in 2026, we can confirm the names of every major club in Europe who have made contact with his camp ahead of his exit on a free transfer away from Crystal Palace next summer.",
      "Guehi came close to joining Liverpool on the summer deadline day when a fee worth £35m was agreed by the Reds that would have also guaranteed Crystal Palace a further 10% cut of any future deal. But with the Eagles pulling the plug, where Guehi ends up next remains a wide-open question and with as many as THIRTEEN sides understood to have reached out to his camp ahead of a potential transfer.",
      "Per The Times, Guehi has now appeared on Manchester City‘s radar amid claims Pep Guardiola is planning a defensive overhaul at the Etihad in 2026.",
      "And while sources close to Guehi’s camp can confirm that interest is genuine, the Cityzens are far from the only side in the transfer mix for a player fast becoming the hottest commodity of the 2026 transfer windows.",
      "Whilst official offers and negotiations can’t begin until after January 1, interest has been lodged from more than a dozen clubs from across England and Europe.",
      "And we confirm that all but one of England’s big six are keen to sign Guehi. Liverpool, Chelsea, City, Manchester United and Tottenham have confirmed to the player’s camp that they are ready to offer him terms.",
      "Of the big six, Arsenal are the exception to that rule, with Mikel Arteta an admirer of the player but confident in his options, recently solidified by having tied down first-choice pairing Gabriel and William Saliba to long-term deals.",
      "However, sources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to TEAMtalk that Guehi is in no rush to commit to a new club and wants to assess his options.",
      "The source confirmed: “Marc is doing his thing, he is very happy with his form, and if you ask him, his main focus is on Palace and England ahead of the World Cup finals.",
      "“He is leaving his agents to assess his options, and they have told him he literally is going to have his pick of clubs. His people told him he is going to be one of the most wanted free agents of all time, if he leaves on a free, and that is exactly how things are panning out.”",
      "After the summer deal to Liverpool collapsed, Guehi’s camp confirmed to the Premier League champions, as well as all his other suitors, that the slate has been wiped clean and the race to land him was starting from that point.",
      "Since the breakdown of that move to Anfield, though, Guehi’s stock has risen further, fuelled by his impending free agency status but also by way of the fact that the 25-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant campaign to date.",
      "Now he heads into 2026 knowing he has his choice of Europe’s elite clubs.",
      "And as well as the interest from within the Premier League, we are told that there is a significant chance for Guehi to move abroad.",
      "We can confirm that Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG, Juventus, Inter Milan and Galatasaray have all registered their interest in opening official talks from January 1.",
      "Of those, it is Bayern Munich who have pushed the hardest, with their directors making clear the big push they are willing to make to win the race for his signature next year and with even Harry Kane trying to persuade his England teammate to join him in Bavaria.",
      "My colleague, Fraser Fletcher, also revealed recently that Barcelona have launched two formal approaches over the past fortnight.",
      "Palace could yet attempt to sell Guehi in January, but we can confirm that Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has once again confirmed to the club’s hierarchy that he is very much opposed to this.",
      "And Guehi himself is not in a hurry to leave Selhurst Park. Sources confirm he is open to finishing the season, with the hope of delivering yet more silverware to the club and having lifted the FA Cup and Community Shield with them last year.",
      "On the subject of Guehi, Palace are also understood to be doing their due diligence on a number of potential replacements.",
      "To that end, we revealed earlier this month that the Eagles are now chasing a title-winning centre-back who only just changed clubs for €20m earlier this season.",

      "The concept of Manchester United’s ‘no dickheads’ policy – myriad horses having bolted long before – was underlined by their first signing since the transfer edict.",
      "It is difficult to think of a more ‘no dickheads’ player than Mason Mount, with Jonny Evans arriving a fortnight later.",
      "That was the same summer in which Dean Henderson was their biggest sale. A phenomenal keeper and Crystal Palace stalwart he may have become, but one can absolutely see how he might have developed a certain difficult reputation at Old Trafford.",
      "Mason Greenwood, by the way, was offloaded the following year.",
      "Gilbert Enoka, the mental performance coach credited with transforming the All Blacks with what shouldn’t have been a particularly ground-breaking strategy of just not employing complete arses, once explained:",
      "“A dickhead makes everything about them. They are people who put themselves ahead of the team, people who think they’re entitled to things, expect the rules to be different for them, people operating deceitfully in the dark, or being unnecessarily loud about their work.”",
      "There is precisely no reason to believe Kobbie Mainoo falls into that category. He has received his 212 of a possible 1440 Premier League minutes this season with public grace and humility, keeping his counsel and only privately expressing a desire to leave on loan for more playing opportunities in a World Cup year.",
      "He has been a model professional and one of the better players even in a mere 29-minute cameo in the absurd draw against Bournemouth.",
      "But if you are the company you keep, Mainoo would do well to heed the warnings of his former academy equal. While Jordan Mainoo-Hames is not even vaguely on the same level as Roberto Garnacho in terms of brotherly bother, what transpired at Old Trafford feels like a slippery slope in that unhelpful direction.",
      "It did not feel like an act born of half-brotherly love or support. It seemed like little more than a publicity stunt from a former Love Island contestant turned influencer. And considering how Mainoo himself has handled the situation, it is tough to imagine him sanctioning, condoning or welcoming it.",
      "Over the weekend, Ruben Amorim had said he was “completely open” to discussing the player’s options, that he would “be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about” his future because “I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals”.",
      "The manager added that “frustration doesn’t help anybody”.",
      "Yet frustration is all that can really be felt when Amorim’s words were so quickly undercut by someone sitting front and centre in the Old Trafford stands before the game wearing a ‘FREE KOBBIE MAINOO’ t-shirt – which coincidentally is available for under £20 and is supposedly low on stock if the website now shilling it is to be believed.",
      "That made everything about Mainoo. That put him ahead of the team, made him seem entitled, that the rules for him were different. It was certainly unnecessarily loud in the tabloid ‘speaks volumes’ sense.",
      "It was a noise Manchester United, Amorim and indeed Mainoo could have done without; the game itself was raucous enough.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, entirely predictably, has liked one of the offending posts, presumably with a tingle of nostalgia. It remains to be seen whether his brother believes Mainoo to have been ‘thrown under the bus’. But even just a brief reminder of the sideshow they encouraged before jumping ship to Chelsea in the summer should discourage Camp Mainoo from venturing further down a path that leads only to more problems.",
      "After the issues with the Garnachos and to a far, far, far lesser but still relevant extent the Rashfords, it might be time for Manchester United to add a brother-based appendix to the ‘no dickheads’ policy, with Mainoo’s kin the first case in point.",

      "READ: Congratulations to Kobbie Mainoo’s brother for being the most embarrassing relative this Christmas",
      "Fernandes said via Maisfutebol: “The president of Al Hilal spoke to me. He called me directly. Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me. They wanted him to play in the Club World Cup with Al Hilal. It was a love that started back in the Jorge Jesus days, he had already called me in 2023.”",
      "The Man Utd captain insisted a move to Saudi Arabia had been tempting but insisted he didn’t push for a move despite feeling that the Man Utd hierarchy wanted to sell him.",

I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",

      "“It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",

      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames – who, as a former Love Island contestant is definitely famous in his own right and not just piggybacking off his younger brother’s success – was spotted at Old Trafford on Monday. I say spotted; Jordan did everything in his power to be seen.",
      "With a wristband that almost certainly means he has access to the posh seats on one hand and a presumably expensive gold watch on the other, Jordan took himself to the very front row of Old Trafford, turned around, leaned on the advertising hoarding and with a rather smug look on his face, looked back at the crowd to reveal a T-shirt reading ‘FREE KOBBIE MAINOO’, a slogan that is usually reserved for trapped peace leaders or generally someone who actually deserves such sympathy.",
      "The incarcerated man in question took up a familiar spot on the United bench for Monday’s barnburner against Bournemouth. He appeared just after the hour mark, replacing Casemiro, and went on to have 29 touches in the hockey-style game.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n* Amorim change brings glorious Man Utd chaos as Heaven nearly loses game Cunha failed to win\n* Amorim plays down Man Utd transfer question as ‘awful’ stat emerges after Bournemouth draw\n* ‘Got to be stronger’ – Neville slams Man Utd star in stunning Bournemouth draw",
      "The Bournemouth match was apparently the last straw for the Mainoo family. The player has started just one game this season, the club’s embarrassing FA Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby, and has been using every avenue possible to put pressure on the manager to play him or sell him. Media briefings suggest he wants a permanent exit but his status as an academy product with a high potential ability ceiling means United are unwilling to sanction anything more than a loan.",
      "We don’t know how much Mainoo himself had to do with his brother’s ‘protest’ or why Jordan felt now was the time to make a stand for the man on £20,000 a week, but it all seems rather unnecessary.",
      "His early breakthrough makes it easy to forget that he is only 20. For comparison, when Phil Foden was the same age, he made 28 league appearances. Mainoo looks likely to reach that same figure this year.",
      "Mainoo’s case is not helped by the fact that two of United’s best performers this year have been their central midfielders: Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. Fernandes, as club captain and still the team’s best creator even in a more reserved role, was never going to be dropped, while Casemiro’s form has picked up this year. Jordan’s heart must have sunk when both of them netted against Bournemouth. Or maybe it soared because this was his moment.",
      "Jordan’s PR stunt is particularly poorly timed as is it came at the final game before a number of United’s first-team regulars depart for AFCON. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui will all leave for the tournament and while not necessarily direct competition for Mainoo, it will likely mean an increase in playing time as Ruben Amorim is forced to use more of his squad.",
      "The final issue, and perhaps most important one, for Mainoo is that he has not been all that good when called upon. Sure, a few minutes here and there is hardly an ideal way to build into a rhythm, but if he was coming on and producing game-changing moments as Foden did, his place on the bench would be a lot harder for Amorim to maintain.

Did Jordan think that when he unveiled the shirt, the Old Trafford crowd would say ‘do you know what?

      "Remember when this season was boring and rubbish and the Premier League was finished because of long balls and long throws?",
      "Bollocks then and bollocks now. If anything, this has been a welcome return to a really good season. It might even be the best and most gloriously mental Premier League season of them all.",
      "Here are quite literally some – coincidentally reaching the contractually obligated 10 in total – reasons why that is the case.",
      "",
      "Our childishly petty favourite reason this season is good is the fact the answer to one of the key binary questions before a ball was kicked really does look like it might just be ‘Yes’.",
      "And that question is “Will Arsenal win the league or will Viktor Gyokeres be a big ol’ flop?” It didn’t really seem feasible that it could be both of those things, but we’ve now reached the point where it might even be probable.",
      "Arsenal are favourites to win the league still despite their own recent wobble, and Gyokeres is looking floppier by the day.",
      "It cannot be overstated just how at odds that situation is with the accepted wisdom during the long, far-off days of summer.",
      "Back then, there were two main schools of thought.",
      "Those who had Gyokeres as the final piece in the Arsenal puzzle; the longed for Proper Goalscorer whose 25-goal haul would get them over the line in those frustrating games that have dogged them in recent seasons where they’d play three games they ought to win but with no fox in the box carelessly find themselves drawing two and losing one, and suddenly having another mountain to climb as Man City or Liverpool skipped gaily away on the shoulders of their reliable goalscorers.",
      "Then there were the others, mainly from the Tactico camp, who didn’t much care at all for Gyokeres’ underlying numbers and expected him to struggle desperately to replicate his Portuguese form in the tougher Barclays school. Their numbers were swelled further by the always lively pessimist wing of the Arsenal fanbase who just assumed he’d do badly because Arsenal.",
      "The Tacticos are now gleefully claiming a decisive victory in the battle over the Eye-Test Gang while carefully ignoring the travails of their own preferred option for Arsenal at the time, which was Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Anyway. Gyokeres was, in short, set up to be either the final piece in the puzzle or sh*t. Nobody was suggesting he could be both. The sh*ttiest final puzzle piece in football history.",
      "The beauty of Gyokeres as a footballer was that there were multiple things that pointed to a straightforward either/or scenario. That either he would deliver Arsenal the title, or he would flop. Because he is quite a straightforward footballer. When he and the team around him works properly, he scores an awful lot of goals. We have seen this.",
      "But he is not, in any way, a Harry Kane sort of striker with an elite all-round game. He’s not even an Erling Haaland. If there aren’t goals, there really isn’t much else at all. And there have not been many goals, with just one since September in the Premier League.",
      "In all, three of his mere four Premier League goals have come against the promoted sides. And now he isn’t even contributing against teams at that level or lower, having barely touched the ball in a 2-1 win over Wolves that really might be the least impressive Arsenal win in the club’s entire league history.",
      "Yet where are Arsenal? Top of the pile. Only Manchester City, propelled by the Goalbot 3000 himself, have scored more.",
      "There’s an elemental lesson here about the temptation of narratives, if anyone cares to learn it (we certainly don’t), but the fact Arsenal’s long-term, quietly brilliant squad-building has been so successful that the complete flop of the megawatt ‘final piece’ it was universally acknowledged they desperately required has barely made a dent on their chances of success is already emerging as one of the season’s most delicious lines.",
      "",
      "You can’t really have a great season without a proper title race, can you? It’s the main reason we’re all here and we’re overdue. Last season was over very early, and for all Arsenal’s efforts in the two previous seasons it still felt clear which way the story was ending some time before it actually ended.",
      "One of our concerns for this season even a couple of weeks ago was that Arsenal might just absolutely p*ss it. They appeared to have the best team, the best squad and just quite simply the fewest reasons you could think it might go wrong.",
      "But the one reason they did have, is the one both easiest and hardest to define: they are Arsenal.",
      "And somehow, that seems to be panning out. Without really doing an awful lot wrong, an Arsenal team that could very, very easily be eight points clear and disappearing over the horizon is instead looking nervously over its shoulder at the worst possible team to find lurking just two points back.",
      "They’ve both been here before, and it didn’t end well for Arsenal then. This does feel like a different and older and wiser Arsenal, but then they all had little toddler tantrums after Villa scored and then played so badly in beating Wolves – about whom more later – that we couldn’t detect even homeopathic levels of the Hallmark of Champions usually present in such occasions.",
      "READ: Five tables show why Arsenal should fear Man City resurgence",
      "",
      "Thanks to the outstanding efforts of Sunderland, the competent efforts of Leeds and Burnley trying their very best, bless them, we appear to have a proper relegation battle. We don’t want to jinx it because it’s been absolutely bloody ages since one of those, but it does appear that at least one and an outside chance of two relegation places are actually legitimately in play this season.",
      "Now caution is necessary here because some other promoted-then-relegated teams have looked like they might make a fight of it and then not in the end made a fight of it. But this does feel very different.",
      "In Sunderland’s case because the thing they’re making a fight of is the top six, and in Leeds’ because they appear to be improving for every run rather than starting promisingly and then wilting, which is the more standard direction of travel for these things.",
      "",
      "Enormously greedy, this, because West Ham should be enough. They’ve been a Premier League team for all but four of its 33 seasons. That’s more than Manchester City and only one fewer than Aston Villa or Newcastle. Only the Never Relegated Six plus Man City are on longer current streaks of pure Barclays than the Hammers.",
      "They are absolutely a big Premier League club to be in such serious relegation peril, but could we yet reel an even bigger fish into those murky waters?",
      "The recent significant improvements at Leeds, Forest and yes even a little bit at West Ham are tantalising here.",
      "The key question becomes ‘Do West Ham look capable of 40 points?’ And the answer is yes. They might not get them, but they absolutely could. And your Forests and Leedses are absolutely doing enough right now to suggest they can.",
      "That leaves the bumblef*ck big clubs in real danger of sleepwalking into actual trouble. There are two of them currently dozing in 11th and 12th playing largely sh*t football and with 22 points to their names.",
      "They should be fine. Of course they should be fine. But either of them absolutely might not be. Both Spurs and Newcastle currently appear blissfully unaware of the potential horrors that could await in the second half of the season if they carry on as they absent-mindedly are.",
      "Particularly arrogant of Spurs, who managed only 38 points last season and are playing worse now than they were at this stage last season under a manager with absolutely no apparent real plan. Say what you like about the tenets of Angeball, at least it’s an ethos.",
      "But even if we don’t in fact get one of those two involved, the fact the most likely alternative right now appears to be a proper scrap between West Ham, Leeds and Forest should really be enough for anyone.",

      "And to continue our relegation-based gluttony, how good to simultaneously boast a Proper Relegation Battle (or at the very, very least an undignified squabble over 18th) while a bit lower down also having the excitement of a genuine threat to Derby’s grip on the most infamous – and among the most difficult to beat even if you were actively trying – records in Premier League history?",
      "Both their historic low points tally of 11 and somehow at almost half-season distance also their record of one solitary win that season are in play thanks to Wolves’ long-term strategy of continuously hollowing out their squad depth finally and catastrophically catching up with them.",
      "",
      "And even if/when Wolves do win a game, that’s also fine because it will (probably) confirm that the Premier League really is a league Where Anyone Can Beat Anyone.",
      "We don’t mean that in a woolly, general vibe sense either. It will be actually true. Two things this weekend sent us down this rabbit-hole; watching rock-bottom Wolves give leaders and title favourites Arsenal a tremendous game at the Emirates, and then Forest giving Spurs a 3-0 paddling at the City Ground the next day.",
      "That last result completed a wonderfully neat little Circle of Parity involving that pair and Everton that runs thus: Spurs beat Everton 3-0, Everton beat Forest 3-0, Forest beat Spurs 3-0.",
      "Obviously our stupid brain then wondered just how close the 19 teams who have managed to beat anybody this season were to a 19-team Circle of Parity. Albeit without the added fun of correct scorelines.",
      "To our absolute but exhausted delight we discovered that already, before half-distance, there is a 19-team Circle of Parity in this season’s Premier League.",

      "",
      "A team that probably shouldn’t even have got promoted – they finished 24 points behind Leeds and Burnley and even 14 behind Sheffield United having ended the regular season in horror form – now absolutely ripping it up in the Premier League? Wonderful.",
      "First things first, they (although we must acknowledge Wolves’ selfless assist here) have already pretty much guaranteed we won’t be seeing the three promoted teams go straight back down which is a hugely welcome development. And if the three promoted teams do now all go down, then, well, we’re in for a truly astonishing second half of the season anyway so that’s also fine.",
      "More likely, though, is that Sunderland continuing knocking about in the rarefied top-half air they currently breathe. Even if they don’t in fact end up level on points with Liverpool and separated only on goals scored when the music finally stops in May.",
      "There are all sorts of ambitions you could reasonably have for the remainder of Sunderland’s season. They could definitely qualify for Europe, for instance, which would be a spectacular bit of work.",
      "Our goal for them is, inevitably, more mischief-based. We want them to reach 59 points. Why 59? Because it’s the sum total the three promoted teams Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton managed last season.",

      "That slow start to the season came on the back of a difficult summer, where Villa were unable to do the business they wanted to do and were hamstrung to a large extent by their continued flirtation with the very edges of the PSR regulations. Even now, it still feels like something quite bad is being stored up for the future there.",
      "But never mind all that now. Because since those five games in which Villa managed three points and one measly goal, they’ve scored 24 in a further 11. And rather ludicrously won 10 of them.",
      "Their late winner against Arsenal prompted absolute cinema in the reactions of the Gunners, but it was also one of the most significant three-point swings of the season, one swing of Emi Buendia’s right foot turning a six-point gap to Arsenal to a three-point gap.",
      "Villa have even since then passed up the traditional opportunity for such over-achieving clubs to chucklef*ck their way back out of a title race the moment they unexpectedly find themselves in it.",
      "A trip to West Ham in which they found themselves behind in the first minute and trailing again by half-time looked to be going entirely to that script, but no. The run continues.

That’s, on average, three doses of injury-time drama (albeit actual drama of injury-time goals may vary) per 10-game matchday.",

      "Adding that “I love the fans and I am very happy with the fans” did in fairness remove quite a lot of the ambiguity, and has left us amateur detectives to pin the crime on one, some or all of the Blues higher-ups, of which there are currently dozens.",
      "It’s the bolshy criticism of a manager with far more credit in the bank than Maresca. He’s Antonio Conte but with the Conference League and Club World Cup rather than six league titles. Most report cards from Chelsea fans for Maresca would read ‘good, could do better’, and while many may be frustrated after the progress he’s made should he be sacked, there wouldn’t be the outpouring of grief or anger from the supporters that the Italian must expect to make such a statement.",
      "He’s not untouchable, and apparently also very quick to forget that the Chelsea board have stuck with him at point when the fans would happily have seen the back of him.",
      "Chelsea have Newcastle (A), Aston Villa (H) and Bournemouth (H) left to come in 2025 and a couple of bad results will see the fans turn again, and this time, after breaking ranks and attacking the Chelsea chiefs, they will happily send him packing.",

      "West Ham haven’t beaten Manchester City in the Premier League since September 2015 when Diafra Sakho scored past Joe Hart, before Pep Guardiola took charge. The Hammers have taken points off City just three times in the 19 games since and never at the Etihad, where they meet next weekend.",

      "After 10 wins in 11 games has left Aston Villa just three points behind league-leaders Arsenal, it’s becoming more difficult for Unai Emery to insist his side are not in the title race.",
      "“We don’t feel under pressure,” was the latest claim of a manager understandably keen to avoid title-challenger labels lest it affect the quite ludicrous momentum and confidence they’ve built up, which has seen them score a stoppage-time winner to beat Arsenal and come from behind twice to beat West Ham in their last two games.",

      "A combination of Guglielmo Vicario, Archie Gray and Djed Spence drew focus away from Frank’s damning substitutions against Nottingham Forest, in yet another game where the lack of attacking fluidity or any repeatable pattern in the final third suggests the direction in training or from the sidelines just isn’t getting through to a group of absurdly disconnected footballers.",
      "There’s now ‘total panic’ at Spurs as Frank’s ‘toxic playing style cripples the brand’ and Liverpool (A) and Crystal Palace (H) are arguably the perfect sack bait as teams not good enough for defeats to be brushed off, ahead of a return to his Gtech stomping ground as a fitting place of rest.",

      "They look set to be hit harder than any other Premier League side, and while this season has already taught us to not doubt Sunderland on multiple occasions, there’s surely no world in which they fly through their first season back in the top flight without a bump in the road and this feels as likely a time as any.",

      "Two wins from three games against Crystal Palace (H), Sunderland (A) and Liverpool (A) for Leeds and three consecutive defeats for Burnley in games against Bournemouth (A), Everton (H) and Newcastle (H) would see Parker take the mantle from Farke as the Premier League manager with the worst points per game ratio.",

      "Attack, attack, attack… no, not that much… oh sh*t.",
      "A wonderful, brilliantly bonkers game of football featured eight goals, outstanding attacking football, some poor finishing, more very good finishing, horrible defending, goalkeeping blunders, two excellent free-kicks and a very welcome and long overdue formation change from Ruben Amorim to give rise to the beautiful chaos at Old Trafford.",
      "“The front four have been excellent for United, they really have,” Gary Neville said towards the end of the first half in a game in which the Old Trafford fans were treated to the most dynamic and fluent attacking display of the Ruben Amorim era while also enduring one of the weakest defensive performances, as four at the back brought out the best and worst of them.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Amad Diallo were indeed brilliant, zipping passes into each other and creating chances seemingly at will with the ball on a string between them against a horribly shaky Bournemouth defence that had conceded 13 goals in five games before stopping the rot with a clean sheet against Chelsea.",
      "MAILBOX: Mainoo ‘almost Maguire levels of slow’ as loan now best option for Man Utd",
      "And yet, had it not been for a pretty horrific goalkeeping blunder from Djordje Petrovic, who would have saved Casemiro’s tame back-post header on the stroke of half-time had he merely stood still rather than collapsing into his own net and allowing the ball to bounce over his gloves, Manchester United would have gone into the break level with a side they had almost entirely dominated after those forwards didn’t quite deliver “everything you want”, as Neville claimed was the case on commentary.",
      "Amad Diallo’s header from roughly half a yard into an open goal contributed 0.99 to a first-half xG of 2.62 compared to Bournemouth’s 0.99. The hosts’ 17 shots was more than any other Premier League side in a half of football this season.",
      "Those ‘underlying numbers’ are typically used to offer hope of a better future. “If they could only finish their chances” – that sort of thing. But we would contend with the suggestion that United being 18th in the Premier League for goals minus expected goals (G-xG) with a score of -2.8 – above only Wolves (-5.6) and Crystal Palace (-7.2) – is a good thing, particularly when joined on negative scores by Brentford, Liverpool, Leeds, Brighton, Everton and Nottingham Forest. That doesn’t feel like a gang you want to be a part of.",
      "Bruno Fernandes’ sublime free-kick, which kissed off the bar to draw United level at 3-3, and Cunha’s relatively simple finish to make it 4-3 means they actually finished the game with a positive score having accrued an xG of 3.27, but that pair were 459th and 465th respectively among 468 players for G-xG before this game and played their part in failing to get this game won in the first half before their defensive teammates ensured they didn’t claim all three points in the second. Cunha had eight shots and just two on target.",
      "Luke Shaw was horribly weak before the break in being brushed off the ball before Antoine Semenyo bore down on goal as Ayden Heaven watched on. We know he’s young, but you need only know that the currency of football is scoring goals to come across and close Semenyo down in that situation. It was bizarre.",
      "The cobbled-together defence were ripped open within 40 seconds of the second half as Evanilson gulped down the medicine prescribed by Dr Manchester United to score his first goal since August after Semenyo netted for the first time since early October.",
      "Familiar problems in playing Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes at the base of midfield were exposed by Marcus Tavernier five minutes later as he tore through the centre of the pitch before being brought down by Casemiro and firing in the resulting free-kick past Senne Lammens as the United goalkeeper mistimed his jump to give himself little chance of making the save.",
      "And after Fernandes and Cunha got Manchester United back in front, Junior Kroupi came off the bench to again take advantage of the Red Devils’ soft centre with a brilliant touch and finish past Lammens to make it 4-4 after Bournemouth swarmed United from a throw-in. David Brooks could so easily have made it 5-4 but was denied twice by Lammens.",
      "All United fans should, and we suspect the vast majority will, vote for Amorim to persevere with four at the back. It made for a performance of stunning attacking verve and while Bournemouth’s typically intense style of play poked at gaps in the rearguard, Heaven and Shaw won’t ever be paired at centre-back together again and teething problems are to be expected.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has warned Ruben Amorim that he will always be a few defeats away from the sack after a challenging first year at the club left a scar that will take time heal.",
      "United boss Amorim oversaw a disastrous 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, with defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham last May another low point for the Portuguese tactician.",
      "United’s inconsistencies this season have left Amorim teetering on the brink of an Old Trafford exit on a few occasions, with co-owner Jim Ratcliffe stepping in to insist the club would back their manager at one of his lowest moments.",
      "Now Parker has claimed Amorim will face persistent pressure every time his team have a dip in results, as he suggested the expectations around a United manager will not change despite the club’s slide in fortunes over recent years.",
      "The former defender, who won two Premier League titles under Sir Alex Ferguson’s management during his time at United, also claimed the unpredictable nature of this season’s Premier League has ramped up the pressure on Amorim to deliver Champions League football next season.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim stands accused of ‘rampage’ as THREE kids ‘brutally’ attacked",
      "“Given the nature of the Premier League this season and how every team is dropping points, United have to finish in the top four,” Parker told Football365 with British Gambler.",
      "“At the start of the season, I said United should be aiming for top eight and a return to European football, but that has changed given everything we have seen this season.",
      "“Liverpool have been struggling, Tottenham are not performing well, Chelsea are inconsistent and teams like Crystal Palace and Sunderland are in the top four mix. Well, Manchester United have to be there as well.",
      "“A lot of the teams are poor this season. At the moment, we might be seeing 2016 again, when Leicester won the title, so that puts pressure on United.",
      "“Every manager who has been at Manchester United since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013 has faced the same pressure and that won’t change.",
      "“Sir Alex always said that if you lose more than five league games, you won’t win the league. That was considered to be a bad season.",
      "“Now, we are seeing United losing four and five games quickly and last season they lost 18 matches, which is an incredible number for a club of that size. A lot of that number is on Amorim.",
      "“He is willing to take on that burden and expectation. He must have known that when he took on the job, his whole life would be 90 minutes of football and endless interviews. And when you lose as Manchester United manager, you know what is coming at you.”",
      "Parker also gave his verdict on the ongoing omission of Kobbie Mainoo from the United line-up, as he challenged Amorim to explain why he has decided to leave the youngster out of his team despite the need for midfield reinforcements.",
      "“The manager needs to give a reason why Mainoo is not part of his plans,” added Parker. “Kobbie needs to play. He deserves to have a chance to play a run of games and show what he can do.",
      "“It’s not up to me to tell Amorim who to pick, but we saw Mainoo had the talent when he came into the team and he hasn’t been given the chance to build on that.",
      "“When he comes on now, he has played a bit-part role and he is trying not to make a mistake, so the manager needs to make him feel wanted. Amorim needs to tell him he is playing the next game and he needs to make him feel he is part of it.",
      "“If that doesn’t happen, he probably needs to go on loan, prove what he can do and then return to United to give the manager a chance to say he made a mistake and bring him back into his team.",
      "“At the moment, a lot of the fans are standing with the manager because they know getting rid of another manager is bringing the club down again and creating more chaos. They don’t want that.",
      "“What everyone wants is to get a manager in place who is there for the long term and brings the club back, but there are questions over whether that man is Amorim and the fans want to see Mainoo in that team.”",

      "",
      "I wrote in nearly a year ago now talking about the futures of United’s young players after stories were leaked of how INEOS would consider selling these talents to fund a rebuild. Regarding Kobbie Mainoo my opinion was;",
      "‘Our Stockport Seedorf may never live up to his potential or our expectation but he is the shining light in this team. In the future, like Rashford, we may be discussing a transfer away that is best for all parties but that isn’t where we are now, no fee could be justified to the fans.’",
      "Unfortunately I think we’ve reached that point where Mainoo leaving, albeit on loan, is best for all parties.",
      "I understand why Amorim is reluctant to play Kobbie in the midfield pivot. He is almost Maguire levels of slow and too often have opposition players simply glided past him through the middle. The work demanded of the two midfielders is beyond what Mainoo can offer, fair enough.",
      "What I fail to understand is why he’s not at least getting some minutes as one of the 10s. Mainoo excels in the small spaces, his control and dribbling are fantastic, he can beat a few men then shoot, or pass well enough to create a shooting chance for a team mate, or simply rotate his position to drag away a defender. This is the essence of what Cunha is tasked with in Amorim’s system.",
      "Cunha has only played 63% of the available league minutes so far and decent chunks of that in the striker role. So really that left 10 position has been available for about half the games so far and Mainoo hasn’t been played there once. It’s kind of baffling really. Mount has had a few good games and I’m pleased about that but even Zirkzee is getting more minutes at the moment and he’s been consistently bad.",
      "If there was some personal thing, or disciplinary issue then we’d know about it. Amorim has not been hesitant in publicly revealing such things previously. He seemingly just does not rate him. Whatever Amorim looks for in his players, that one indescribable quality which makes us like people, he doesn’t see in Mainoo.",
      "A loan away to Napoli seems like a great option at the moment. Let him go and play, rekindle his development in a league where his qualities should shine. Then in the summer we’ll see, perhaps the manager changes his mind. That feels unlikely though and so if Amorim continues in the job then a sale would be the only realistic option.",
      "Some fans will never forgive the manager if that is the case and they shouldn’t. There is very little which emotionally connects us with our football clubs anymore. A prodigiously talented local lad coming through the club’s academy to score the deciding goal in an FA Cup final is just about as good as it can get. Keeping that player from the fans is bad enough, selling him would be tragic.\nDave, Manchester (writing before the Bournemouth game so perhaps I’ve poked fate sufficiently and Kobbie comes on to score the winner)",

I have supported every United manager since Fergie till the day they were sacked, no questions asked, even LVG & ETH. But never has one manager been so hellbent on randomly just putting down his own players for no actual reason. When others did it at least there was an agenda to either motivate them or throw them out of the team.",

Davies was actually a good shout. But that’s a change to be made at half time along with some tweaks to a moribund attack. You’re probably going to get a lot of letters about this, but Davies and Paulhina coming on at 2 – 0 down is madness. A lot of fans want this to work out – they don’t want another manager, but those substitutions are impossible to understand.",
      "Luckily, Spence mugged him off again. Which means he’s going to have to bare his teeth. Frank has hit rock bottom, but he’s not dead and buried. Spence can’t play on Saturday if Frank wants to be taken seriously. He talks about burning inside, but I don’t see any fire in his belly. He has a pragmatic style of football and a pragmatic personality. Romero seems to like him. Others think he’s a doughnut. Those that think he’s a doughnut need to be dealt with. There’s also the small matter of the football getting better and him settling on a system that works against an improving LFC but learning that he can’t be everyone’s mate is his biggest challenge.",
      "Two choices – either he throws Spence under the bus – no one’s going to use it on LinkedIn as a way to motivate teams, but it might buy him some respect and time. Or he goes full Pacino in ‘Any Given Sunday’, pours his heart out and tells them he doesn’t like the face he sees in the mirror anymore. Either is fine.

      "Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is looking for a way out in the January transfer window with some Red Devils figures ‘very uneasy’ by Ruben Amorim’s handling of the academy graduate.",
      "The England international has not started in the Premier League for Man Utd this term with Ruben Amorim preferring other players in midfield.",
      "Mainoo, who has been linked with a loan move to Napoli, has made ten appearances off the substitutes’ bench in the Premier League – but his only start in all competitions came as Man Utd were knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by Grimsby Town earlier this year.",
      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",
      "However, Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox managed to persuade Mainoo to fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "Amorim has not provided him enough minutes in the first team and now the Daily Telegraph insists that Mainoo ‘feels frozen out’ by the Portuguese coach.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim stands accused of ‘rampage’ as THREE kids ‘brutally’ attacked",
      "The report adds: ‘Mainoo’s exasperation over his current situation at Old Trafford barely needs stating. He feels frozen out by a manager who has yet to start him in a Premier League game this season and wants to leave on loan next month in pursuit of regular playing time. Napoli are heading a disorderly queue of more than a dozen clubs eager to take the 20-year-old.’",
      "It is also understood that ‘there are figures within the club who are very uneasy about the player’s predicament and what a potential exit could signify’.",
      "Former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown insists that Mainoo now wants to “jump ship” in the winter after his “crazy” treatment from Amorim.",
      "Brown told Football Insider: “Mainoo will push to leave in January, I have no doubt.",
      "“It’s crazy the way he’s been treated, but Amorim isn’t the only one to blame, Man United were testing the waters about interest in him during the summer.",
      "“All of the noise coming out of the club was that they would be prepared to let him go for the right price because of their financial situation.",
      "“Nothing ended up happening, but it’s something they looked into, and the player was made aware of that which left him a bit unsettled.",
      "“If you keep telling a player he’s not wanted by the club and the manager, even if you later change your minds, he’s not going to want to stick around.",
      "“Mainoo works hard, he’s a creative player, an excellent passer of the ball. He’s not a powerhouse or a flying machine, but he’s a very, very good footballer.",
      "“The fact he continues to be left out of the side and isn’t even coming off the bench, he could go and start every week for a lot of top clubs in Europe.",
      "“He knows that, and he knows there’s interest, it won’t come as a surprise to anybody but if the chance comes up he will want to jump ship.",

That is really hard to get.",
      "“They have more or less the same characteristics, the both of them, and we are losing them for a few games. But it’s a good opportunity for us to try to play in a different way.”",

      "Tuesday 16 December 2025 18:17, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy Ruben Amorim.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "Fernandes said in October that United's hierarchy told him they would not stand in his way if he wished to leave but that they wanted to keep him.",
      "However, the 31-year-old, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year, struck a very different tone in this interview which was recorded in November.",
      "\"I decided not to go [to Saudi Arabia], not only for family reasons, but because I genuinely liked the club,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"From the club I felt, 'if you go it's not that bad for us'. It hurts me a bit. More than hurting, makes me sad, I'm a player who has nothing to point to, I'm always available, I always give the best of me.\"",
      "\"Jason [Wilcox], like Omar [Berrada], said 'we won't say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us because obviously it's massive money'.\"",

      "Fernandes believes there was an unwillingness from those above Amorim to challenge the head coach.",

      "Fernandes has been United's best player in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but the offer of £100m for a player turning 31 was viewed by many as too good to turn down.",
      "The Portugal international was frustrated that he perceived this to be the view from within the club after he had stuck with United through so many lows despite having the chance to win silverware elsewhere.",
      "Fernandes also revealed he could have left to join another club the season before Saudi came in for him.",
      "\"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. Because in England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",

      "City are keeping close tabs on developments with the 25-year-old, with Tottenham also keen - and some insiders believe Pep Guardiola's side are now the strongest contenders for his signature.",
      "United are considered serious rivals for both City and Spurs, however, with Liverpool believed to still be in the background. Ruben Amorim described Semenyo as a \"special player\" ahead of the game against Bournemouth.",
      "United have not been actively looking to sign another forward in January but believe the opportunity to sign Semenyo - which will come next month and for a set price - is something they must genuinely consider.",
      "The biggest obstacle for United is financial, though. While they are not currently at risk of breaching the PSR regulations, a £65m fee could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, where a defensive-midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "They are reluctant to get involved in a bidding war for Semenyo with some of the biggest clubs in the Premier League and will not jeopardise their ability to strengthen the midfield next summer in favour of another attacker.",
      "Arsenal have kept an eye on Semenyo's development but - as it stands - they are well stocked in the forward areas and have five players who can play wide-left.",
      "Despite the speculation over his future, Semenyo's inner circle insist he remains exclusively focused on training, fitness and match performance for Bournemouth.",
      "The south-coast club hope to keep the Ghana international, whose country will not be at the upcoming AFCON but will face England at next year's World Cup.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim described Semenyo as a \"special player\" unprompted in his press conference ahead of Monday's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It is a top team, top manager with a special player,\" Amorim said of Bournemouth, without clarifying which player he was referring to.",
      "Asked if his comment was about Semenyo, he added: \"Yes.\"",
      "Pressed on if he would like to sign the winger, Amorim said: \"It is not that case. There are a lot of special players in the league.",
      "\"What I feel is that [Bournemouth have] a top manager, top team - I really like the team - and a top play, I think he is a special player.\"",
      "United held strong interest in Semenyo over the summer but ended up signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for the forward positions.",
      "Semenyo scored at Old Trafford on Monday night after United's opener to equalise for Bournemouth. It was not the first time he has been among the goal against Amorim's side.",

      "Manchester United and Bournemouth traded blows in a thrilling 4-4 draw that saw Ruben Amorim make the first changes to his formation since taking over at Old Trafford.",
      "In a riveting, rollercoaster contest, that Jamie Carragher subsequently hailed as \"the best game of the Premier League season so far\":",
      "Amorim has staunchly defended his 3-4-3 system, but looked to be playing a tweaked or even entirely altered formation from kick-off. And the middle of the second half, he had thrown caution to the wind and gone for a 4-2-4.",
      "The changes certainly worked with Manchester United dominant in the first half and making a deserved breakthrough in the 13th minute when Amad Diallo nodded home on his final appearance before the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "But their good play going forward was undone when Luke Shaw was too easily barged out of the way, allowing Antoine Semenyo to power forward. He then swept home, with the goal coming against the run of play.",
      "Deservedly though, Casemiro nodded Manchester United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner - the hosts' seventh from the set piece this season, with only Arsenal (9) scoring more.",
      "But just seven minutes after the break, the Red Devils somehow found themselves 3-2 behind. Bournemouth equalised with a brilliant finish from Evanilson 38 seconds into the second half, before Marcus Tavernier curled a wonderful free-kick into the bottom left corner.",
      "Then it was Manchester United's turn to score two quick goals to restore their lead as the pendulum swung back the other way. Bruno Fernandes scored a wonderful free-kick to level, before Cunha turned home inside a packed box as the ball fell kindly his way.",
      "But the drama wasn't over yet.",
      "Bournemouth hit back again to round off an incredible eight-goal thriller. Eli Junior Kroupi - just on as a substitute - added to the raft of high-quality goals as he squeezed through the central defenders before arrowing home his effort.",
      "The result moves Manchester United into sixth place on 26 points - level with Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Sunderland. Bournemouth are nudged up into 13th spot.",
      "\"We have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far. That's what makes the Premier League the greatest league, the greatest product or whatever you want to call it, in the world.\"",
      "\"I think it's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There was lots of that.",
      "\"Bournemouth were not at the races in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half.\"",
      "\"A fun game. We started really well, did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"We lost the concentration and they scored two goals. But we managed to get back to the game, we scored two goals again and then we have to finish the game.",
      "\"We need to think about not to go again, but to take calm and to close the game. A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.",
      "\"We need to focus on the performance today, different from the last two at home. That is also a point that we pay attention to. The result is the same and at one point, it's frustrating, but the performance is different.\"",

      "\"We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended. The second goal is a cheap goal, a cheap one for us to concede. The corner is not even a great header.",
      "\"We finished really well the first half. When we scored the 1-1 we were feeling comfortable and were finishing the half much better. That's why the goal we conceded just from the corner has hurt me because we were in a good moment.",

      "\"When United went 3-2 down, Ruben Amorim then went to 4-4-2 and did the right thing. Forget the system, he did the right thing. He got the right players on the pitch and were a massive threat.",
      "\"The second half was absolute mayhem. There were big boos after the West Ham and Everton games but there weren't the big boos here after this game. There was disappointment but there were a lot of fans we've just seen who stayed in the stadium to clap the team because they can live with that.",
      "\"If you're a kid coming to United - my two girls have come tonight, and they'll be thrilled walking back. They won't be happy that United haven't won, but they'll have seen a great game of football and that's what you come to Old Trafford for.",
      "\"You come for entertainment. Of course you come to see your team win, and I get it, you've got to go and win games, win trophies, win titles and we could say it's not good enough in respect of what's happened, but I think getting the entertainment bit right, the performance and style right, is absolutely critical at this football club.",
      "\"I enjoyed what I've seen tonight from those red shirts.\"",
      "\"It's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There as lots of that.",
      "\"But clean sheets are a big problem for them. They had problems at both ends of the pitch last season.",
      "\"We highlighted pre-match that they're improving in attack and we saw that again tonight. I thought the attacking players for Manchester United were fantastic.",
      "\"They had a lot of young defenders out there tonight that didn't help. I've been there, more often than not when you make a mistake as a young defender, it ends up in the back of your goal and that was the mistake tonight.",
      "\"Even though it ended up at 4-4 and Bournemouth should have won it at the end, Manchester United were by far the better team.",
      "\"That was the first time in a long time, and certainly under Amorim, that I felt like I was watching how Manchester United should be.",
      "\"Just wave after wave of attacks, counter-attacks, and almost the opposition feel like they're getting sucked back into that box in front of the Stretford End. You can't get out.\"",

      "Gary Neville hails mid-game tactical tweaks from Ruben Amorim as Man Utd manager shows more flexibility in draw with Bournemouth but says 'big problems' remain",
      "Tuesday 16 December 2025 08:35, UK",
      "Gary Neville said Ruben Amorim finally got his system \"spot on\" during Manchester United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday Night Football - but the head coach was again left frustrated as he watched his side \"lose concentration\" to give up their lead three times at Old Trafford.",
      "And there appeared a new sense of fluidity not seen before by his United side to date.",
      "\"But Ruben Amorim has certainly done something different here tonight. Maybe it's Leny Yoro is coming over towards Antoine Semenyo.\"",
      "Later into the second half, with the hosts trailing 3-2, Amorim switched to a clear four-man defence with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Amad Diallo and Matheus Cunha either side of Bryan Mbeumo and substitute Benjamin Sesko in attack.",
      "\"We've been critical of Amorim for not having the right system and players on the pitch with the stubbornness for the system he plays, but in this period of the game, he's got it spot on,\" Neville said.",
      "\"The players you want on the pitch are there. Amad on the right, Mbeumo and Sesko up front, Cunha to the left, Mainoo and Fernandes as the midfield pair and then the back four.",
      "\"There's no excuses now.\"",
      "But for all their good play, United's continued inability to hold onto a lead saw them drop two more points through Eli Kroupi Jr's 84th-minute leveller, meaning they have let 10 points slip from winning positions this season - enough to put them joint top of the Premier League.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five,\" rued Amorim. \"It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game.",
      "\"You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "Carragher was similarly unimpressed by Manchester United's defending but felt the quality of their attacking, particularly before half-time, was as good as he had seen from an Amorim side in the 59 games since he joined the club.",
      "\"It's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim,\" he said. \"They were fantastic, especially in that first 25 or 30 minutes.",
      "\"It was almost a throwback to Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, with Gary Neville playing. Fast attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There were lots of that.\"",
      "On the club's ongoing lack of clean sheets - of which Amorim now has the seventh-worst ratio in Premier League history - Carragher added: \"It's a big problem for them. They had problems at both ends of the pitch last season.",
      "\"We highlighted pre-match that they're improving in attack and we saw that again tonight. I thought the attacking players for Manchester United were fantastic.",
      "\"They had a lot of young defenders out there tonight that didn't help. I've been there, more often than not when you make a mistake as a young defender, it ends up in the back of your goal and that was the mistake tonight.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Monday 15 December 2025 15:46, UK",
      "Morgan Rogers was Aston Villa's match-winner against West Ham on Sunday. Erling Haaland scored another two goals for Manchester City in their victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "But who is the Premier League's biggest game-changer?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically.",
      "Bruno Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough season for Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes's three goal involvements in Manchester United's last game against Wolves were the difference between a draw and a victory, winning the side two points. Before that, he won them three points by assisting both goals in the 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven of them have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo hasn't registered a goal involvement since scoring two goals and setting up another against Fulham in October but he still ranks third for points won, level with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 25 points after 15 games.",
      "Semenyo is second despite his recent goal involvement drought, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Mohamed Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed dip in form this season.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, has boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "And while Fernandes leads the way this term, Salah is undoubtedly the Premier League's biggest game-changer of the last 15 years.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Kobbie Mainoo can change his mind to become a starter as Casemiro did when he was behind Toby Collyer in the pecking order, but adds displacing Bruno Fernandes will be hard; Amorim says midfielder needs to be more defensive-minded to play alongside his captain",
      "Monday 15 December 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he is open to speaking to Kobbie Mainoo about his Manchester United future if the midfielder still wants to leave on loan in January.",
      "Mainoo, who requested a temporary switch in the summer, is yet to start a Premier League game this season, despite the United head coach saying he views the academy graduate \"as a starter like the other players\" after the 4-1 win at Wolves.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has infuriated club legends Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Nicky Butt who have all said the 20-year-old should leave United rather than waste his career waiting for opportunities.",
      "Mainoo started for England in the Euros final in July 2024 but his lack of playing time has left him out of the picture under Thomas Tuchel, with reports claiming he wants to join Napoli on loan to get into the World Cup squad.",
      "Asked if he would sanction a January loan move should Mainoo request it, Amorim said: \"If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.\"",
      "Amorim insists Mainoo's reduced role is solely down to the fact he is competing for a starting position with Bruno Fernandes, who he says is \"really hard to take out of the team\".",
      "United captain Fernandes has started every league game and only been taken off early twice, in the 87th minute against Chelsea and 85th minute at Liverpool, highlighting how limited the opportunities are for Mainoo to play in that position.",
      "Amorim believes Mainoo has the characteristics to play in the other role in his midfield pairing that Casemiro regularly occupies but says the 20-year-old needs to think more about his defensive duties if he is to make it his own with so many attackers in the team.",
      "\"If you look at our team with [Matheus] Cunha, Bryan [Mbeumo], Bruno [Fernandes], that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "Casemiro had to work hard to convince Amorim he should be a regular starter after initially being displaced by academy midfielder Toby Collyer last season.",
      "Collyer has been on loan at West Brom this season and struggled for game-time in the Championship before being sidelined with an injury that he is currently having treated at United.",
      "\"[Toby Collyer] is from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich and he's not playing,\" said Amorim, who has faced criticism for his use of the academy.",
      "\"He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.\"",
      "Asked if he actually rates Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, like everyone else. The problem is we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing.",
      "\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, Kobbie will have more minutes. Imagine that this happens. Someone in front is going to lose their spot. Sometimes it's just the moment.",
      "\"I think I proved that if you change my mind [you can get into the team]. Casemiro is the biggest example. He was behind Toby and now he is a starter.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"The door is open for any player to change my mind. But in the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbs, he had opportunities, especially last year.",
      "\"I just look at the team and try to win the next game. I will do that until the end.",
      "\"Kobbs is one more player that I understand all the interests. I understand how important it is. The hopes that you guys and English guys have. I also just want to win. If he's the right guy, I will put him in. No problem.\"",
      "Quite a few players over the past few days have had their say about Kobbie Mainoo over the last few days. I don't want to ask you about Mainoo again, but how frustrating is it for you to have ex-players and pundits having their say like this?",
      "\"I think it's normal. I think it's a fact that me as a manager of Manchester United, I think we are underachieving. We should have more points, especially this season. So I take it that naturally.",
      "\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and they see Manchester United with the standards that they lived here, always winning. So it's hard for them to see their club in this situation.",
      "\"About Kobbie, I can speak about Kobbie every press conference. Sometimes it's harder for me to speak after the game. It's always the same situation for me. All of them are the same.",
      "\"I know that for you guys, there are some players that you believe a lot and I believe a lot. But sometimes they have to make choices.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders in these games. We could change in the future. But Kobbie is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes. Sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "If Mainoo comes to you and says [a loan] is want I want in January, will you sanction that given how little play time he is getting?",
      "\"First of all, the team comes first. If Kobbie comes to me and talks to me, I will talk to him.",
      "\"I'm not going to say what I'm going to say to Kobbie, but I will be really pleased if Kobbie is coming to talk to me about that. I just want my players [to be] happy and understand that every individual has their goals. The frustration doesn't help anybody.",
      "\"But again, the focus is on this game. We will see if that happens.\"",
      "Have you not had that real conversation this season then in terms of him airing his frustrations?",
      "\"Not about that. I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him.\"",
      "Are you a manger that wants your players to discuss that?",
      "\"I'm completely open. I think that is clear.",
      "\"What I don't promise is to… I have my ideas. That is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it, but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",
      "Could Mainoo not play in Casemiro's position because Casemiro sometimes comes off after 65 minutes…?",
      "\"Yes, he can. Against West Ham was Manu [Ugarte] that comes for Bruno's position. Bruno goes up because I was feeling with 10 minutes [to go], it is going to be long balls and second balls. I was thinking about that.",
      "\"I think it was against Everton I took Casemiro out, and I put Kobbie in because we were trying to play a different game.",
      "\"He can play in that position but it's hard sometimes. If you look at our team with Cunha, Bryan, Bruno, that you guys say is a No 10, sometimes Kobbie Mainoo, you have to think, I'm the guy for blocking transitions, all these things.",
      "\"He needs to spend more time there, but he can be in the future in that position. So I don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"Toby and his injury, he's returning here. He's from the academy, he played here. Went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United, so sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation that's happened.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to be the future. We'll see after this match.\"",
      "Do you rate Mainoo as a footballer?",

      "\"Especially last year, everyone had. [Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in U21. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying, sack the manager. You can see that I'm not worried. In that time, everybody [said that].",
