      "Gabby Agbonlahor sounded off on his battles with Gary Neville, claiming that the former Manchester United defender \"wasn't quick or strong\" in the latter years of his career",
      "Gabby Agbonlahor says he found it easy playing against Gary Neville - admitting that he'd have loved to have come up against the Manchester United legend every week.",
      "The Aston Villa legend had many battles with the former Red Devils captain on and off the pitch and according to the ex-England star, he'd wish they were more regular thanks to the on-field success he had against the right-back.",
      "After Neville admitted on a recent episode of the Stick to Football podcast that Agbonlahor had once skinned him in a game, the talkSPORT pundit revealed while speaking exclusively to Mirror Sport, via AceOdds, that he found it easy coming up against the eight-time Premier League winner, albeit acknowledging that he'd not played him during his prime.",
      "\"I've said it before a bit tongue-in-cheek because he was at the latter stages of his career,\" Agbonlahor said. \"I didn't play against the prime Gary Neville, so I have to be fair in that. When I played against him, he was probably mid-thirties, I can imagine.",
      "\"Early thirties, mid-thirties, and he was that sort of defender that I would have loved to play against every week because he wasn't quick, he wasn't strong.\" Agbonlahor delved deeper into his success against Neville on the pitch, adding that he needed no skill to play against him due to his superior physical prowess.",
      "\"It was quite easy playing against him because I had him for strength. I could hold the ball up turn and just knock it past him. No skill was needed. The pace was obviously me being in my early twenties. Yeah, it was quite easy, but I could imagine any defender that's similar to Gary Neville's attributes in their mid-thirties, I would have skinned.",
      "\"Do you know what I mean? I have to be fair on that. His age was a factor but obviously, he had a fantastic career.\" The pair had been previously involved in a heated feud after Agbonlahor said Neville's ex-teammate Nemanja Vidic was the most overrated defender in Premier League history.",
      "The jibe forced the Englishman to hit back at the Villa icon by saying: \"A guy who's played against Man United 21 times and won once and f***ing shouts his mouth off in an interview,\" on an episode of the Stick to Football podcast earlier this year.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "The Premier League kicks off in Friday with new manager and players in action whilst leading figures have made changes to improve VAR's offside involvement and the way fans are engaged",
      "The Premier League will return this weekend and whilst some things don't change - plenty will.",
      "We have our constants - the Manchester City juggernaut aiming for another title, the newly promoted outfits battling to stay afloat and benefit from the riches on offer and the top four circus continuing with eight teams now in the hunt for the Champions League.",
      "The VAR madness is set to ensue with opinion still split on whether or not its even worth keeping the system, which seems to cause as much controversy as it solves. Changes are incoming - more on that later - which are supposed to streamline it somewhat.",
      "Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly continues to throw astronomical sums at the playing squad at Stamford Bridge. Almost without blinking they've spent more than £100m on new players this summer with the Blues desperate to become a trophy-winning force once again.",
      "They are all things we expected to happen and we'll likely have more of the same. In the 2024/25 season though we'll have plenty to get used to as changes - on and off the pitch - continue to come in. We take a look, before Manchester United against Fulham gets the campaign underway this Friday, at what we can all expect.",
      "As always, there's managers needing to make good first impressions - some more so than others. For the first time since late 2015 we have a top flight without Jurgen Klopp. Arne Slot is the man tasked with stepping in to the huge shoes at Anfield - and looks set to do so without making a signing.",
      "The merry-go-round at the Blues means that Enzo Maresca will be a Premier League manager for the first time, quitting Leicester to take on one of the most troubled and short-lived jobs in English football.",
      "Brighton waved goodbye to Roberto de Zerbi and went for another unknown name in Fabian Hürzeler. When they hired De Zerbi many asked 'who?' - but it was the Seagulls who got that one right - and they'll hope to have done so again. They now have a 31-year-old leading them after some impressive work in Germany. Julen Lopetegui is also back in England with West Ham whilst it'll be interesting to see how Kieran McKenna goes at Ipswich.",
      "I mean could it get any worse? For many the goal - or non-goal - scored by Luis Diaz at Tottenham still lingers in the memory. However we now have semi-automated offsides coming in - the system that we saw in the Euros - which will rid of all those line drawings.",
      "The new system is set to be launched during the first half of the season. Multiple cameras will track player movements and record data points on parts of the body that are relevant for an offside decision. It is expected to take an average of around 30 seconds off the length of time it currently takes and, to be honest, it did actually work pretty well at the Euros this summer.",
      "Admittedly we haven't had the blockbuster signings we've seen in previous years. The market has been slower than usual despite several stars emerging following the Euros. Man City and Liverpool haven't done anything major whilst Arsenal have only landed Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "The Red Devils signed Leny Yoro - only to see him get injured immediately - but remain hopeful of more additions. Aston Villa have landed the likes of Ian Maatsen as they prepare for a first Champions League campaign.",
      "Deadline day is still some time away though and the likes of Newcastle could yet show their financial might. Tottenham splurged more than £60m to land Dominic Solanke whilst West Ham have added new faces in Max Kilman and Aaron Wan-Bissaka",
      "This is a new one, but could yet prove to be a hit if it improves transparency. The Premier League Match Centre has been set up on Twitter and will offer updates and reasoning on decisions that have been made by the VAR Hub - allowing fans to be way more involved.",
      "The Twitter page said: \"This page will provide live updates from Stockley Park including information directly from the VAR Hub. We will issue near-live updates on operational matters from all matches – including clarification on refereeing and VAR.\"",
      "They added that the intel communicated \"will be based on the factual information from the VAR Hub\" and added that, if need, \"additional information on Laws of the Game and VAR process from PGMOL experts will be communicated.\"",
      "The Premier League isn't for the feint hearted and this year there will no winter break with the season instead starting later to allow for a greater summer rest period. Last year, for example, five games were held each weekend over a two-week period, giving teams at least one weekend off over January. The season prior to that there was a natural pause for the first ever winter World Cup in Qatar.",
      "All of Europe’s other big leagues will have a winter break, with England's top flight being the outlier. That is often a bone of contention for foreign managers, especially when they face the relentless festive scheduling. Get ready for the rants come early January.",
      "Last season we saw that breaking rules around spending is actually not the smartest idea. Both Everton and Nottingham Forest were deducted points, which forced them closer to the drop. The competition’s profitability and sustainability regulations are now keeping every club on their toes.",
      "This season is the final year of those regulations, with two new forms of spending caps being trialed ahead of their introduction from next season.",
      "Initially a “Squad Cost Rules” system will be tried - which will limit spending on players to 85% of a club’s football revenue and net profit or loss on player sales. A second system called “Top to Bottom Anchoring” limits spending to a multiple of the lowest combined prize money and cash from TV rights forecast to be earned by a team.",

      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has overseen two major deals for United this summer with Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro joining the Red Devils - and more could be on the way",
      "Manchester United legend Teddy Sheringham has taken a swipe at Sir Jim Ratcliffe for lacking \"ambition\" in the transfer market despite the club's active summer.",
      "The Red Devils have been splashing the cash this summer, securing Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5million and Leny Yoro from Lille for a cool £58.9million. Rumours are also swirling that deals for Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt could be sealed imminently in a £51.5million double swoop.",
      "Yet, Sheringham, a key figure in United's treble-winning 1999 squad, isn't convinced these signings will change United's fortunes in the league. The club icon also took aim at Ratcliffe's involvement with the club, suggesting his hands-on approach \"doesn't mean anything\".",
      "The former striker didn't mince his words, expressing doubts over whether the new signings would mesh well with Erik ten Hag's vision for the team, reports the Manchester Evening News. In a candid interview, Sheringham also blasted the new United hierarchy, doubting their ability to influence the team's performance on the pitch.",
      "Speaking to onlinepoker.ltd, he said: \"From my point of view, having a new football structure and Jim Ratcliffe involved as a minority owner doesn't mean anything. It doesn't even touch the sides, and it won't have any significant impact on what happens on the grass.",
      "\"It's just a new man putting money into the football club. Bringing in a new CEO and football executives won't improve the players or the manager. I can't see the new owners showing their ambition by bringing in a player that is going to have a transformative effect on the football club.\"",
      "The ex-forward also doubted the potential influence the arrival of top brass would have on the pitch, particularly when it comes to a major leap in performance. United made headlines over the weekend, finally clinching a deal with Bayern Munich for Mazraoui and De Ligt as Erik Ten Hag seeks defensive reinforcements.",
      "Despite the duo's significant Ajax pedigree and relationship with Ten Hag, Sheringham seems unconvinced that these moves signal a dynamic shift by United in the transfer market. He pointedly critiqued the acquisition of relative newcomers like Zirkzee, 23, and Yoro, 18, suggesting that their lack of experience might not make the quick impact fans are hoping for.",
      "\"The business that United have concluded so far isn't going to shift the needle. Yoro and Zirkzee are both young guys who will need time to adapt to the demands of Premier League football. There are no guarantees that they will be good signings - you don't know what you will get from them,\" he said.",
      "This summer's transfer window buzz at United also continues with rumours swirling about more potential signings as Ten Hag aims to bolster the squad. Nonetheless, Sheringham has called out for recruits capable of consistent top-tier performances, underlining that the Red Devils require dependability rather than \"inconsistencies\", adding: \"They're going to be inconsistent. Manchester United do not need any more inconsistencies, they need proper players that are going to give you an eight, nine or ten out of ten performance every week.\"",

      "In a bizarre NFL-Premier League crossover, the Indianapolis Colts have taken to TikTok to mock Manchester United's struggling winger Antony. The American football team posted a slideshow on the social media platform, poking fun at the Brazilian player.",
      "The first image in the series featured quarterback Anthony Richardson with a quote saying \"Leicester City had the greatest underdog story...\", referencing Leicester's unexpected Premier League title win in 2015/16. The next snap showed running back Jonathan Taylor with a caption that read \"No, Morocco did...\", alluding to their surprising run to the semi-finals of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.",
      "The final slide was a photoshopped image of Antony's face on Lionel Messi holding the Ballon d'Or, with the text simply reading \"..\". The post's caption read \"1 nomination, 1 trophy\", accompanied by several fire emojis.",
      "The Colts, who boast 1.1 million followers, usually stick to posting NFL training camp content on TikTok during the offseason, typically with a Gen Z twist. Their video mocking Antony racked up over 200,000 views within the first day.",
      "\"Antony to the Colts here we land,\" read the top comment, a nod to TikToker WinnerTshipa. \"No way the Colts are posting Antony,\" another user wrote.",
      "Since his transfer to former Premier League heavyweights Manchester United in the summer of 2022, for a fee of £86m Antony has failed to meet expectations. Despite high expectations of a successful partnership with his former manager Erik ten Hag, the Brazilian winger has only managed to net five league goals so far in his tenure as a Red Devils player.",
      "The Colts aren't alone in using the slideshow model as a means to share unrelated content. The Brooklyn Nets, despite their low NBA standings last season, have amassed over 2.7 million followers on TikTok through such posts. A recent post from July showcased guard Cam Thomas discussing Joker origin stories before eventually poking fun at \"Mr. Lagoon\". This post alone has garnered over 20 million views.",
      "The Colts narrowly missed out on victory in their preseason opener, losing 34-30 to the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Anthony Richardson only attempted four passes, successfully completing two for a total of 25 yards. Taylor carried the ball twice for four yards and will be aiming to bounce back from a 2023 NFL season marred by contract disputes.",
      "Indianapolis will continue their preseason with a game against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday, August 17. They kick off their 2024 NFL season by hosting the Houston Texans on September 8."

      "Manchester United are one of the busiest clubs in the Premier League as the summer transfer window picks up pace.",
      "United completed lots of important business on Tuesday with Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s £15million move to West Ham confirmed. His departure – which required United to fork out a sizable fee – has paved the way for the arrivals of Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt after the Bayern Munich defensive pair were announced on Tuesday evening in a £51.5m double deal.",
      "Their arrivals will come just in time for the start of the season, which begins against Fulham on Friday night at Old Trafford. There is still much more work to be done, however, with a few more incomings and outgoings expected before the window closes on August 31.",
      "Here  Mirror Football  takes a look over the latest headlines and gossip involving Erik ten Hag’s side.",
      "United’s interest in Frenkie de Jong has been long standing and with two of his former Ajax team-mates arriving at Old Trafford, the rumours are back swirling. United have reportedly already seen a €50m (£42.9m) bid for De Jong rejected by Barcelona, but Nacional claim they remain keen.",
      "Well, that interest is not reciprocated, with the Dutch midfielder excited about playing under his new manager this season. \"Staying at Barca? Yes, I’m very happy in Barcelona with my family, for sure,\" De Jong said. \"Hansi Flick wants me to be key. I talked to him. It was good.\"",
      "Ten Hag is a huge fan of De Jong, who played under his management at Ajax, but it seems as though he won’t be able to get the entire band back together.",
      "Wan-Bissaka’s exit was necessary for United, who needed to free up space in the squad for De Ligt and Mazraoui, but it’s clear that his presence will be missed among the squad. You only need to take one look at the comments underneath his parting message on Instagram to see how popular he is.",
      "Jadon Sancho wrote: “My family! All the best brother!” Marcus Rashford added: “Good luck my bro”. Wan-Bissaka made 190 appearances over five years for the club and paid tribute to everyone who made his time there so memorable.",
      "“To everyone associated with Manchester United, thank you. You’ve helped me fulfil so many dreams of mine & I leave the club with memories to last me a lifetime,” Wan-Bissaka wrote. “I’m so grateful for the love, help and support I’ve had from players & staff during the last 5 years and wish you all nothing but the best.”",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "Graeme Souness has cast doubt on De Ligt’s ability, suggesting he is too “lightweight” to succeed in the Premier League. De Ligt is arriving at United because Ten Hag wanted another Ajax reunion at Old Trafford, but former Liverpool captain Souness isn’t convinced.",
      "“I’m doubtful about De Ligt, I’m sorry,\" he told talkSPORT. \"When I look at him I see a lightweight centre-half. What you want from a centre-half first and foremost is to defend. It would appear that some coaches and managers think it’s all about playing out from the back.\"",
      "De Ligt has become the second centre-back to arrive this summer, following the £58m capture of Leny Yoro from Lille. It comes after United allowed Raphael Varane to leave upon the expiry of his contract and sold Willy Kambwala to Villarreal for a fee which could reach £9.7m.",

      "Marcus Rashford's potential move to PSG has already been approved by the player he'll replace in France - new Real Madrid signing Kylian Mbappe.",
      "The United forward was once thought of as an untouchable asset, but a recent drop in production has seen him fall further and further out of form, despite Erik ten Hag's encouragement.",
      "Rashford failed to secure a place in Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad, and as a result, his name has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford, specifically to PSG.",
      "Mbappe left Les Parisiens in a blockbuster move to Champions League holders Real Madrid, and Rashford could be recruited to replace him. The French world-beater has previously praised the Red Devil and believes he could do a good job of filling his boots.",
      "The two crossed paths in the 2019 Champions League. A Romelu Lukaku double and a 94th-minute dagger penalty from the Englishman were enough to overcome a 2-0 first-leg deficit and eliminate PSG.",
      "Mbappe sung Rashford's praises post-match: \"When you take a penalty in that situation, how much practice you have put on the training ground doesn’t matter.",
      "\"It’s about confidence,\" added the Frenchman. \"He’s a player who plays with so much confidence. He’s one of the most dangerous forward players in England. Paul Pogba has spoken about how special he is – and he doesn’t talk about players in such a way often.\"",
      "Rashford added ten Premier League goals to his tally that season and registered some impressive numbers. He scored 17 league goals in 2020 and 21 in all competitions the year after. A disappointing five goals during the 21/22 season can be attributed to a shoulder injury and illnesses.",
      "On the back of a solid showing at the 2022 World Cup, he was expected to kick on under new boss Erik Ten Hag, and did, registering 30 goals in all competitions.",
      "However, Rashford disappointed last campaign. He started 26 league games but only notched seven goals. With Rasmus Hojlund brought to lead the line, Rashford featured out wide with only the lacklustre Antony to challenge him - if a competent deputy was at the club, the 26-year-old's game time could've been further reduced.",
      "Missing out on Euro 2024 and falling lower in Ten Hag's estimations has subsequently led to Rashford’s name swirling around the rumour mill this summer.",
      "Though it is improbable the player will depart his boyhood club, PSG have the financial power to make the deal happen. The Red Devils have reportedly put a £70m-plus price tag on Rashford, who was subject to interest from the French outfit in 2022.",
      "PSG have lost their global star and need a blockbuster new winger to replace him. With the departed Mbappe blessing the deal, Rashford could be the man to replace him, unlikely as it may seem.",

      "Anthony Martial has left Old Trafford this summer after nearly 10 years at Manchester United, and captain Bruno Fernandes inadvertently provided insight into the forward's departure",
      "Anthony Martial's inability to lock down a position at Manchester United could be why Erik ten Hag ousted him from the squad.",
      "The French forward made over 300 appearances and netted 90 goals during his nine-year United tenure after joining for what was a world record fee for a teenager in 2019.",
      "Martial's contract was allowed to expire this summer, and he is currently a free agent. The 28-year-old never entirely made a forward position his own at Old Trafford.",
      "Club captain Bruno Fernandes previously inadvertently cited this positional limbo as reasoning for Martial's departure, highlighting the forward's failure to score the necessary goals as a number nine and lack of assists when playing wide.",
      "\"With Marcus, there is always that kind of joke with him and Anto [Anthony Martial],\" Fernandes told the club in 2020. \"I say to them every time I pass to them, they never score.",
      "\"They never give me assists. You see again that Anto missed that chance against Leeds. Straight away, I looked at him and started smiling. He understands what I mean by that.",
      "\"I think it’s good, it’s positive. Of course, sometimes you have to shout at your team-mate and call him to do different things, that’s also a big part of the game, that you’re pushing a bit more for the other team-mates.\"",
      "The French ace made 19 appearances in all competitions under Ten Hag last season, scoring just twice. His season was cut short by groin surgery in February, but before this, he was primarily used as a substitute.",
      "There were times when it seemed Martial could have what it took to lead the Red Devils' line, though. During the 2019/20 season, he registered 17 league goals - including a hattrick against Sheffield United - and added a further six in other competitions.",
      "This was under old boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but upon Ten Hag's arrival, Martial started just two league matches before being shipped out on loan to La Liga outfit Sevilla in 2022.",
      "The issue Fernandes revealed - that Martial lacks true goalscoring instinct and cannot play as a prolific winger - perhaps resonated with Ten Hag.",
      "He may have felt that other players could more efficiently do the job Martial had been doing out wide, and brought in promising young marksman Rasmus Hojlund to score goals where the Frenchman disappointed.",
      "This summer, a very similar player to Martial was signed - £36.5m recruit Joshua Zirkzee. Ten Hag clearly believes that he has found pieces who can play Martial's role better, hence the decision to let him walk away for free.",

      "Paul Scholes has dubbed Matthijs de Ligt a \"second-rate\" signing for Manchester United as the Bayern Munich defender arrives for a medical, however, a former Red Devils team-mate disagrees",
      "Teddy Sheringham has dismissed Paul Scholes' rant over Manchester United's signing of Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "The Red Devils are on the brink of acquiring the 25-year-old from Bayern Munich in a deal worth a reported £43million, with the centre-half arriving in Manchester on Monday evening for a medical at Carrington. De Ligt fell out of favour in Bavaria recently, with former Spurs outcast Eric Dier starting in his place.",
      "The sturdy defender only joined Bayern from Juventus in 2022, but he's on the move once again - this time to England's north west. He comes as the third big summer signing for Erik ten Hag, with Leny Yoro joining from Lille for £58m and forward Joshua Zirkzee coming aboard from Bologna for £36.5m. De Ligt is also being joined by Munich team-mate Noussair Mazraoui at Old Trafford.",
      "However, a number of former Manchester United players have been critical of Ten Hag's vision with De Ligt, and midfield icon Scholes slammed the Dutchman as \"second-rate\". He said: \"You know what? Manchester United are talking about bringing players in who won’t get in their team.\"",
      "On De Ligt, he added: \"He’s not played for them. That’s a big concern for me, especially when Eric Dier’s playing in front of him. I’m not joking; that is a massive concern for me. You’re bringing in players for £40million, £50million, okay, just because he’s played for them three or four years ago.",
      "\"Juventus got rid of him; he wasn’t good enough at Juventus, he obviously hasn’t been good enough for Bayern Munich. He’s coming to us almost like a second-rate defender now.\" Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand pondered: \"He's had a lot of injuries, hasn't started many games over the last two or three years and Man United are spending £45-50million on him.",
      "\"Is he going to come into Man United and make a difference? I think it's a big ask for him and all eyes are going to be on him. Big pressure, big opportunity for him, but there's a lot of uncertainty I think with this signing because of his previous seasons with two big clubs not going as well as we'd have anticipated.\"",
      "However, another legend, Sheringham, has disagreed with presumptions about De Ligt, instead praising his leadership. The former United striker told OnlinePokerLTD: \"They need leaders. That’s why I like the rumours about Matthijs de Ligt, because even though he’s 24, he’s been there and done it winning titles in Holland, Italy and Germany. Leaders drag other people along with you.",
      "\"Manchester United don’t need any more young players making mistakes, or players that are learning their trade and doing okay. Doing okay for Man United is not good enough. You’ve got to be challenging. You’ve got to be up there. You’ve got to be demanding of what’s happening at your football club.",
      "\"I don’t see enough big players at the club who set the standard. I really like Martinez; I think he was missed last season. He’ll make a big difference for me. I think he’s a good leader for the team.\" Sheringham added: \"I like the signing of Matthijs de Ligt. Erik ten Hag made him the youngest ever captain of Ajax and he has played for some big clubs in Juventus and Bayern since he left Amsterdam.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "\"He brings leadership qualities, and he’s got that ability to bring the ball out of defence and pick a pass. He’s calm. I think he’s a really good signing.\"",
      "United could only muster a dismal eight-place finish during the 2023/24 campaign – the club's lowest-ever finish in the Premier League – and Ten Hag, along with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co, have clearly looked to bolster problem areas ahead of the new season.",

      "Manchester United could yet be tempted by a loan deal for Brentford forward Ivan Toney.",
      "The Bees have stood firm so far this summer, and require £60million to part ways with their star striker. The England international has less than a year on his contract and has shown no desire to extend his stay at the G-tech Stadium.",
      "No club has yet proved willing to meet that figure, with the possibility that patience could not prove beneficial for any suitor. At 28, Toney is an older forward that clubs such as Manchester United and Chelsea would not ideally target, though they have been interested in the striker, along with Arsenal.",
      "The Independent report that the Old Trafford side, like Chelsea, are willing to wait until nearer the end of the transfer window to potentially make a move. It is expected the Bees' position will be weakened at that stage and clubs could become creative.",
      "That could see Toney move for a reduced fee or even on loan as Brentford attempt to realise some of the former Newcastle forward's valuation. A loan offer for Toney, with an obligation to buy could yet be forthcoming it is reported.",
      "United are reluctant to spend a large figure on Toney's profile under their new recruitment team, with the club having been restricted by profit and sustainability rules too. While the club's priorities lie in midfield, after having signed the likes of Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, a forward remains of interest.",
      "Brentford boss Thomas Frank has admitted this summer that he would love Toney to stay despite the speculation. The Bees' head coach also confirmed that the former Peterborough star would not be let go cheaply due to his goalscoring status.",
      "\"You never know, he is a Brentford player. I would love him to stay. They'll give me a very positive challenge,\" Frank told Sky Sports last month.",
      "\"But, you know, I haven't met a coach that didn't want as many good players as possible. So right now, Ivan is a Brentford player.",
      "\"I know he's enjoying his time off, well deserved time off, after the time with England and I'm happy if he's here with us, I'll be more than happy at training.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of sealing a double deal for Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui, and there has been some disagreement over the Bayern Munich pair",
      "Micah Richards doesn't share Paul Scholes' concerns about Matthijs de Ligt as the Dutch international closes in on his move to Manchester United.",
      "De Ligt is set for a reunion with Erik ten Hag, the man who handed him the captain's armband at Ajax. It will see him continue a nomadic career since leaving Amsterdam, with his former Ajax colleague Noussair Mazraoui also poised to trade Bayern Munich for Old Trafford this summer.",
      "The incoming duo will help replace Raphael Varane and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, both of whom have moved on. Varane joined Como following the expiry of his United contract, while Wan-Bissaka has completed a £15m switch to West Ham.",
      "United have already signed Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro, though the latter will miss the start of the season through injury. That could open the door for De Ligt to earn starts early in the campaign, but questions remain - even if Richards is convinced.",
      "Speaking on The Rest is Football podcast, Richards suggested De Ligt could allow United to solve one of United's more consistent issues from last season. \"When we talk about Man United and the way they play, the structure of the team, sometimes they sit really deep because they’ve not got the pace,\"he said",
      "\"If you get De Ligt in the team… I wouldn’t say he’s rapid but he’s not as slow as someone like Maguire on the turn and that’s no disrespect to Maguire. So I think they can afford to be a bit more adventurous\"",
      "Summer signing Yoro appears to be an upgrade in the pace department, but is out of commission after picking up an injury in pre-season. United started with a centre-back pairing of Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans in the Community Shield, with Lisandro Martinez forced to start at left-back while Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia work their way back to match-fitness.",
      "Unlike his fellow pundit, Scholes remains unconvinced by De Ligt after following his Bayern spell. “[De Ligt] from Bayern Munich… he’s not played for them,\" he said on The Overlap Fan Debate. While De Ligt started last season in and out of the team, he played more regularly when fit towards its conclusion.",
      "\"That’s a big concern for me, especially when Eric Dier’s playing in front of him,\" Scholes continued. \"I’m not joking; that is a massive concern for me. You’re bringing in players for £40 million, £50 million, okay, just because he’s played for them three or four years ago…",
      "\"Juventus got rid of him; he wasn’t good enough at Juventus, he obviously hasn’t been good enough for Bayern Munich. He’s coming to us almost like a second-rate defender now.\"",
      "United need to confirm the arrival of De Ligt and Mazraoui by Thursday lunchtime if the pair are to be available for the first weekend of the new Premier League season.

      "United begin their campaign against Fulham at Old Trafford on Friday night and appeared to have a major issue following the news that Luke Shaw will miss the start of the season with a calf injury. Shaw has struggled with injuries in the past year and his understudy, Tyrell Malacia, is still not ready to return after missing all of last season through injury.",
      "Thankfully for Erik ten Hag, United have managed to get the double deal over the line for Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt before the Fulham match. The club announced on Tuesday evening that they had completed the transfers for the two Bayern Munich defenders, who have joined for a combined £51.5million.",
      "And while Mazraoui is right-footed, is better known as a right-back and has come primarily to replace Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who has joined West Ham for £15m, he is also capable of playing at left-back. United sporting director Dan Ashworth made a point of noting that in United's statement upon his arrival.",
      "“Noussair is a dynamic, attacking full-back who can play on both the right and left side of defence,\" Ashworth said. \"His experience and versatility will make him an excellent addition to our squad. Having already won a number of trophies in his career, we know that Noussair’s winning mentality will be a real asset to the group as we work together to deliver the success required of Manchester United.”",

      "De Ligt could also go straight into the United team to face Fulham after signing a five-year contract with the option of a further year.

      "Erik ten Hag, aided by the decisions made by the club's new hierarchy, has spent nearly £150million on improving Manchester United this summer - but feels there is still one position left to fill",

      "Manchester United's unexpected FA Cup Final win over Manchester City showed he could mastermind success over their rivals in big one-off games. Ten Hag’s challenge now is to translate this to the Premier League and show United can sustain a prolonged campaign and qualify at least for the top four.",
      "He’s tried to strengthen United in attack, where he has landed Joshua Zirkzee, and at the back with the double capture of Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui meaning three defenders have come through the door following Leny Yoro's transfer.",
      "He needs to score more and concede fewer goals and this is their template for success.",
      "Andre Onana will continue as Ten Hag’s No.1 and his form was patchy last season. He will hope he can settle into his position and inject some much-needed solidity.",
      "Defence is key for ten Hag and he will want Matthjis de Ligt to partner Lisandro Martinez in his first choice centre-half pairing with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof taking a back seat. Jonny Evans has signed on again for what could be his final season and he, Maguire and Lindelof are likely to be gradually eased out.",
      "If they could find a buyer for either Maguire or Lindelof that would interest either player, they'd likely be gone already in truth.",
      "Ten Hag has big hopes for Leny Yoro and feels the Frenchman has the talent to develop into an automatic starter. Luke Shaw, will now miss the first few weeks of the season after picking up yet another injury. But Dan Ashworth has confirmed Noussair Mazraoui is an option to play there.",
      "At full strength he will do battle with Diogo Dalot for the starting right-back berth, but serious questions will now be asked over whether a new left back is needed.",
      "Ten Hag likes to play two holding midfielders and Kobbie Mainoo is a shoe-in after his rapid progress over the last 12 months. Not only is he a regular for United, he has emerged as a starter for England and his energy and vision are real plusses.",
      "The issue ten Hag has is who should play alongside him? At the minute it’s Casemiro or Scott McTominay and Ten Hag does not particularly want either. United have struggled to find takers for Casemiro because of his £350,000-a-week wages, while Fulham are keen on McTominay. Ten Hag must resolve this issue before the transfer window closes on August 30 and find a regular partner for Mainoo.",
      "As it stands, Casemiro will get the nod, but he needs to improve dramatically after a really disappointing 2023-24 season.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee will be expected to support Rasmus Hojlund and take some of the goalscoring burden from his shoulders. The Netherlands attacker is only young, but Ten Hag has great hopes for him as an alternative to the Dane.",
      "He could nominally start on the right of United’s attack, allowing Bruno Fernandes to play as a No.10 and Alejandro Garnacho to start on the left. Fernandes had arguably his best campaign for United last season and will be crucial for his goals, creativity and experience.",
      "Garnacho is hugely exciting on the left and he turned the Community Shield when he came on before City stole victory at the end. Hojlund again will expected to score the majority of goals and that’s a lot of pressure to dump on the shoulders of a 21-year-old.",
      "Then there is the question of Marcus Rashford? If he's at his best, then expect to see him start down the left with Garnacho, who increasingly can't be ignored, moving over to the right.",
      "That leaves the likes of Jadon Sancho, Antony and Amad all in reserve.",

      "De Ligt, 25, has put pen to paper on a five-year contract and could make his debut for United on Friday when the Red Devils begin their Premier League campaign at home to Fulham. United's outlay could rise to £42.9m as a result of £4.3m in potential add-ons.",
      "Having learned his trade under Erik ten Hag at Ajax, De Ligt has been brought in to remedy the Red Devils' defensive injury woes. The Netherlands international will be joined at Old Trafford by former Bayern team-mate Noussair Mazraoui, who also starred in Ten Hag's Ajax team, once the Morocco right-back completes a separate £12.9m deal.",
      "Despite only being a teenager, De Ligt captained Ten Hag's side that reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2019, famously beating both Real Madrid and Juventus before losing to Tottenham. The 25-year-old has been a long-term target for United, who failed to sign him two years ago when he moved from Italian giants Juventus, the club he'd left Ajax for.",
      "De Ligt chose to join Bayern in 2022 and after a productive first season in which they won the Bundesliga title, injuries scuppered his second term under Thomas Tuchel. Ten Hag hopes that De Ligt, who didn't make an appearance for his country at Euro 2024, will rediscover his best form at Old Trafford, particularly in light of £52m signing Leny Yoro picking up a serious foot injury in pre-season.",
      "The defender actually confirmed the transfer before the club, penning an emotional letter to Bayern fans. “Dear Bayern fans, I want to thank each and everyone of you for all your love and support. I have spent two amazing years playing for this beautiful club. It has been a true honour to have played for a club like Bayern Munich.",
      "\"We have achieved unforgettable moments together. Winning the title as well as several amazing CL- nights. These memories will stay with me forever.",
      "“This is why leaving this club feels bittersweet. I will always remember the love and support I have received from the players, the staff members and from the fans. The recent petition signed by so many of you has touched me deeply.",
      "“Thank you all for the two amazing years. I wish FC Bayern good luck winning many more titles, like Bayern has always done. Mia San Mia.”",
      "Your turn! Will Matthijs de Ligt be a success at Manchester United? Let us know your prediction in the comments section",
      "And upon the official announcement, he said: “As soon as I heard that Manchester United wanted me, I felt an excitement about the opportunity for a new challenge at such an historic club. In the conversations that followed, I was impressed by the vision that the football leadership set out, and the role they saw for me in it.",
      "“Erik ten Hag shaped the early stages of my career, so he knows how to get the best out of me and I cannot wait to work with him again. I know what it takes to succeed at the highest level, and I’m determined to continue that record at this special club.”",
      "United's defence was decimated by injuries throughout last season and their lack of senior options for their defeat to Manchester City in the Community Shield on Saturday reinforced the need for additions. \"It's clear we have the problems,\" Ten Hag admitted after losing to City on penalties.",
      "\"We have to work, the players have to work to be available and the staff have to work. Together it should be a good collaboration with the players who are available.\"",
      "Mazraoui follows De Ligt in making the journey from Bavaria to Manchester and signs on the dotted line just hours after Aaron Wan-Bissaka's exit was confirmed. Wan-Bissaka signed for West Ham on Tuesday, admitting the decision to swap Old Trafford for the London Stadium was a 'no brainer'.",
      "Mazraoui said: “It’s an incredible feeling to be a Manchester United player, and I cannot wait to walk out at Old Trafford wearing the red shirt. I know that I’m joining the club at an exciting time; everyone I’ve spoken to has the same ambition for us to win trophies together and I can feel the determination to achieve that.”",
      "And Sporting Director Dan Ashworth has suggested Mazraoui could help out at left back in the early weeks of the new season. That follows the news that Luke Shaw will be sidelined until at least the first international break of the season.",
      "He said: “Noussair is a dynamic, attacking full-back who can play on both the right and left side of defence. His experience and versatility will make him an excellent addition to our squad.\"",

      "Manchester United fans have been left frustrated after defender Luke Shaw was ruled out for the start of the season.",
      "The Red Devils revealed the defender suffered an injury in pre-season training, having not long returned from his summer break after participating in Euro 2024. Shaw did not play in the Premier League from February until the end of last season due a hamstring injury before returning to feature for England in the latter stages of the European competition.",
      "Shaw joins the likes of Leny Yoro and Rasmus Hojlund on United's already problematic injury list. The 29-year-old is due to return in September following the international break should his rehabilitation go smoothly.",
      "United's statement read: \"Luke Shaw will miss the opening games of the Premier League season due to a calf injury sustained at the start of pre-season training.",
      "\"He is working hard on his rehabilitation with a view to being available after the first international break.\"",
      "Supporters are calling for a new signing before the close of the transfer window, such is their exasperation. \"Sell him now!! We’ve tried!! He’s not it,\" one fan said on X.",
      "\"As expected,\" added another. \"I still maintain that Luke Shaw shouldn't be a Manchester United player beyond 2024. A left-back should have been our priority instead of a right-back.\"",
      "\"This is shameful .. it’s time we move on from him,\" echoed another supporter, while a further one noted:‌ \"Time to move on from Shaw\".",
      "Shaw has previously expressed his frustrations over those who have questioned his commitment. The former Southampton ace revealed that he suffered his season-ending injury against Luton last term, in a situation where her probably should not have played.",
      "“I felt something against Aston Villa and came off at half-time. I didn’t train the whole week and when the scan came back, there wasn’t too much there,\" explained the United defender.",
      "“I then trained the day before the game (at Luton) - and if the manager asks me to play, I’m never going to say ‘no.’ But I shouldn’t have played. It’s kind of everyone’s fault. Partly my fault, partly the medical staff. I think everyone would admit that.”",
      "This summer has already seen United reinforce their backline. Yoro was signed from Lille, while Mattijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui are set to complete their transfers from Bayern Munich. The pair are to join in a double transfer worth £51.5million from the Allianz Arena.",

      "Roma forward Paulo Dybala could be an option for Manchester United this summer, but the Argentinian's wife will have a say in deciding her partner's transfer fate",
      "Star forward Paulo Dybala would be a bargain coup for Manchester United this summer – and his wife could help with pulling off a transfer.",
      "Roma are seemingly open to the idea of selling their World Cup-winner this summer, with only one year remaining on his contract in Italy's capital. That could be of interest to United boss Erik ten Hag, who is set to start the Premier League season without injured Rasmus Hojlund, while summer signing Joshua Zirkzee is still getting back to full fitness.",
      "It may also interest the Red Devils to learn Saudi Arabia seemingly won't be in competition for the player's signature. That's after Gazzetta dello Sport reported Dybala's wife - the model and actress, Oriana Sabatini - isn't interested in uprooting their lives for a completely new culture in the Middle East.",
      "Saudi outfit Al-Qadsiah reportedly made an offer to sign Dybala when the £10million release clause in his contract was still valid in July. The Giallorossi are back in full control of any sale now that deadline has passed, meaning United have already missed their chance at maximum value for a player who's reportedly been on their radar for years.",
      "Dybala, 30, has enjoyed moderate success at Roma after scoring 34 goals across 77 appearances for the club. And manager Daniele De Rossi acknowledged sales are very plausible following a pre-season clash against Everton on English soil.",
      "“Surely we have too many players, I had 31 at St. George’s Park,\" club legend De Rossi told Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Some players will leave and play elsewhere, like in other Serie A clubs. You can’t work well with 31 players. If somebody goes, then we’ll focus on new signings.”",
      "Roma's need to trim their ranks could also play in United's favour should Ten Hag deem it necessary to add more attacking reinforcements. Hojlund, 21, is set to be out until mid-September following injury on the club's summer tour of the US, while new man Zirkzee featured only sparingly in pre-season.",
      "\"Those who came to England are all Roma players, then we’ll see what happens,\" he continued. \"This is true not only for Dybala but for everyone. When I was asked if there were players who should stay at all costs, I said no. Whoever wants to leave is free to do it.”",
      "Those comments suggest former Juventus and Palermo forward Dybala will be granted an exit from the club should he want one and a club meets their payment expectations. And with Saudi seemingly out of the picture, genuine competition for the player's signature could be hard to come by.",

      "Wan-Bissaka has ended his five-year stay at United by joining West Ham in a £15million transfer. The right-back leaves after making 190 appearances for the club since his £50m move from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2019.",
      "His exit will help pave the way for the arrivals of Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt from Bayern Munich in the coming days. Wan-Bissaka’s departure had been pending for some time, with the 26-year-old having lost his first-team place to Diogo Dalot, but he was clearly a popular member of Erik ten Hag’s squad.",
      "“To everyone associated with Manchester United, thank you. You’ve helped me fulfil so many dreams of mine & I leave the club with memories to last me a lifetime,” Wan-Bissaka wrote on Instagram. “I’m so grateful for the love, help and support I’ve had from players & staff during the last 5 years and wish you all nothing but the best.",
      "“Thank you to the fans, you’ve stuck by us throughout the ups and downs. Appreciate you. Thank you so much, Reds.”",

      "Mazraoui is joining United as part of a £51.5m double transfer with De Ligt from Bayern and will take Wan-Bissaka’s place at right-back.

      "“I think before, it was just being left to play the game. But since I've been under him, the manager has taught me a lot. And you just want to improve more and keep learning more, especially from someone like him. So I've enjoyed that.",

The German sportswear brand has designed five all-new third jerseys for Manchester United, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus to commemorate its upcoming 75th anniversary.",

      "The Premier League have announced their refereeing appointments for the first game of the season and Mikel Arteta is unlikely to be happy when he finds out who is in charge of Arsenal's clash with Wolves",
      "The Premier League has confirmed their refereeing appointments for the first round of the new season, with Mikel Arteta set to be reunited with an old foe.",
      "Arteta has had frequent run-ins with officials ever since he took charge of Arsenal back in December 2019. That will likely be no different in the upcoming campaign, with the Gunners expected to once again challenge for the title.",
      "They start their season with a visit from Wolves on Saturday, with the Midlands side having not beaten them since February 2021. But Arteta will have to contend with Jarred Gillett acting as referee.",
      "The duo infamously clashed last season during a defeat to Aston Villa, which Gillett was in the middle for. Arteta claimed the Australian had made two major errors, ruling Kai Havertz's late equaliser out for handball after previously turning down an earlier shout for a penalty from the Gunners.",
      "When asked about the decisions by Sky Sports, he initially refused to comment, but when pressed if he had an opinion on the decision stated simply: “I do, a big opinion.” He later told Match of the Day: “It’s clear and obvious for me”.",
      "The Spaniard was immediately asked about both decisions when he entered his post-match press conference, to which he merely responded: “Clear and obvious”. Asked to clarify he reiterated: \"That's what I mean, clear and obvious. That's my opinion, that's all I can say.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United and Fulham kick off the new season on Friday night, with Rob Jones the referee. Newly promoted Ipswich Town host Liverpool in the weekend's second game on Saturday lunchtime, with Tim Robinson on duty.",
      "Simon Hooper will take charge of Brighton's trip to Everton, while Craig Pawson will be in tthe middle for Newcastle's clash against Southampton. The final 3pm kick-off will be handled by Michael Oliver at Nottingham Forest's game against Bournemouth.",
      "Meanwhile, Tony Harrington will oversee Villa's visit to West Ham in the 5.30pm slot. The first 'Super Sunday' of the season will see Sam Barrott referee Brentford's clash with Crystal Palace.",
      "Anthony Taylor has been handed the responsibility for the weekend's bumper tie, as he will oversee Manchester City's trip to Chelsea. Last season, City boss Pep Guardiola sarcastically hit out at the official following his side's 3-3 draw with Tottenham.",
      "Guardiola was left furious with a decision and when asked if Taylor had given him an explanation, the Spaniard told beIN Sports: \"No, the master of commander Anthony Taylor knows everything in this business and didn't tell me anything.\"",
      "The final game of round one will come from the King Power Stadium, where Leicester return to the Premier League with a visit from Tottenham. Chris Kavanagh has been handed the whistle for that one.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy has wasted no time in making his mark back at Old Trafford after arriving as part of manager Erik ten Hag's new-look staff",
      "Almost two decades after he first left Manchester United, Ruud van Nistelrooy is once again grabbing headlines at Old Trafford.",
      "However, it's not the Dutchman's finishing that's firing up the Red Devils these days; rather, it's the wisdom he's imparting upon the current stable of striker talent at Erik ten Hag's disposal. That's after United cut ties with another former Premier League hitman, Benni McCarthy, to bring a club legend back into their ranks as Ten Hag's assistant.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, 48, already appears to have built a rapport with certain players and was seen encouraging Marcus Rashford after the forward missed a big chance in the Community Shield defeat by Manchester City on penalties. Reserve goalkeeper Tom Heaton also recently praised the comeback king and referred to his coaching as \"outstanding\" not long after his arrival.",
      "The Daily Mail reported in July that Van Nistelrooy - who scored 150 goals in five years at United - took a leading role in training on their pre-season tour of the United States. Like Ten Hag, the Red Devils icon left an Eredivisie manager role (at PSV) to complete his return to United, so it makes sense he'd expect to maintain a prominent voice in his new surroundings.",
      "Despite the club coup, it came at the cost of a well-liked staff figure in McCarthy, who was one of Ten Hag's first coaching appointments in the summer of 2022. The ex-Blackburn and West Ham striker served as a first-team coach at United, while Van Nistelrooy is one of Ten Hag's two assistants, but many of their priorities helping the attack may overlap.",
      "That being said, Heaton has also highlighted his former team-mate's influence on the defensive side of things, \"because he understands that side of it too.\" And that should aid the Dutch-born defensive duo of Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui once their moves are made official.",
      "Rashford was highly complimentary of McCarthy's impact at Old Trafford and told SuperSport in March 2023: \"I think he has done a good job. It's always good for us to have a particular coach that concentrates on us as a forwards group. We have worked more as a team going forward which has led us to creating more chances and scoring more goals.\"",
      "Given his predatory scent for the goal during his playing days, it aligns that Van Nistelrooy should be in little mood to waste time back at his former stomping ground. The veteran won a Premier League title, FA Cup and League Cup during his time at Old Trafford but left following a fallout with Sir Alex Ferguson's then-assistant, Carlos Queiroz.",
      "Now in the No. 2 role himself, Van Nistelrooy will seek to succeed where Queiroz perhaps did not as he looks to shepherd Rashford & Co to new heights. He has his work cut out for him considering United's decline since old boss Ferguson departed, but there are few alumni better qualified to reignite the revival - and it's already showing.",

      "Gary Neville has previously spoken about the importance of having a consistent back four at Manchester United - which is going to be shaken up once again this season",
      "Gary Neville has long expressed concerns about Manchester United's lack of defensive unity - a worry that could be heightened by their imminent double signing.",
      "Bayern Munich pair Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui completed their medicals on Monday (August 12) before their expected moves to Old Trafford. If they sign on the dotted line in time, both could make their debut in United's Premier League opener against Fulham on Friday (August 16).",
      "They've each previously played under Erik ten Hag at Ajax and are likely to become key components in the Dutchman's defensive strategy. Ten Hag has struggled to field a consistent backline due to a mix of form and injury problems, with Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, and Victor Lindelof all sidelined at different times last season.",
      "The addition of De Ligt and Mazraoui could offer more stability in the long run, even if it means more adjustments in the short term. This will necessitate the formation of new partnerships along the backline - a point Neville has previously emphasised, particularly in relation to Diogo Dalot, who may now find his position in the team under threat.",
      "He heaped praise on the Portugal international's assist to Scott McTominay for United's winning goal against Aston Villa last season. During his podcast, the former England right-back highlighted the 25-year-old's potential, emphasising his physical attributes and footballing skills.",
      "He remarked on the Gary Neville Podcast: \"Dalot is someone that people say about the 'right back for the future' for Manchester United - they may have the right back for the future there. There is a lot there; he's six foot, he's strong, he's powerful, he's good on the ball, he's not a bad defender, I think he defends his back post really well, he opens up his shoulders.",
      "\"I think if he can start playing in a really confident back four and a settled back four... it's always changing and he's never really got a constant presence outside of him on that right hand side I had that for years, where I could build a relationship!",
      "\"Dalot, I think, is someone that you talk about 'could he' be the one that you think, you'll give him that shot. He's getting that shot at the moment but I wouldn't be too quickly looking to change him, I think he's something to work with.\"",
      "Reports claim United have agreed a deal with Bayern worth €50m (£42.9m) for Dutch defender De Ligt, €45m (£38.6m) of that paid over three years with €5m (£4.3m) in add-ons. Morocco international Mazraoui, meanwhile, is moving in a £17.2m deal which is an initial £12.9m plus performance-related bonuses worth £4.3m.",

      "It adds some much needed depth to the United defensive line whose inconsistency throughout the campaign last season proved to be a thorn in the club's side amid a host of injuries. That front hasn't particularly improved however, with the club announcing that Luke Shaw will miss the first few games of the Premier League season with a calf issue.",

      "He spent five years at Old Trafford, playing 190 games.",
      "\"At times, Erik ten Hag has taken a cautious approach with new additions, refusing to throw them straight into the team. Casemiro, who was a post-pre-season signing, made his first four United appearances via the bench, eventually earning a start after the Reds were cut to shreds by City in a 6-3 defeat at the Etihad Stadium in October 2022. At the same time, however, Ten Hag has occasionally thrown new additions straight in. Antony made his debut from the start just three days after finalising his move from Ajax, marking the occasion with a goal in a 3-1 win over Arsenal, and Wout Weghorst made his bow in the first game he was available for, starting a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace in January 2023.\"",

      "Elsewhere, according to the Daily Mail, United have decided they will not spend any more than £60m to bring Jarrad Branthwaite to the club before August 30. The Everton defender had been one of Ten Hag's priority targets earlier in the summer, but the Toffees rejected two bids.",

      "If Manchester United's supporters are anticipating a flying start against Fulham on Friday night, recent history shows they should not get too carried away.",
      "United have been slow starters in each of their first two Premier League campaigns under Erik ten Hag, losing their opening two games in 2022/23 and limping their way to a fortunate 1-0 victory over Wolves in their opening game last season.",
      "The Reds were second best for long spells against the Black Country outfit in last season's curtain-raiser, conceding 23 shots. Had Wolves remembered to pack their shooting boots, United would have started the season with another home defeat.",
      "United, just as they did in 2022 and 2023, head into their season opener as favourites to get off to a winning start. Although results have been indifferent in recent weeks, performances during pre-season, plus at Wembley on Saturday, have been encouraging.",
      "However, scoring goals has not come naturally for Ten Hag's men, highlighted by their tally of seven from their six warm-up matches. United worked some terrific openings against Manchester City in the Community Shield but only found the back of the net once, highlighting just how big a hole Rasmus Hojlund leaves up front.",
      "The Dane is going to miss the start of the season after suffering a hamstring injury in pre-season. He faces up to six weeks out, meaning the earliest he could return is September.",
      "United bolstered their attack last month, swooping for Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna. However, he has since admitted that he is not a direct replacement for Hojlund, insisting he is not a natural No.9 and that he prefers to play as a secondary striker, linking the midfield with the attack.",
      "He failed to make it off the bench against City, meaning he is still awaiting his debut, and it is unlikely that Ten Hag will throw him straight in from the off against the Cottagers. Bruno Fernandes started as a 'false nine' against City and it is likely he will operate in the same role against Fulham.",
      "If that proves to be the case, United will start their Premier League opener for the third season running without an out-and-out centre-forward on the pitch; Christian Eriksen operated as a 'false nine' in a failed experiment against Brighton & Hove Albion two years ago and Marcus Rashford led the attack 12 months ago.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",
      "With Ultra HD included at no extra cost, football fans can enjoy the 2024/25 season with crystal clear picture quality.",
      "£43",
      "United had added Hojlund to their squad ahead of the start of last season but he was unavailable after arriving from Atalanta injured. Anthony Martial, who is still without a new club after leaving Old Trafford in June, did not start until the third game of the season.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he prefers to play out wide, meaning United were at a disadvantage at the start of last season. Alejandro Garnacho and Antony started the opening two games on the flanks.",
      "Ten Hag has a dilemma to solve in the wide areas, with Rashford, Garnacho and Amad all in the running for a starting berth. Through the middle, however, it already feels fairly clear-cut that Fernandes will get the nod, having started as a 'false nine' against City.",
      "Ten Hag has often banged the drum about being without key personnel from his first choice starting XI because of injury issues, and that will be the case once again against Marco Silva's men. Fernandes has the tactical understanding and the quality to play in the front line in Hojlund's absence, but it is not an ideal situation.",
      "United struggled when they lost Hojlund to a muscle injury in February, losing two of the three games he was absent for. It contributed to them missing out on the top four just as it looked as though they were getting themselves back in the hunt.",
      "Arguments have been put forward for United to try and sign another striker before the end of this summer's transfer window following Zirkzee's admission about not being an out and out No.9, but finances will ultimately dictate what is achievable on that front.",
      "Unfortunately for Ten Hag, however, he is set to face another season opener without a natural striker at his disposal.",

      "Harry Maguire became a pantomime villain after an awful 2021/22 season but nobody is laughing at the Manchester United defender anymore after a show of strength last term.",
      "Maguire was booed by Australian fans of United on tour during Erik ten Hag's first pre-season but he's put a few challenging years behind him and has moved forward. The last 12 months have seen a resurgent Maguire regain the trust of Ten Hag and a place in the team.",
      "He was the most dependable centre-back last season, he delivered excellent performances and the gloss was only taken by a few injuries. Maguire played through the pain barrier for United in the spring but finally succumbed to injury, which meant he was unavailable for the FA Cup final and the European Championship.",
      "\"I worked so hard throughout the year,\" Maguire told the MEN on pre-season tour this summer. \"To get myself in a position where I was in a really good position physically and in a really good position mentally to to play in the FA Cup final and then thinking about the Euros after that.",
      "\"To have an injury which was, to be honest, not a big injury – it was just a calf injury, but it was only a three-week injury, but I just had three setbacks with it. When I first did the injury (in early May), I thought I'd be fit for the FA Cup final. So I pushed myself for the final.",
      "\"And then I had a setback in the week leading up to the final, which ruled me out of it. At that time again, it was no problem, I was going to be fit for the Euros. Then I went away with England and I had another setback, so yeah, it was so frustrating.",
      "\"When I look back, I wish I had no chance with all of them, so I could have got my head around it. But I thought I was going to play in the cup final or be involved at some stage and I thought 100 per cent I'd be involved at the Euros. But it just didn't happen and maybe I just pushed myself to get back too early, but definitely it was the toughest moment of my career, definitely.\"",
      "Although Maguire was stripped of the captain's armband last year, he is still a leader at Carrington and personally greeted every academy player on the first day of pre-season. Now aged 31, Maguire has the experience to help younger players and enjoys doing so, something that he reflected upon when he was asked about new signing Leny Yoro.",
      "\"I must say I haven't trained too much with him,\" Maguires said last month. \"But I've seen clips and I've seen attributes in a centre back of an 18-year-old that you'd want, every single attribute he's got.",
      "\"We must remind ourselves he is really young. There are going to be mistakes but he has every attribute of a centre-back in the modern game, he has it. So I’m sure he’s going to have a bright future.",
      "\"It’s our job as senior centre backs, my job, to help him along, communicate well, let him know what to expect. There are going to be times where I’m sure he’ll feel the world is on top of him, there are also going to be times where he’s going to feel like the best player in the world. And that’s what this club brings.",
      "\"I think it’s really important us senior lads help the young boys at the club. You’re starting to see now there’s so much talent in this squad but they’re going to need to be guided in the right direction and I think that’s definitely a role of mine and other lads as well.\"",
      "The young players are the future of United but Maguire is the present. Not many expected that to still be the case in 2024, but he has fought his back to be regarded as a key player for the club again and is expected to start the new season's opening game against Fulham.",
      "The addition of Matthijs de Ligt adds competition to Maguire, Yoro, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans for minutes. Just like he did in the Community Shield, Martinez is likely to start at left-back against Fulham on Friday, which means Ten Hag could potentially pick Maguire to partner De Ligt in central defence.",
      "When Martinez relocates to centre-back, there will be a choice between De Ligt and Maguire to make and you'd be foolish to bet against the latter. He has remarkable resilience and an added incentive to perform because there is just one year left on his contract, although United do have the option of another year.",
      "It didn't make sense to sell Maguire this summer and he must fight not to be offloaded next year.",

      "The 25-year-old centre-back, who recently fell out of favour at the German club, is set to join the Red Devils in a £43million deal. He was spotted in Manchester on Monday evening for a medical at Carrington.",
      "De Ligt, who moved to Bayern from Juventus in 2022, is now set for another transfer - this time to the north west of England. He will be Erik ten Hag's third major summer signing, following Leny Yoro's £58m move from Lille and Joshua Zirkzee's £36.5m switch from Bologna.",
      "And the centre-half looks to also be joined by his Munich teammate Noussair Mazraoui. However, some former United players have questioned Ten Hag's decision to sign De Ligt. Midfield legend Scholes labelled the Dutch defender as \"second-rate\", saying: \"You know what? Manchester United are talking about bringing players in who won't get in their team.",
      "\"He's not played for them. That's a big concern for me, especially when Eric Dier's playing in front of him. I'm not joking; that is a massive concern for me. You're bringing in players for £40million, £50million, okay, just because he's played for them three or four years ago.",
      "\"Juventus got rid of him; he wasn't good enough at Juventus, he obviously hasn't been good enough for Bayern Munich. He's coming to us almost like a second-rate defender now.\" Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand separately added: \"He's had a lot of injuries, hasn't started many games over the last two or three years and Man United are spending £45-50million on him.",
      "\"Is he going to come into Man United and make a difference? I think it's a big ask for him and all eyes are going to be on him. Big pressure, big opportunity for him, but there's a lot of uncertainty I think with this signing because of his previous seasons with two big clubs not going as well as we'd have anticipated.\"",
      "But not all United icons feel the same way, with Sheringham giving an alternative take - instead praising De Ligt's leadership qualities: \"They need leaders. That's why I like the rumours about Matthijs de Ligt, because even though he's 24, he's been there and done it winning titles in Holland, Italy and Germany. Leaders drag other people along with you.",

      "\"Manchester United don't need any more young players making mistakes, or players that are learning their trade and doing okay. Doing okay for Man United is not good enough. You've got to be challenging. You've got to be up there. You've got to be demanding of what's happening at your football club.",
      "\"I don't see enough big players at the club who set the standard. I really like Martinez; I think he was missed last season. He'll make a big difference for me. I think he's a good leader for the team.\" He also added: \"I like the signing of Matthijs de Ligt. Erik ten Hag made him the youngest ever captain of Ajax and he has played for some big clubs in Juventus and Bayern since he left Amsterdam.",
      "\"He brings leadership qualities, and he's got that ability to bring the ball out of defence and pick a pass. He's calm. I think he's a really good signing.\"",

      "In a statement released by the club on their website, they wrote: \"Luke Shaw will miss the opening games of the Premier League season due to a calf injury sustained at the start of pre-season training. He is working hard on his rehabilitation with a view to being available after the first international break.\"",
      "Throughout preseason, there's been the lingering question as to whether Shaw would be fit enough to start come the beginning of the 2024/25 campaign, which gets underway this Friday where United host Fulham in the opening match of the Premier League season.",
      "There were question marks around the star, who took three weeks off after England were beaten in Berlin, and who hasn't been pictured in training once since his return to Carrington last Monday. He also missed first-team training sessions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday ahead of Saturday's Community Shield match against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium.",

      "Just as Aaron Wan-Bissaka was packing his bags at the weekend, he was finally missed by Manchester United. The right back has form for dozing at the far post but would almost certainly have been more vigilant than makeshift right back Facundo Pellistri was for Bernardo Silva's equaliser.",
      "He will never play there for England but Wembley is a home from home for the London-born Wan-Bissaka. He was United's best player in their losing FA Cup final to Manchester City, was even better in the victorious final in May and neutered Allan Saint-Maximin of Newcastle and Brighton winger Kaoru Mitoma there last year.",
      "Saturday's appetiser for the new season was a rare occasion where Wan-Bissaka's absence was rued by United. He leaves five years on from his £50million transfer from Crystal Palace, apparently the best of the 804 right backs United scouted that summer.",
      "It was not Wan-Bissaka's choice to blurt that out. Ed Woodward played him a hospital pass with that tidbit and Wan-Bissaka never convinced when accepting the ball under pressure.",
      "Two goals and 13 assists in five years is a derisory return for a modern full back. Both of Wan-Bissaka's goals were tallied during the Covid-19 pandemic, so he never scored in front of United's supporters.",
      "He was only ever serenaded by them on his first tour in Singapore, where supporters chanted \"Bissaka\" and revelled in his spider tackles. In the final third, Wan-Bissaka was often tangled in a web.",
      "Of the assists, four were memorable or noteworthy. A couple of clipped crosses for Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial against Newcastle and Chelsea in the 2019-20 season, an adroit cut-back for Christian Eriksen against Burnley and a surge followed by a prompt pass for Scott McTominay at Galatasaray last year.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, insistent on signing a British right back, hoped the 2019 Boxing Day assist for Rashford was a sign of things to come. After two years, he had effectively given up on Wan-Bissaka as a United first-teamer.",
      "Solskjaer wanted another Brit, Kieran Trippier, in the summer of 2021. Trippier, a recent La Liga title winner with Atletico Madrid and starter for England in the European Championship semi-final, was not planning to join his boyhood club to sit on the bench. The move never materialised. United considered moves for Sergino Dest and Jeremie Frimpong in recent years before they turned to Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "A year later, United endeavoured to sell or loan Wan-Bissaka, only there were no takers. His fine form in the second half of the 2022-23 campaign, enabled by injury to Diogo Dalot, ensured he remained for one final year.",
      "With his contract up next year, Wan-Bissaka had to go this year. He had a variable but creditable career at United. Good first season, okayish second, dreadful third, a revived fourth and a poor fifth. He will get appreciative applause on his return to Old Trafford.",
      "His contributions in the two winning finals were immense. Saint-Maximin ran rings around Dalot in the first half of the 2023 League Cup final but hit a roadblock in Wan-Bissaka after the interval. Jérémy Doku was City's best player and got their goal in May but his duel with Wan-Bissaka was far from one-way.",
      "In the 2021 Europa League final, Solskjaer replaced Wan-Bissaka with Alex Telles in the 123rd minute as the Brazilian was more capable from the penalty spot. Playing in the opponent's half was never Wan-Bissaka's forte and there were red flags in his first months at United.",
      "On his first tour at the Optus Stadium in Perth, Paul Pogba urged Wan-Bissaka to venture forward. In the defeat at Bournemouth in November 2019, Wan-Bissaka made way for Ashley Young, 12 years his senior, as he was too reticent as United chased an equaliser.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was as cagy off the pitch. At an Adidas sponsorship event in Singapore in 2019, he declined to answer trivial questions and a United staff member conceded, \"This doesn't look good.\" A headline in Singapore's The New Paper read: 'United's rising star is a shy Wan'.",
      "Some teammates found Wan-Bissaka to be aloof. Players and staff sympathised amid his homesickness during his first months at United, a period that coincided with his only England squad inclusion in September 2019 (he withdrew from the camp).",
      "He is the only player a colleague has requested not to speak to in the mixed zone when Wan-Bissaka was offered by a press officer. During United's media day for the League Cup final, the second player interview was undecided. \"Don't worry, it won't be Wan-Bissaka,\" a staff member half-joked.",
      "United planned to arrange a one-on-one interview with Wan-Bissaka during the 2023 tour of the United States with a sympathetic and younger journalist. Trying to bring Wan-Bissaka out of his shell was as arduous as challenging to get a cross out of him.",
      "He was more at home at Wembley.",

      "Manchester United have launched their new white third kit. A more appropriate colour would have been orange.",
      "Erik ten Hag is not oblivious to the Dutchification of United. \"Believe it or not, his name (Matthijs de Ligt's) did not come from me in the process,\" he told AD last month.",
      "Yet Ten Hag tried to sign De Ligt in his first summer at United. De Ligt ticks all of the boxes: born in the Netherlands, played for Ajax and played for Ten Hag. As does Noussair Mazraoui (the Morocco international was born in the Netherlands).",
      "Bayern Munich board member Uli Hoeness wryly highlighted De Ligt's nationality. \"De Ligt is Dutch, the coach at Manchester United is Dutch.\"",
      "With De Ligt and Mazraoui, Ten Hag has an XI of United signings born, or who have played, in the Netherlands: Onana, Mazraoui, De Ligt, Martinez, Malacia, Amrabat, Mount, Eriksen, Antony, Zirkzee, Weghorst. They could even operate in an Ajax 4-3-3 formation. Jonny Evans played in the Amsterdam Tournament as a teenager, too.",
      "With a new co-chairman, a new chief executive, a new technical director and an inaugural sporting director, United are having a more Dutch-centric summer than the previous two.",
      "It is a quizzical strategy. Leny Yoro, who ticked none of the Dutch-themed boxes, was clearly an Ineos-led recruit, one for the club rather than the manager. De Ligt and Mazraoui are signings for the manager rather than the club.",
      "This was always going to be a fascinating season observing United and that has been fuelled by their recruitment. United unconvincingly decided to keep the manager after a 17-day end-of-season review, having touched base with every Tom, Dick and Harry. Then they merely triggered the one-year extension in his contract.",
      "The backing of the manager in the transfer market suggests there is significant trust. Only Ten Hag's hit rate is iffy. Lisandro Martinez has been the biggest success and his two years at United have been interrupted by four significant injury lay-offs.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat is inexplicably still listed as a United player when he is a Fiorentina player. Even if United do upgrade from a loan to a purchase, it is hardly a ringing endorsement with the final fortnight of the transfer window looming. Earlier this month, Ten Hag maintained Wout Weghorst, scorer of two tap-ins in 31 games, was a success. Tyrell Malacia will not play again until October.",
      "Amrabat's SEG International stablemate Rasmus Hojlund has to aim for a 20-goal season and that is doable with United relegated to the Europa League. People at United continue to speak hopefully about Mason Mount, a teenage loanee at Vitesse Arnhem, but he was back in underwhelming form against Manchester City.",
      "Andre Onana ought to be more dependable in his second season and there were promising glimpses of United's proactive possession play during pre-season and in the Community Shield. Sixteen passes were exchanged between all 11 players for Marcus Rashford's first-half chance at Wembley on Saturday.",
      "\"Be prepared,\" Onana told us at UCLA, vowing he will take more \"risks\". De Ligt, a fellow member of the captivating Ajax team that were seconds away from the Champions League final, will be a familiar shield for the Cameroonian.",
      "If Ten Hag had his way, he would have had the blond bombshells reunited in 2022. Donny van de Beek was already in situ and United agreed a fee with Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong.",
      "Van de Beek, a Dutch dud, has not been a deterrent. With De Ligt and Mazraoui, six of Ten Hag's additions have played for Ajax.",
      "De Ligt is an incoming based on his form five years ago rather than his form in the last five years. He was sent off in the Netherlands' ejection by the Czech Republic at the European Championship in 2021, he barely had a kick at the 2022 World Cup and did not have a kick at Euro 2024.",
      "Juventus won one title during De Ligt's three years and he started in only 23 of Bayern's 49 games last term. Had United replaced Ten Hag with the former Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel, there is no way De Ligt would be at Carrington right now.",
      "Ten Hag infamously claimed United would \"never\" play an Ajax style in October. The passing exchanges that fashioned chances for Rashford and Amad against City suggest otherwise.",
      "Casemiro was instrumental, venturing forward to supplement attacks and play in the aforementioned forwards. At Ten Hag's post-match press conference, a journalist quizzically suggested Casemiro had thrived in a new system. Ten Hag corrected him. \"I don’t think it’s about the system.\"",
      "Going from De Jong to Casemiro two years ago was not like-for-like and former football director John Murtough did the legwork on the £70million deal for Casemiro. The Brazilian demonstrated his piercing passing range in that influential first season and he appears to be a better attacking than defensive midfielder now.",
      "Perhaps that is Ten Hag's masterplan. In the absence of a new midfielder, bypass defensive organisation by playing on the front foot. It is a tall order for De Ligt, unsuccessful in Serie A and the Bundesliga, to be a success in the Premier League but he is a ball-playing centre back familiar with Ten Hag's demands. As is Martinez.",
      "If the future is bright, then it will be down to the Oranje.",

      "Graeme Souness believes Manchester United are overlooking four key concerns in their £43m signing of Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "The centre-back is on the brink of a move to Old Trafford, having flown in for his medical on Monday as part of a double deal alongside Bayern full-back Noussair Mazraoui. It will be intriguing to see how De Ligt fits into Erik ten Hag's plans, especially given his competition for place from Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans and new £59million man Leny Yoro.",
      "Under Ten Hag's watch at Ajax, De Ligt became captain of the Dutch giants as a teenager and emerged as one of the leading youngsters in world football. However, Souness feels that United are ignoring De Ligt's apparent lack of development since leaving Ajax for Juventus in 2019, with Bayern also willing to cash in on the Netherlands international.",
      "\"I'm doubtful about De Ligt. He didn't get into the national team during the Euros, he was a squad member,\" Souness told talkSPORT regarding his first concern. He then added: \"He's been at two enormous football clubs, they normally don't like to sell players. That in itself tells a story.\"",
      "Souness also pointed out: \"He was a star when he was a boy. Has he progressed since then? I'm not sure he is what Man United need at this time.\"",
      "De Ligt was left on the bench throughout the Euros, with manager Ronald Koeman favouring seasoned Inter Milan defender Stefan de Vrij alongside Virgil van Dijk at centre-back. Meanwhile, Souness will not be the only pundit who highlights that both Juventus and Bayern have been willing to part ways with De Ligt – but his career path has been a little more nuanced than that.",
      "Juventus, plagued by financial troubles that resulted in a ban from European competition last season, could not resist Bayern's reported £65million bid. As for Bayern, they signed Kim Min-jae from Napoli last year and could pocket £43million for their third-choice centre-back.",
      "Despite these factors, the centre-back feels he has something to prove at United. De Ligt's swift rise at Ajax naturally set high expectations. But he did not feature in some games for Bayern by the end, and the Netherlands international is perhaps not the player many anticipated he would become during his breakout season at Ajax.",
      "Souness believes United are right to be targeting another new centre-back, despite already bringing in Yoro. However, the 71-year-old is also concerned that De Ligt may not be well-suited to the physical demands of the Premier League.",
      "\"Jonny Evans played 23 times for Man United, they desperately need a centre-half,\" Souness said. \"I look at De Ligt, he's a lightweight centre-half.",
      "\"What you want from a centre-half first and foremost is to defend. It would appear that some coaches and managers think it’s all about playing out from the back. Keep the ball out the back of the net.”",

      "De Ligt, who was managed by Ten Hag at Ajax, became the Dutch club's youngest-ever captain and steered them to Eredivisie glory and a Champions League semi-final. The centre-back joined Juventus in 2019 but shortly before sealing his switch to Serie A, De Ligt was head-hunted by Ronaldo after that summer's Nations League final in an attempt to rubber-stamp his move to Turin.",
      "Upon completing his move to Italy, De Ligt said: \"After the final, I was already sure I wanted to join Juve. It was a big compliment to have Ronaldo ask me to join but it didn't make the difference.\"",

      "United legend Teddy Sheringham has slammed Sir Jim Ratcliffe claiming he doesn't see any \"ambition\" coming from the co-owner when it comes to transfers.",
      "It's been a busy summer for United with the club overseeing moves for Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna for £36.5million and Leny Yoro from Lille for £58.9million, while deals for Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt are rumoured to be imminent. However club icon Sheringham believes that the players brought in so far won't be sufficient enough to alter United's league fortunes.",
      "Sheringham, who was instrumental in United's iconic treble winning season in 1999, also claimed that Ratcliffe's hands-on approach with United \"doesn't mean anything\". The former striker didn't hold back as he also declared that there are no \"guarantees\" any of United's new recruits will turn out to be a good fit for Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "Speaking to onlinepoker.ltd, Sheringham unloaded on the new United hierarchy and insisted the new regime won't make much of a difference to the club's chances on the pitch. \"From my point of view, having a new football structure and Jim Ratcliffe involved as a minority owner doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t even touch the sides, and it won’t have any significant impact on what happens on the grass,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s just a new man putting money into the football club. Bringing in a new CEO and football executives won’t improve the players or the manager. I can’t see the new owners showing their ambition by bringing in a player that is going to have a transformative effect on the football club,\"",
      "United finally reached an agreement with Bayern Munich to sign Mazraoui and De Ligt at the weekend. The pair, who have a wealth of experience between them and are well known to Ten Hag from their Ajax days, will cost United around £51.5million, yet Sheringham doesn't believe the new regime are showing enough purpose in the market and took aim at the acquisitions of the inexperienced Zikzee, 23, and Yoro, 18.",
      "\"The business that United have concluded so far isn’t going to shift the needle. Yoro and Zirkzee are both young guys who will need time to adapt to the demands of Premier League football. There are no guarantees that they will be good signings - you don’t know what you will get from them,\" Sheringham said.",
      "With the big names rolling through the door this summer, United continue to be linked with even more players as Ten Hag looks to strengthen the side where he can ahead of the transfer window closing in just over a fortnight's time. However Sheringham has implored his old side to target players who can turn in big performances every week stating the club don't need any more \"inconsistencies\"",
      "\"They’re going to be inconsistent. Manchester United do not need any more inconsistencies, they need proper players that are going to give you an eight, nine or ten out of ten performance every week.\" he concluded.",

      "Wayne Rooney said that he was once sent to the \"back of the queue\" for penalties by Louis van Gaal.",
      "On a recent episode of The Stick to Football podcast, the Manchester United legend - alongside Ian Wright, Roy Keane, Gary Neville, and Jill Scott - spilt the beans on a peculiar rule the Dutchman implemented about spot kicks. He explained: \"For the forwards, if you're the penalty taker - if you miss - you're the back of the queue.",
      "\"Even in pre-season, if you miss a penalty, you go to number seven or eight in the queue.\" He then detailed how this policy affected him directly, adding: \"We got three penalties pre-season, I scored the first two. The last game before - we played Sevilla at Old Trafford - I've hit the post.",
      "\"So for the first game of the season, I was like number eight penalty taker.\" Adding to the comedy of the situation, Rooney revealed: \"Phil Jones went into the game as the penalty taker and you've got me and [Robin] Van Persie.\" Rooney's exceptional talent was evident from his early days.",
      "He exploded onto the football scene with Everton, making his senior debut at just 16 years old in a 2-2 draw against Spurs in August 2002. His remarkable journey into the annals of Premier League history began when he netted his first top-flight goal on October 19 - a mere five days shy of his 17th birthday - stunningly ending Arsenal's 30-game unbeaten streak with a last-minute winner.",
      "The goal made him the Premier League's youngest-ever goal scorer at the time, although this record has since been broken by James Milner and James Vaughan. Manchester United would acquire the star striker's services in 2004, with Rooney enjoying an outstanding thirteen-year stint at Old Trafford.",
      "During his time under Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Jose Mourinho, and van Gaal, Rooney lifted five Premier League trophies, three League Cups, an FA Cup, a Champions League and a Europa League - scoring 253 goals in 559 appearances across all competitions to cement himself as the Premier League's third top scorer of all time, behind Alan Shearer and Harry Kane.",
      "Rooney returned to Everton in the 2017/18 season, before seeing his playing days out at DC United and Derby County. He has since made the move to management and is currently in charge of Plymouth Argyle who are rock-bottom of the Championship table after a 4-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in their 2024/25 opener.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt are en route from Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich after Ineos agreed a combined fee worth £51.5million for their signatures. The former Ajax double act are set to follow Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to Old Trafford, and yet, further additions are still on radar.",
      "However, in the first instance, United will need to sanction player sales in order to generate much-needed funds, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka set to sign for West Ham for around £15million already. Here, we take a look at the latest news, views, and transfer rumours from other publications and provide our own insight on those updates.",
      "Football Insider and various other sources flag-up ongoing interest from United in Jarrad Branthwaite and argue United have seen another bid rejected by Everton. This one is thought to be in the region of £60million including add-ons, rather than cash in full for the England U21s regular.",
      "Branthwaite is still a genuine target for United this summer, despite De Ligt inbound and Yoro over the line. Two offers worth £43million and £50million were turned down by Everton for Branthwaite.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"As is so often the case, this all comes down to money. Nothing has changed in that United still want to sign Branthwaite this summer. However, further outlay (in all positions) is dependent on the club granting and finding exit routes for those on the transfer list, officially or unofficially.",
      "\"At the very least, Branthwaite will seemingly set United back £65million. They can't part with that sort of money right now after Yoro and Zirkzee plus Mazraoui and De Ligt cost them just shy of £150million all-told.\"",

It's said Calvert-Lewin is among a number of forwards Ineos have on their shopping list amid ongoing links to Ivan Toney, with both players heading into the final 12 months of their contracts.",
      "No would-be fee is mentioned in that update. It does, though, emphasise the need for outgoings.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"As much as Calvert-Lewin and Toney in particular would strengthen United - at least as cover and competition for Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee - another forward is way down the priority list at this stage.

      "The first question at Erik ten Hag's post-match debrief on Saturday did not centre on Harry Maguire but Ten Hag made it about Maguire.",

      "Within eight months, Ten Hag has gone from not needing Maguire to needing him. His specific admiration for Maguire's leadership was a tad rich when he had stripped him of the captaincy but this has been a season of contradictions from the Manchester United manager.",
      "Maguire has had a laudable campaign, especially considering his starting point. Impressionable fans in America and Ireland booed him during pre-season yet when Maguire limped off against Bayern Munich in December he was serenaded by the Old Trafford regulars.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures",
      "Andre Onana was playing to the gallery in Las Vegas when he let rip at Maguire during the defeat to Borussia Dortmund. At Bournemouth, Onana offered his teammate a high five during a tactical timeout.",
      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",

      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw.

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",

However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",

Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution.

In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "A penny for Luke Shaw's thoughts when right back Diogo Dalot had to switch to left back and right winger Facundo Pellistri emerged as an auxiliary right back.",
      "That was avoidable had Erik ten Hag selected an actual left back on the bench. Harry Amass, widely expected to start against Manchester City, was in the stands at Wembley.",
      "First game of the season and United were denied another attraction for their museum by a depleted defence. Five of the six injuries they have recorded in 2024-25 have been to defenders.",
      "United are mum on the extent of Shaw's issue. Ten Hag said he was a \"question mark\" on Thursday. There are several questions.",
      "Shaw has not played for United since he hobbled off shortly before half-time at Luton on February 18. He has since played 177 minutes for England at the European Championship, where Shaw completed three halves within 96 hours.",
      "After the final in Berlin, Shaw took the full three weeks off he is entitled to between seasons. Some United fans would have disapproved of that after he missed the final three months of last season.",
      "It is a fine balancing act. Cut short a brittle player's recovery time or allow him ample rest after mentally and physically challenging weeks with England at a major tournament.",
      "United opted for the latter. It would have been vindicated had Shaw not missed the first game of the new season but he did.",
      "It is worse than that. Shaw has not been pictured in training since last Monday, the day he returned to Carrington. United's touring players had Monday and Tuesday off, so the full first-team training sessions were on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Shaw did not participate in any of them.",
      "Shaw candidly acknowledged he, Ten Hag and the United medical staff were blameworthy for his hamstring injury in February. He started at Luton a week after he was substituted at half-time at Aston Villa.",
      "Unless there is some freakish context that is yet to emerge, on this occasion the responsibility is solely Shaw's. He has played in 275 out of a possible 561 United games in the past ten years. 27.5 appearances per season is not what you would expect from a first-teamer.",
      "Shaw, of course, recovered from a horrific injury in Eindhoven in 2015. He belatedly won over Jose Mourinho and there has been fleeting competition from Brandon Williams, Alex Telles and Tyrell Malacia. Yet he has pretty much had a clear run at left back for ten years.",
      "Two of his United managers publicly criticised his fitness. Louis van Gaal did as far back as July 2014. Here Shaw is, entering his 11th season with United, with his fitness under more scrutiny. Just like that season, he has started it sidelined through injury.",
      "During the 2019 tour, a teammate filmed Shaw being outsprinted by the fitness coach Charlie Owen at the WACA in Perth. In a camp where Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was determined to make United fitter than ever, Shaw, recovering from a minor injury, was lagging behind. He pulled his hamstring three games into the season and was out for three months.",
      "Shaw's conditioning has to change. It is not rotten luck that Shaw has succumbed to another injury in his first week back. United are sometimes nebulous on the extent of injuries but the strength of their squad in the Community Shield and the personnel in training would indicate Shaw is injured again.",
      "The succession planning at left back has to start now. Shaw signed a new contract until 2028 last year and it has to be his last. He cannot be trusted and neither can Tyrell Malacia. His return from knee surgery is now scheduled to be nearly 17 months after his last appearance for United.",
      "Ten Hag said less than two weeks ago Amass required three more months to get to the level of a first-team squad member. That accounted for his omission at the weekend.",
      "\"I think we had some seniority there,\" Ten Hag said. \"To start, I think that was the idea. We had a plan how to deal with it and I think also that went how we thought.",
      "\"I think all the full backs, although not all were full backs, like Licha (Martinez), he did good as a full back. Diogo (Dalot) is the full back and Facundo (Pellistri) did well as the full back. We are pleased with those performances.\"",
      "Pellistri did not. It was through no fault of his own that Bernardo Silva ghosted past him. Pellistri should not have been in that situation. It was not the first time in pre-season that a younger player was hung out and left to dry by a senior teammate.",
      "Shaw uploaded a paranoid post onto his Instagram page after the FA Cup final, stressing, \"I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United.\"",
      "A failing of United's squad management in recent times has been to recruit players more invested in their country than their club. Shaw had a raging hangover after an exceptional Euro 2020 and supporters on the trains down from Manchester on Saturday spoke about him witheringly.",
      "He has had two truly good seasons out of ten with United (2020-21 and 2022-23) and the first was during the fake football of the Covid era. Shaw accepted the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year statue for the 2018-19 season when United had their worst defensive record in the top flight for 40 years.",
      "\"You could've picked anyone out of a hat,\" Shaw sheepishly said at his recognition. Ten Hag is still having to do that with the United defence.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Manchester United are close to completing deals to sign Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich.",
      "De Ligt and Mazraoui were spotted dining in Manchester hot spot Sexy Fish in Spinningfields on Monday night and United are expected to announce the deals imminently.",
      "United needed to strengthen their backline after the departure of Raphael Varane and De Ligt arrives with European pedigree after playing for Bayern, Juventus and Ajax.",
      "Mazraoui is being signed due to concerns about the full-back position at United. The Morocco international is versatile and can play on both sides of the defence, which makes him an attractive option amid continued doubts over the fitness of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Shaw last played for United against Luton Town on February 18 when he sustained a muscle injury that ruled him out for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "The 29-year-old was still included in the England squad for Euro 2024 and made his first appearance at the tournament at the quarter-final stage. However, Shaw wasn't fit enough to make the United squad against Manchester City in the Community Shield last weekend.",
      "United fans have grown tired of Shaw's injury struggles and a few supporters on the train down to London on Saturday were overheard saying he must be replaced.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in June 2023 and Erik ten Hag recently confirmed he should return from his lengthy lay-off due to a knee problem in October.",
      "Mazraoui will provide Shaw with competition for his starting role at left-back, providing he's fit, and can start at right-back if Diogo Dalot is given a rest in cup competitions.",
      "The signings of the Bayern Munich pair for a combined fee of £51.5millions represent sensible business and they are expected to make the squad for the opening game of the campaign.",
      "United have the privilege of playing the first game of the 2024/25 Premier League season and will welcome Fulham to Old Trafford on Friday night. The squad will look different to the final league fixture of last season but unfortunately, new signing Leny Yoro won't be involved.",
      "Yoro fractured his metatarsal in his second appearance of pre-season this summer and he's been ruled out for three months after successful surgery on his foot injury.",
      "The defender has vast potential and it's a shame his impact will be delayed, but his return is something to look forward to and hopefully he will hit the ground running when he recovers.",
      "There are 17 days left of the summer window and United are considering their midfield options, with another move for Sofyan Amrabat understood to have not been ruled out.",
      "United were admirers of Martin Zubimendi but Liverpool were in pole position to sign the Spaniard before he decided to perform a U-turn and remain at Real Sociedad, while Burnley midfielder Sander Berge is another option under consideration ahead of the transfer deadline.",
      "Regardless of whether a midfielder is signed or not, a handful of senior players will miss out on the 20-man matchday squad in the Premier League when everyone is fit and available.",
      "Yoro isn't expected to return until October and Rasmus Hojlund is sidelined with a hamstring injury, but it's fascinating to look at what the squad could look like at full strength.",
      "Below is an example of what the United squad might look like if Ten Hag has every United player at his disposal. That rarely happens and injuries are inevitable during a season, but it would mean tough decisions and senior players being left out of the squad on a matchday.",
      "Goalkeepers: Onana, Bayindir.",
      "Defenders: Maguire, Martinez, Yoro, De Ligt, Dalot, Shaw, Mazraoui.",
      "Midfielders: Mount, Fernandes, Casemiro, Mainoo, McTominay.",
      "Attackers: Hojlund, Rashford, Zirkzee, Amad, Garnacho, Antony.",
      "The players missing from that list include Malacia, Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, Jadon Sancho, Christian Eriksen, Tom Heaton and Facundo Pellistri. Lindelof and Pellistri could be sold before the transfer deadline but the other five players are expected to stay at United.",
      "If everyone is fit, Ten Hag will be forced to have difficult conversations and opportunities for youngsters like Harry Amass, Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley could be limited.",
      "However, the reality is United will contend with different injury concerns this season and the entire squad will be relied upon, which means fewer difficult conversations with players.",
      "United have a strong squad when every player is fit - how often that will happen remains to be seen.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "Manchester United could soon sanction a double transfer that Erik ten Hag will love.",
      "The Reds have already signed Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro, with arrivals for Bayern Munich duo Matthijs De Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui to be confirmed imminently after West Ham announced the addition of Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Though that will be four players through the door at Old Trafford and nearly £150million spent, United are not done there.",
      "A priority ahead of the summer window beginning was to sign a new forward, defender, and midfielder, with the latter still needing to be completed. Joao Neves was a target in the early weeks of June, though he has since joined Paris Saint-Germain from Benfica.",
      "Since then Sander Berge, Youssouf Fofana and Martin Zubimendi have all been linked, though reports stated Manuel Ugarte was no longer being considered because of his steep asking price. A return for Sofyan Amrabat is also under consideration, but Ugarte certainly appears to be the best addition for a number of reasons, with talks now back on.",
      "Firstly, following their decision to sign Neves for a fee in the region of £50.6million (€60m), Ugarte looks to have the green light to seal an exit just 12 months on from joining. The French giants could also be open to selling at a lower price and potentially even sanction a season-long loan that could suit United. Though if that scenario does not play out, United have an extra incentive to sign the Uruguay international on a permanent deal.",
      "According to French outlet L'Equipe, talks are ongoing between the two clubs, with PSG interested in Jadon Sancho, who could still leave despite fixing his relationship with Ten Hag, and United keen to reignite their pursuit of Ugarte. As there is an open line of communication between both parties, United should find it much easier to resume negotiations for Ugarte with Sancho heading the other way.",
      "Premier League rivals Chelsea did something very similar earlier in the window during talks with Atletico Madrid. When talks were opened for Conor Gallagher to join Atletico Madrid, the Blues then decided to go back in for Samu Omorodion with a cut-price deal worth £35m agreed.",
      "Though neither transfer has yet been confirmed, with Omorodion's move collapsing at the final hurdle and Gallagher's £33million switch in limbo, United could take inspiration from how Chelsea were able to green light two transfers during one round of talks.",
      "Both deals currently being off, though, will be the only thing that United do not want repeating as they attempt to sanction a double transfer.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "It has been revealed whether or not Manchester United are pursuing the signing of Mario Hermoso. The 29-year-old defender has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer as Erik ten Hag looks to further bolster his backline.",
      "Hermoso, who became a free agent following the expiration of his contract with Atletico Madrid in June, featured 31 times in La Liga last season, keeping 10 clean sheets. Playing a key role in Diego Simeone's side, he helped Los Colchoneros finish fourth and secure Champions League qualification.",
      "After five years at the Cívitas Metropolitano, the Spain international opted against signed a new deal. With the player yet to find a new club and Leny Yoro sidelined due to injury, Hermoso has emerged as a shrewd opportunity in the market.",
      "In fact, according to The Athletic, club executives met the Spaniard in Madrid last week. The report states that Hermoso has been holding talks with prospective new clubs ahead of the new season.",
      "However, despite entertaining discussions, The Athletic add that United are not pursuing the centre-half, although they are exploring their options. While the summer transfer window doesn't slam shut until the end of August, the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign is just around the corner.",
      "Last week, Ten Hag called for patience on new signings. Speaking to reporters ahead of the Red Devils' clash against Manchester City in the Community Shield, the Dutchman claimed that his squad is in a 'good position'.",
      "\"When we have news, we will announce it,\" insisted Ten Hag. \"You see the market is quite quiet still but we have done our business, we have done two deals. It is about timings and it is about the market options and [ensuring] in the right moment we do the right things.\"",
      "When quizzed on the arrival of a new central midfielder, he added: 'I don't go into details where we are now with recruitment and what we are working on.",
      "\"We know what we are doing and I think we are in a good position with the squad. For you, just wait, be patient and in the right moment, we will tell you.\"",
      "United have been heavily linked with numerous players this summer, but none more so than Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui. The Bayern Munich duo face increasingly uncertain futures at the Allianz Arena, with Ten Hag eager to strengthen his defence.",

      "Anthony Martial's failure to lock down a fixed position at Manchester United could be why Erik ten Hag got rid of him.",
      "The Frenchman spent nine years at Old Trafford, racking up more than 300 appearances and scoring 90 goals. He was let go at the end of last season following the expiration of his contract and is currently without a club.",
      "The 28-year-old never really cemented a regular spot in United's first team and was used in a variety of positions including on the wing and in the No. 9 role. Back in 2020, Bruno Fernandes joked about Martial's positional limbo - something which, in hindsight, potentially explains the motivation behind his eventual departure.",
      "\"With Marcus [Rashford], there is always that kind of joke with him and Anto [Anthony Martial],\" Fernandes told United's website. \"I say to them every time I pass to them, they never score.",
      "\"They never give me assists. You see again that Anto missed that chance against Leeds. Straight away, I looked at him and started smiling. He understands what I mean by that.\"",
      "Fernandes insisted the mickey-taking dynamic was \"positive\", and that trying to prove their team-mates wrong helped motivate the players. But it nonetheless suggests why United were more than happy to let Martial go, with the former Monaco man struggling to make waves both as a winger and a centre-forward.",
      "The French star made 19 appearances in all competitions under Ten Hag last season, scoring just twice. His season was cut short by groin surgery in February, but prior to that he was primarily used as a substitute.",
      "There were, however, moments when it seemed as if Martial, who infamously joined with a Ballon d'Or-winning clause in his contract, might have what it takes to lead the Red Devils' line. During the 2019/20 season, he registered 17 league goals - including a hattrick against Sheffield United - and added a further six in other competitions.",
      "This was under former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but since Ten Hag joined in 2022, Martial has been relegated to a bit-part role. Rasmus Hojlund's arrival in 2023 pushed him further down the pecking order, and he ended up starting just five league games last season.",

      "If anybody in Manchester United's squad will be determined to prove his doubters wrong this season, it is Casemiro.",
      "After an excellent debut season at Old Trafford in 2022/23, the Brazilian regressed at an alarming rate last season. He was criticised relentlessly, so much so that suggestions of retirement were mooted.",
      "Turning 33 next February, it would be in United's best interests to try and offload him before the end of this summer's transfer window. But with another two years remaining on his deal, they are unlikely to receive offers in the region they are looking for.",
      "Though United must bring in a new holding midfielder before the window closes in a little over a fortnight's time, the dream scenario would be for Casemiro to defy his critics and get back to his very best.",
      "He has started each of the Reds' six games in preparation for Friday night's Premier League opener against Fulham, meaning he is a shoo-in to start for the visit of the Cottagers. He captained the side throughout pre-season and even helped himself to a goal in the 3-2 win over Real Betis at the Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego.",
      "Despite being drafted in from Real Madrid two years ago to add steel and grit to United's midfield - something which he did excellently in his first season at the club - he has often been reliable in an attacking sense. He has 12 goals and nine assists in 84 competitive appearances for the club.",
      "Although he is a player of a defensive profile, he is often hungry to get forward and pop up in advanced positions. He linked up superbly with Amad on the edge of the penalty area in Saturday's Community Shield clash with Manchester City, playing a key hand in what very nearly led to United scoring the game's opening goal in the first half.",
      "He often ventured forward in pre-season, too, giving United an extra body when they attempted to attack the opposition's penalty area. As a caveat, it must be highlighted pre-season friendlies are not played at full throttle, but you can only make a judgement on what you see in front of you.",
      "In Casemiro's case, he deserves credit where credit's due for his performances over the last four weeks. However, he has looked better going forwards than he has at attempting to protect the back-four.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",

      "He was clumsy in gift-wrapping Liverpool their opening goal in their 3-0 win over United in South Carolina just over a week ago, and he was sloppy with the ball against Arsenal in Los Angeles seven days earlier. With that said, there is still an obvious need for a new holding midfielder, who can get around the pitch that little bit quicker to protect the back-four.",
      "As a counter-argument, however, Casemiro's defensive statistics from Saturday's clash with City at Wembley made encouraging reading; he produced seven tackles - the most of anyone on the pitch - and two clearances. In the other direction, he successfully produced two key passes - only City bright spark Oscar Bobb produced more (three).",
      "His performance at Wembley was encouraging, but still more so in an attacking sense. His years of experience and knowledge still make him a key player and it would be a big shock to see him miss out on a starting berth against Fulham.",
      "\"He has a pre-season so he is very fit in this moment,\" Ten Hag said of Casemiro after the defeat to City on penalties. \"I think, as a team, we work good together and I think that makes it for Case (Casemiro) very easy.",
      "\"Then he can bring his skills in and then you can see his importance for the game and for our team.\"",
      "With the mission to bring in a defensive midfielder proving complex and highly likely to go down to the dying stages of the window, Casemiro will still be tasked with protecting the back-four for now. It is not the ideal situation, such is the way he declined when tasked with that responsibility last season, but if United can retain possession a little better than they did last term, the Brazilian could be useful in attacking situations.",
      "Of course, Casemiro's main purpose is to defend and keep things ticking in midfield, but his attacking contributions can often go under the radar. His forward actions have been noticed in recent weeks and United would love him to take those into the season opener.",

      "There are some players in the United dressing room - and at every other Premier League club - who choose to blank journalists as they walk through the mixed zone, which is obviously their prerogative, but having the decency to politely say 'not today' is always appreciated.",
      "Journalists don't look for sympathy when they are ignored in the mixed zone - it's part of the job and that's not what this article is about - but politely declining goes a long way.",

      "Casemiro briefly exchanged a few words of Spanish with a journalist and Erik ten Hag, who had conducted his press conference, walked through next. The Dutchman gave a nod to reporters and had a warm embrace with City defender Nathan Ake, who left at the same time.",
      "Ten Hag was generous with his time before the pre-season tour of the United States and exclusively spoke to Manchester-based reporters after facing Rosenborg and Rangers, which was appreciated.",
      "When the majority of the United squad have walked through the mixed zone and none have stopped to speak, a reporter's hopes of engaging with a player for quotes are dampened.",
      "However, before leaving the mixed zone and abandoning the pursuit, the natural thing to do is to think about which players have departed already and who might be remaining in the dressing room.",
      "On Saturday, one of the last players to walk through was Bruno Fernandes and he said: \"Sorry, I've spoken to everybody else [two other broadcasters] already,\" with a sympathetic look on his face.",
      "Fernandes is regarded as the best talker at United by Manchester-based journalists, who see him up close every week, and it was typical of his character not to blank a request to chat.",
      "Many in the national media questioned why Fernandes was given the captain's armband last summer but nobody who closely follows United echoed those sentiments because he was the only choice to succeed Maguire.",
      "Fernandes embodies what being a United player means. He has given his best years to the club during an up-and-down period and deserves the new contract he's set to sign.",
      "\"I will be here until I've said, the club needs to want me,\" said Fernandes about his future after the final home game of last season. \"I feel the club wants me to be part of the future, so as I said, I don't want to be a player the club doesn't want to have. I will go if for some reason they don't want me.\"",
      "Safeguarding Fernandes' future was always going to be the best piece of business United could do this year and the 28-year-old will be rewarded with higher wages in his new deal.",
      "Although Sir Jim Ratcliffe is attempting to lower the wage bill, an exception must be made for the club captain, who has been worth his weight in gold over the last few seasons.",
      "Fernandes has been outstanding on the pitch and has been a terrific ambassador away from it, which was highlighted again after the FA Cup final when a story emerged claiming he offered to pay for a staff trip to Wembley out of his own pocket following Ratcliffe's cost-saving cuts.",
      "There is a misconception about Fernandes' personality in the national media due to his occasional petulance with referees during matches but that shouldn't detract from who he truly is.",

      "Manchester United's pre-season came to an end in disappointing fashion on Saturday as Manchester City beat them 7-6 on penalties to win the Community Shield.",
      "While the defeat is unlikely to haunt the United fans nor Erik ten Hag for too long, there were still things the Reds' backroom staff will have learned from the narrow defeat. The most poignant being how valuable Lisandro Martinez is to the team's defence.",
      "With defenders dropping like flies in the build-up to the clash at Wembley Stadium, Ten Hag was able to call upon Martinez at left-back to allow Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans the luxury of playing in more familiar positions. Such versatility could prove crucial for the Reds this season particularly when the likes of Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw are still trying to overcome their injury problems.",
      "It is not surprising that United struggled to settle defensively last season without Martinez being in the starting line-up on a consistent basis. With Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro joining this summer, it would be easy to cast the Argentine to one side as just another player but this weekend he proved how integral he remains for the Reds.",
      "If United are going to be successful this season it shall also be dependent on the fitness of Bruno Fernandes. Playing in the unfamiliar false nine position, the Portuguese was once again one of the standout players for United.",
      "With every passing performance, you can see how the captaincy at Old Trafford has aided Fernandes. Before, the 29-year-old would get too caught up in shenanigans which made him an easy target but that side of his game appears to be simmering down now as the weight of the armband shows its positive impact.",
      "His performance at Wembley was a fine example of this but also begs the bigger question of why Fernandes was not named among the 'untouchable' players at Old Trafford at the beginning of the transfer window. However, the new contract on the table for Fernandes should put any concerns to bed about his future.",
      "The final big talking point from the traditional pre-season opener revolved around Marcus Rashford. The academy product promised he would come back stronger than ever after missing out on the England Euro 2024 squad and suffering a poor season by his standards.",
      "Rashford will wish he had gotten off to the perfect start when he mistimed his strike after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho.

      "After a turbulent start to the summer, the real business is finally about to begin as Manchester United prepare to get their Premier League campaign underway - but have they done enough to improve on last season's disappointment?",
      "Erik ten Hag's first task of the summer was to keep his job after a period of uncertainty surrounding the Dutchman's position. Instead Ten Hag extended his contract, and will now lead his team out with renewed confidence on Friday night as United start the season with a much-needed blank canvas.",
      "Fulham are first up at Old Trafford, with the Cottagers hoping to repeat their exploits from last season which saw them leave Manchester with all three points following a 2-1 win.",
      "Now, we're asking you for your views on the upcoming season. Have the Red Devils done enough in the transfer window to improve on last season's dismal eighth-placed finish? Are you confident Ten Hag can guide his men to a Champions League place?",
      "United have added two new faces to their ranks this summer in Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee, though the former will miss the opening fixtures after undergoing surgery on a foot injury picked up in pre-season.",
      "There's hope that two more names will be added to the list of incomings soon though. Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui have both undergone medicals ahead of their £51.5m double move from Bayern Munich, and could even be registered in time to face Fulham this week.",

The Manchester United legend lasted just 83 days at St Andrews' before being sacked in January where he left Birmingham in the Championship bottom three, having been in the playoffs when he arrived.",
      "Blues never recovered from their Rooney experiment and were relegated on the final day of the 2023/24 season, their first relegation from English football's top two tiers in 30 years. Rooney understandably took a break from management before news emerged that Plymouth Argyle had appointed him this summer.",
      "And with all eyes on the touchline to see how the 38-year-old would fare in his second job in the Championship, he could not have got off to a worse start. The Pilgrims were smashed 4-0 against Sheffield Wednesday in their opening fixture of the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "It was just what Rooney didn't need after his struggles at Birmingham and with so many critics waiting to pounce on any sign of failure in the early stages of his new job. It is why Rooney's comments back in February about managing Man United one day now look to be in tatters already.",
      "\"Managing Manchester United or Everton is the aim, these big jobs are where you want to get to,\" he said on Match of the Day, when working as an analyst for United's FA Cup game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "\"But it's a process. I have got to go through the steps and get myself back on track. I want to get myself back into management to make sure in the next 10 years I'm hopefully in a position to go into one of the big jobs.\"",
      "No one can deny that Rooney has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to playing at the highest level. That experience will no doubt have influenced his employees and most United fans will want him to succeed.",
      "Rooney's punditry work for the BBC during Euro 2024 and his time on the Overlap podcast with Gary Neville have shown him to be a likeable character who has more charisma than some will have had you believe.",

      "United kick off their Premier League campaign in four day's time against Fulham where both new signings may need to be used. Ten Hag confirmed after the Community Shield that Harry Maguire has a knock whilst Lisandro Martinez started Saturday's game in his unnatural left-back position, with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia unavailable.",
      "But another immediate concern has emerged which United may need to address before facing the Cottagers on Friday. Both of United's potential new signings have seen very little match action in pre-season.",
      "De Ligt has not played a single minute since returning from his post-Euro 2024 summer break. The Dutchman did not feature at all during the tournament in Germany with his last minutes coming in an international friendly against Canada on June 6.",
      "Mazraoui meanwhile has played 24 minutes from the bench in a friendly against Duren on July 24 and 22 minutes against Tottenham on August 3. It means that both players will be some way off match fitness and may not have much time to adapt to the intensity of Premier League football.",
      "One solution could be handing the pair minutes in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The game would need to take place sooner rather than later though with time running out before Friday's game.",
      "If both players can get through their opening fixture unscathed, they will have another week to get towards full fitness before taking on Brighton. It's hard to see how either player will play the full 90 minutes against Fulham, but Ten Hag may be able to give them enough minutes to ease them in.",
      "But United cannot afford to start the season badly and playing two players in positions which could leave them exposed will be a risk. If they can mitigate that risk then a problem area of the pitch will be strengthened significantly.",

Confirmation on that £51.5million double agreement could even come before United get their Premier League campaign underway.",
      "Such is the modern way, attention has already turned to what or whom might be next. Ineos will need to sanction further sales to get more proposed signings over the line - but there are still a few bargain options waiting for their co-ownership group to consider in positions that have been pinpointed.",
      "United are still in the market for another left-back, centre-back and central midfielder to give Ten Hag cover and competition in his engine room. Here, we take a closer look at three free agents in those areas.",
      "United were heavily linked with a swoop for Marcos Alonso last summer, before signing Sergio Reguilon on loan, and Ineos remain 'open' to bringing in another left-back before August 30. It comes amid lingering question marks over Ten Hag's first signing Tyrell Malacia, who will not feature until October at the earliest.",
      "By that stage, it will have been 17 months since he made a senior appearance. In his twilight years - at 33 - former Chelsea favourite Alonso is already well-versed in the unique rigours of the Premier League.",
      "Another man that has done the rounds before. Mario Hermoso is not, as things stand, a genuine target for United this summer, but the club are similarly 'open' to signing another centre-back.",
      "Everton starlet Jarrad Branthwaite is their prime choice, despite Everton playing hard-ball over their valuation and United needing to organise more big-money sales. However, should the clock tick past 11pm on August 30 without further movement, the ex-Atletico Madrid defender will become a viable option.",
      "Here we go again, you might argue. Despite being dead-batted by Adrien Rabiot before, the former Juventus man was included on a four-strong shopping list by United in their ongoing search for another midfielder - although the club are looking at more fanciful alternatives in that role.",

      "Ugarte, who sees his contract at Les Parc des Princes expire in June 2028, featured 25 times for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 last season, providing three assists. Despite playing a key role in a title-winning domestic campaign, he struggled to force himself into Luis Enrique's side in the Champions League.",
      "Once the Parisians had qualified for the knockout stages, the Uruguay international was sidelined. Nevertheless, after just 12 months in the French capital, Ugarte faces an uncertain future – and the Red Devils have emerged as potential suitors.",
      "So much so that, according to L’Equipe journalist Loïc Tanzi, the United target has been banished from training, along with Nordi Mukiele and Danilo. The report states that the three could leave PSG before the transfer window slams shut at the end of this month.",
      "According to the Mirror earlier this month, the Red Devils believe the French giants' asking price is too high and they will only re-enter negotiations if their demands are lowered. The report claims that PSG are eager to recoup the £51.4million they paid Sporting CP for Ugarte last summer.",
      "Last week, Ten Hag called for patience on new signings. Speaking to reporters ahead of the Red Devils' clash against Manchester City in the Community Shield, the Dutchman claimed that his squad is in a 'good position'.",
      "\"When we have news, we will announce it,\" insisted Ten Hag. \"You see the market is quite quiet still but we have done our business, we have done two deals. It is about timings and it is about the market options and [ensuring] in the right moment we do the right things.\"",

However, while clubs across Europe will be keeping a watchful eye on what unfolds for Gallagher over these next 24 hours or so, Ineos are best served ignoring their opportunity to hijack a move.",
      "It seemed for all the world Gallagher would relocate to Spain this summer. Chelsea and Atletico Madrid agreed a £33.7million fee, but with the 24-year-old preparing to jet back to London, there are lingering question marks over that proposed transfer as key figures involved weigh up possible solutions.",
      "The Gallagher deal has stalled following a completed £81.5million move for now-former Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez, while Chelsea have had Samu Omorodion and Joao Felix in their crosshairs in a triangle-like transfer saga featuring City and Atletico; one nothing to do with United despite their ongoing search for a midfielder.",
      "Gallagher, as he underlined at Euro 2024 this summer, is a decent player in his own right. However, the ideal plan for United to strengthen their engine room is by finding direct cover and competition for Casemiro; they need an option who is first and foremost a tackler capable of operating as a one-man shield.",
      "That's the best way for them to unleash Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes when Casemiro is absent. Academy graduate Mainoo is more than able to sit deepest in a midfield three, but that detracts from his main qualities and for United to have a successful season, they really do need their superstar teenager purring.",
      "Not to put an undue pressure on him, mind. Mainoo must be allowed to nurture at his own pace, which has been nothing short of meteoric to this stage, but he would benefit most of all without Casemiro by having someone of similar ilk alongside him - with Fernandes operating at No.10.",
      "Mason Mount could eventually justify his £60million transfer fee and come good in his iconic No.7 shirt. However, when rubber-stamping his own move from Stamford Bridge last summer, that deal was an oversight for United as they did not particularly need to sign an attack-minded option at that juncture.",
      "Mount was brought in to replace Christian Eriksen alongside Casemiro, before Mainoo assumed that mantle, with Gallagher's former teammate Mount often faring much better as a No.10 or wide attacker. United made an error in signing Mount for their intended purpose and they mustn't do the same with Gallagher.",
      "In limbo, Gallagher will represent a relative bargain for someone, at £33.7million, after Chelsea opted to cash-in to ease PSR concerns and generate 'pure profit' for their own recruitment drive. United, though, simply have to plead ignorance to the chance that has inadvertently been presented to them.",

      "The ongoing recruitment drive at Old Trafford kicked into gear shortly before Manchester United were beaten in the Community Shield by neighbours Manchester City on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United pushed City all the way, before penalties were needed to separate them. However, the big news beneath the famous arch was not, necessarily, what happened on the pitch or from 12 yards.",
      "In the build-up to that match, it was confirmed United had (finally) reached an agreement with Bayern Munich to sign Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui for £51.5million combined. The incoming duo - who are well known to United manager Erik ten Hag from their Ajax days - are due to follow Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to Old Trafford and take their overall spend close to the £150million-mark.",
      "Before deals for De Ligt and Mazraoui were struck up, The Manchester Evening News understood United wanted to make at least three more major signings this summer. Getting more over the line will be shaped by player sales.",
      "That means United might just have one final trick up their sleeve, in any case. Here, our reporters debate what the next should be for Dan Ashworth, Ineos and key figures behind the scenes;",
      "With De Ligt and Mazraoui poised to be the next arrivals through the door at Old Trafford, attention now simply has to switch to strengthening the midfield. United have significantly strengthened their defence and added a new attacker to their ranks, meaning the midfield is the only department that has remained untouched.",
      "As anticipated, it is proving to be the hardest transfer mission they wanted to solve this summer. They have been linked with a plethora of midfielders in recent weeks, but nothing has yet come to fruition.",
      "Doubts have been cast about Casemiro's capacity to continue as United's chief holding midfielder, meaning they must strengthen that area of the squad before the window shuts. Manuel Ugarte is the best solution to solve that issue, but Paris Saint-Germain are not budging on their valuation of the player.",
      "United need a defensive specialist to compliment the qualities of Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in midfield. However, true defensive specialists are not as common as they used to be, meaning links with Youssouf Fofana and Sander Berge are understandable.",
      "However, by hook or by crook, United have got to find a midfielder from somewhere.",
      "United may not feel the need to sign any more players following confirmation of arrivals for De Ligt and Mazraoui. With four new summer signings now through the door at Old Trafford, Ten Hag and Ineos have completed many of their transfer aims, but more players could still yet join.",
      "A new forward and central defender have been acquired but a midfielder is still desperately needed, especially if Scott McTominay also seals an exit. Casemiro, despite links to Saudi Arabia, looks set to stay at the club but Ten Hag is still light in that department.",
      "Berge, Fofana and Martin Zubimendi have all been linked but if I were Sir Jim Ratcliffe or Ashworth, Ugarte would be the priority. Though PSG do not look set to lower his asking price, it is a deal still worth pursuing as the Uruguay international has the ability to fit perfectly into United's midfield.",
      "Casemiro and Mainoo are of a very different profile to Ugarte and thus he can provide Ten Hag with something he does not currently have in his squad.",
      "Following the arrivals of defensive duo De Ligt and Mazraoui, United only really need to strengthen one area of the pitch - providing there are no other injuries or long absentees - before the end of the summer transfer window. And that position is in central midfield.",
      "United have been linked with a number of players, including Ugarte, Fofana and Zubimendi, but if I were Sir Jim or Ten Hag, I would look at Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton. I have been saying all summer that United should pursue a move for the 19-year-old midfielder if they have the funds - and my stance on him has not changed. Wharton, for me, would be the perfect fit in that midfield.",
      "If United cannot get Wharton, then Berge should be the alternative. The Norwegian has an abundance of Premier League experience and was one of Burnley's standout performers last season.",
      "It's been a promising transfer window for United so far but there remains one area of the pitch which needs fixing. Casemiro played well in midfield against City but signing a younger and more athletic version of the Brazilian could be United's most important summer deal.",
      "Ending interest in Ugarte was a blow but I understand the decision with the fees being reported for him. If they can get his asking price down then I think it would be a deal worth returning to.",
      "If signing Ugarte is truly dead in the water then why not try to sign Zubimendi, if unlike Liverpool they can convince him to leave Real Sociedad. Burnley's Berge would be another alternative, although I'm much less convinced with that one as it's a big step up for him.",
      "Central midfield should be United's top priority now they have added reinforcements to their defence. Berge continues to be linked with the Reds but I am not convinced he is the right man for the job.",
      "Casemiro played well in the Community Shield but the proof will be in his performance come the Premier League's start date. Ugarte continues to be a player of interest for the Reds and perhaps he would be a good option but they will need PSG to lower their price tag somewhat before signing off on that deal.",
      "AS Monaco's Fofana may also be a good option for United but what's definitively clear is that Ten Hag must add a midfielder to his squad before the season comes to an end.",
      "One area of the United squad is screaming out for an addition before the end of the transfer window for me, and that is in central midfield. The signings of Yoro and De Ligt means that defence has been strengthened (despite Yoro's current injury), while the arrival of Zirkzee addresses the striker position.",
      "Ten Hag now needs to look at who will play alongside Mainoo in midfield. United have been linked with several players in the position, including Ugarte and Berge.",
      "Wharton of Crystal Palace is a good shout, but is likely to come with a big price tag, especially with Palace looking likely to lose Marc Guehi as well as Michael Olise.",
      "The club decided not trigger an option in Sofyan Amrabat's loan deal this summer, but they could yet negotiate a lower price with Fiorentina. The player is said to be keen on the move back to Old Trafford, and if they can get a significant reduction, then it may be a wise move to bring him back as a shorter-term option.",
      "Patience may mean a move for Wharton sometime in the future may be possible.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window spending is set to take the next step up this week as Bayern Munich duo Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui prepare to join for a combined fee of £51.5m.",
      "These deals signify United manager Erik ten Hag going to the old and familiar well of players he has worked with previously. Both men enjoyed brilliant spells under the Dutchman's coaching at Ajax.",
      "The duo improved tremendously in Amsterdam during his reign with De Ligt particularly moving on to bigger and better things since. However, the pair have been left out in the cold at the Allianz Arena and now they are both seeking shelter with United.",
      "As with all new arrivals to the club, there is bound to be a significant impact on the current playing squad. In this instance, there are five players who are set to be seriously affected by the two new recruits.",
      "First up, is Aaron Wan-Bissaka. MEN Sport understands United's pursuit of De Ligt and Mazraoui was delayed while they waited for an agreement to be reached for the Englishman's exit.",
      "The expectation is that West Ham United will snap up Wan-Bissaka with his medical currently being conducted in London as we speak. With that deal almost home and hosed, the next player to be impacted is Victor Lindelof.",
      "United's Swede has been a valued member of the squad under several managers but there is a general acceptance that he does not have what it takes to take United back to the top of the domestic and European game. MEN Sport understands the Reds are actively pursuing a sale for Lindelof this summer and reports on Monday suggested his future is being discussed at a transfer meeting today.",
      "While the first two United players are looking at the permanent exit door, the other three are looking at their playing time being altered one way or another. Tyrell Malacia suffered a horrendous injury last summer which kept him sidelined for the entirety of 2023/24.",
      "The Dutchman has yet to return to the pitch but it is unlikely that he will be able to play regularly for United while he is recovering. With Mazraoui in the building, Malacia could be sent out on loan to regain his fitness away from the club which would surely be desired by all parties.",
      "Malacia's left-back teammate Luke Shaw has a big season ahead of him after suffering with his own fair share of injuries in 2023/24. If fit, he is still the Reds' best left-back but he will be aware that his standards cannot slip if he is to stay there and this, unfortunately, includes ensuring his fitness remains knowing full well Mazraoui can do a job on that left-side.",
      "Finally, Harry Maguire's role at United is most likely to alter with De Ligt's signature. Ten Hag is likely to preference a starting centre-back partnership of Martinez and De Ligt while Leny Yoro is out injured.",
      "Once the Frenchman returns, Yoro is likely to move above Maguire in the pecking order with the England international having to settle for being back-up. With his contract expiring in 2025, it will be interesting to see whether the former Leicester City man is happy to once again wait for his chance in the starting XI.",

Their signings have been facilitated thanks to an agreement being reached with West Ham for Aaron Wan-Bissaka's departure.",
      "While De Ligt and Mazraoui conduct their medicals in Manchester, Wan-Bissaka is likely to be nearing the completion of his. In terms of the deal for De Ligt, this transfer has been a long time coming for Erik ten Hag.",
      "The United boss wanted to make De Ligt one of his big summer purchases in the summer of 2022 during his first window at the club. However, a deal could not be completed and a move was postponed until the present day.",
      "As for Mazraoui, the Moroccan was a player who flourished for Ajax during Ten Hag's tenure at the club. When the Dutchman left for United, the full-back decided to move to Bayern to make the next step in his career.",
      "However, he has been frustrated by the lack of opportunities for minutes in Germany and is hopeful a reunion with Ten Hag will guarantee him more chances to impress. With the formalities the only thing standing in the way of both deals being officially announced, attention turns to when United fans will be able to see their new recruits in action for the first time.",
      "MEN Sport understands at this stage that United will be able to complete the deals before the registration deadline for Friday's opener against Fulham. This means that both Mazraoui and De Ligt could make their debuts at the Theatre of Dreams this weekend.",

      "A supercomputer has predicted the opening day of the Premier League season, and it's great news for Manchester United fans.",
      "New data collated by BetVictor shows that United could be lining up yet another matchday one win against Fulham on Friday night. Analysis provided by this supercomputer has suggested that Erik ten Hag's squad are likely to secure three points against the London side, based on their incredible record on the opening day of the season.",
      "United have won 21 of their 32 matches on the first day of the campaign, averaging 2.16 points per game (PPG). They've only lost five times in that remarkable spell, with six draws rounding off the data.",
      "Ten Hag's side secured three points at Old Trafford on the opening day of last season as Raphael Varane nodded home from close range against Wolves. United's record against Fulham also makes for good reading – the Red Devils have only lost once at home against Friday's visitors since 2003, albeit that defeat did come last season.",
      "On the other hand, Manchester City aren't as fortunate with their matchday one record, averaging just 1.85 PPG over 26 matches since 1992. The reigning champions have won 14, drawn six and lost six of their opening day games in the Prem.",
      "However, half of those victories have come under Pep Guardiola, who has won seven of his eight matches at the beginning of a new campaign. City have scored 19 goals and conceded just three under the Catalan on the opening day. They'll be hoping to improve that impressive record against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "Sam Boswell, spokesperson of BetVictor, said: \"The new Premier League season is an exciting time for all fans across the division, with each team starting from a level playing field. Hopes will be high for many, and Manchester United supporters should take confidence from their previous performances on the first game of the season – no team since 1992 has earned more points on Gameweek 1.",
      "\"Traditional powerhouses Chelsea and Liverpool have proved a tough nut to crack first up too but for Crystal Palace and Southampton, they will need to buck the trend of past performances to make a quick start to the 2024-25 campaign.\"",

      "United have made routine changes to Old Trafford across the summer - certain parts of the stadium have been repainted and the players' tunnel has been renovated - and a new poster has been put up.",
      "The glass on the outside of the East Stand is covered by a poster of United's players each season and Rashford was the first face to be printed opposite the Holy Trinity statue. United will begin the 2024/25 Premier League season against Fulham on Friday and workmen were present at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon to erect the new poster.",
      "Rashford is pictured in this season's new home kit and was joined on the posted by Mason Mount come Monday morning.",
      "United were defeated by Manchester City in the Community Shield on penalties last weekend and Rashford started the game at Wembley but missed two big chances. Although the academy graduate is one of the most recognisable faces for fans around the world, his form dipped last season and he contributed just eight goals in all competitions.",
      "Some United supporters suggested Rashford should have been sold this summer, but a move away wasn't on the cards and he will attempt to recapture his best form this term. Paris Saint-Germain have a longstanding interest in Rashford, who signed a new five year contract last summer, but are more likely to land Jadon Sancho in this window.",
      "Mount was the next player to be printed on the poster and the MEN revealed last month that United weren't looking to sell the midfielder after a poor first season. There are staff within United who believe Mount had a false start last year due to injury and believe the new campaign is an opportunity for him to show why he was signed.",
      "United were questioned for signing Mount last summer because Bruno Fernandes is considered undroppable as the No.10 and Kobbie Mainoo was on the cusp of the first-team. Mainoo became a consistent starter for United in the second half of the season and impressed for England at Euro 2024 while Mount was overlooked by the Three Lions again. Mount has not played for England since their World Cup quarter-final defeat to France in 2022.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt left Noussair Mazraoui waiting at Munich Airport this morning as the Bayern Munich players flew to England for their Manchester United medicals.",
      "United have had two transfer offers totalling an initial £51.5million accepted by Bayern for the pair. They will pay £38.6m and £4.3m in add-ons while spreading the payments over three years for De Ligt and £12.9m for Mazraoui, with add-ons taking that deal to around £17m.",
      "It comes a month after De Ligt verbally agreed personal terms during the European Championship. The club instead moved to sign Leny Yoro last month amid interest from Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.",
      "READ MORE:United face immediate De Ligt and Mazraoui concerns",
      "READ MORE:When De Ligt and Mazraoui could make United debuts as medicals scheduled",
      "Since then, they have also identified Mazraoui as a replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who is due to sign for West Ham United. Super-agent Rafaela Pimenta represents both players.",
      "They are now closing in on completing moves to United and were spotted arriving at Munich's international airport earlier today. Mazraoui came in first, with De Ligt following and telling Sky Germany reporters awaiting them outside: \"Noussair is waiting for me!\"",
      "The Dutch defender seemingly was delayed arriving at the airport, which meant their flight to Manchester took off roughly half an hour late. Medicals at United's training complex are scheduled for later today, and the club expects to conclude both deals early this week.",
      "They are preparing to announce the double signing, with club sources saying the separate deals are progressing while acknowledging that visas will be needed for the two players. The deals are set to coincide with Wan-Bissaka departing, with United prepared to top-up the player's wages at West Ham until next summer, potentially to the tune of £5.6m.",
      "The west London club could end up paying as much as £20m for the right-back. Wan-Bissaka signed for £50m from Crystal Palace five years ago.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has been dubbed \"the best\" coach that ex-Manchester United star Tom Heaton has ever worked with after he arrived at Old Trafford as Erik Ten Hag's right-hand man.",
      "Van Nistelrooy will be fondly remembered by Red Devils fans for his incredible five-year stint between 2001 and 2006, scoring 150 goals and bagging 30 assists alongside Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane and David Beckham.",
      "Despite retiring from playing in 2012, the Dutchman has been incredibly busy in the world of football management - taking the reins of PSV Eindhoven U19s in 2018, spending a season at Jong PSV in 2021, and ultimately managing PSV's first team between 2022 and 2023 to a second-place finish in the Eredivisie.",
      "And under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership of Man United and a complete club reshuffle, the 48-year-old has returned to the North West to help guide the Red Devils to Premier League greatness once more, alongside Ten Hag. While the two were previously unknown to each other on a personal level, Ten Hag recommended Van Nistelrooy for the assistant manager job.",
      "Van Nistelrooy's presence and knowledge of the game quickly impressed United bosses - earning him a contract until the summer of 2026. While he has been invaluable to United's current strikers and attacking midfielders, the former striker has also previously imparted his advice on decorated goalkeepers to help them understand their in-game competition - with Heaton dubbing him \"the best\" he's worked with.",
      "The now 38-year-old, who has been in meetings with the Dutchman, admitted: \"I was always his go-to goalkeeper for shooting. If that was a goal there, he’d always say he had four squares so I was almost irrelevant as a goalie. It wouldn’t matter where I was, he’d always have it in his mind that it was on him about where he was on the pitch.",
      "\"He’d be hitting one of those four squares and he used to hit in early — like a dart — and you just couldn’t save it. He was the best I’ve worked with. It was so good to see him. And he’s been brilliant. His level of detail is superb. You’d be forgiven for thinking: ‘He’s a United legend coming in, is he just a face for it?’ But I’ve been in a couple of meetings and he’s been outstanding.\"",
      "United saw a record-low eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign, and will no doubt hope to return to their glory days as soon as possible. Nobody has managed to replicate the successes of Sir Alex Ferguson since he departed Old Trafford in 2013 after a near-27-year reign.",
      "But Ten Hag is optimistic Van Nistelrooy can help Man United get back on track, telling the club website in July: \"I am delighted that Rene [Hake] and Ruud have agreed to join our project, adding a wealth of experience, knowledge and new energy to the staff.",
      "\"Now is a good time to refresh the coaching team as we look to build on the achievements of the past two years and push to the next level.\" Also arriving at the club this summer is former Go Ahead Eagles head honcho Rene Hake, who brings 21 years of managerial experience to the table.",
      "New sporting director, Dan Ashworth added: \"Together with Erik, we are working to strengthen all areas of our men’s first-team operations, and refreshing the coaching staff is an important part of that. It’s a particular pleasure to welcome Ruud back to the club where he enjoyed so much success as a player, and I know that he and Rene will help reinforce the winning mentality and high standards we are aiming for.\"",

      "Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has already gained Kylian Mbppe's seal of approval, amid links with a move to PSG.",
      "Once considered an indispensable talent at United, Rashford endured a worrying dip in form last season, leading manager Erik ten Hag to come to his defence. The forward missed out on a place in the England squad for Euro 2024 as a result and has since been touted with a move away from Old Trafford, with PSG emerging as a possible destination - though talks have gone quiet in recent weeks.",
      "The French champions have an obvious void to fill in attack after Mbappe finally completed his long-awaited move to Real Madrid this summer. When the pair crossed paths in 2019, Mbappe was full of praise for Rashford, who has been mentioned as his possible successor at the Parc des Princes.",
      "In the second leg of their Champions League clash, United staged a remarkable comeback as a brace from Romelu Lukaku cancelled out PSG's two-goal advantage before Rashford stepped up to the penalty spot in added time to send Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side through to the quarter-finals. After full-time, Mbappe lauded Rashford's mentality, making it clear that he thinks PSG would be right to try and sign him.",
      "\"When you take a penalty in that situation, how much practice you have put on the training ground doesn't matter,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about confidence. He's a player who plays with so much confidence. He's one of the most dangerous forward players in England. Paul Pogba has spoken about how special he is and he doesn't talk about players in such a way often.\"",
      "The following two seasons saw Rashford score a combined 43 goals in all competitions. He suffered his first major dip in form during the 2021/22 campaign, ending with five goals, due to a mix of injury and illness.",
      "However, he enjoyed his career-best season the following year as Erik ten Hag took the reins at Old Trafford. A phenomenal 30-goal return looked to be the sign of Rashford hitting his peak years- but the forward only managed a meagre eight goals last term.",
      "With Rasmus Hojlund leading the line, Rashford played out wide with only Antony to challenge him on the left flank. Missing out on Euro 2024 and his importance to United taking a hit has led to Rashford's name being mentioned in transfer rumours this summer.",
      "Although it is unlikely that Rashford will leave his boyhood club, PSG have the financial power to make the deal happen. United have reportedly put a £70m-plus price tag on Rashford, who previously attracted interest from the French outfit in 2022.",
      "PSG have lost their global star and could need a new high-profile winger to replace him. With Mbappe aware of the quality that Rashford possesses, the United forward could be the man to replace him, as improbable as it may seem.",

The former Watford and Sheffield United man has been credited with making massive improvements in the academy, and that is now filtering into the first team.",
      "After impressing Erik ten Hag this time last year during pre-season, midfielder Kobbie Mainoo went onto play a key role in the season. His performances earned him a call up to the England team for Euro 2024.",

      "Ten Hag has shown with Mainoo that he is not afraid of putting young players in if they impress. That’s a good sign for both Collyer and Amass ahead of the new season, but their development is good news for United, even if they don’t break into the first team.",
      "Their performances mean that clubs will be willing to pay good money if they are sold now or in the future. The fact that they are both academy graduates means that any fee made will go down as pure profit on the club’s accounts.",
      "If that is the case, then it will be a big boost for United given the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs). Any pure profit made will also come at a time when United need it the most, given the club's recent record on player sales and the money needed for both the new stadium and for incoming transfers.",

      "How does it feel to play for Manchester United in front of thousands of fans at just 17 years old?",
      "Just ask Harry Amass, who started against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on tour in the USA.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" he said. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side. You might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass spoke to Manchester-based reporters in the mixed zone in the Snapdragon Stadium last week and a start against Liverpool in Columbia followed that conversation.",
      "The youngster was asked about a potential start in the Community Shield against Manchester City and said: \"No conversations have been had yet, but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke [Shaw] and Tyrell [Malacia] come back.",
      "\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Luke Shaw started for England in the final of the European Championship against Spain and has been given an extended break, while Tyrell Malacia is still recovering from injury.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in June last year and has faced a prolonged period on the sidelines due to a knee injury, which required two rounds of surgery.",
      "The 24-year-old is expected to be available again in two months, which opens the door for Amass, and the London-born full-back intends to capitalise on the opportunity.",
      "After just one year at United, Amass has already drawn comparisons to Shaw, who swapped the South for the North himself when he was a teenager. \"It is a good comparison,\" he said.",
      "\"In my opinion, [Shaw is] one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain at the comparisons!\"",
      "United thought Shaw had the quality to play at Old Trafford for 10 years when he was signed from Southampton in 2014 and they recognised similar potential in Amass when he was signed from Watford last summer, a move that was considered a coup given the interest from other clubs.",
      "Amass was persuaded to sign for United and hasn't looked back. He was tremendous for the Under-18s last season, playing a key role in a supremely talented team that won a treble, and is now on the cusp of making his senior debut after delivering mature pre-season performances.",
      "Anyone who has watched Amass will understand there can be no concerns about his ability, talent or mentality. He is a technically exceptional, modern-day full-back, but the only question mark against the youngster was whether he was physical enough for senior football.",
      "Amass is diminutive but proved himself on the pre-season tour. His 'aggression' compensates for his lack of stature and he got the better of Mohamed Salah at the weekend.",
      "Malacia won't be involved in the squad for the Community Shield against City on Saturday and Shaw won't have the fitness to play 90 minutes at Wembley.",
      "Amass is almost guaranteed to be involved in some capacity and that will highlight his impressive progress in the space of just a few months, as the youngster only got close to the pitch when he warmed up on the sidelines when he was last at Wembley for the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Amass, Ethan Wheatley, Habeeb Ogunneye and Louis Jackson on a handful of benches at the end of last season due to the injury crisis and any observers would have noticed how slight they looked, which is normal at their age, in the pre-match warm-ups.",
      "However, what Amass lacks in physicality, he makes up for in character, aggression and talent, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see him start against City in the Community Shield.",

      "\"Quite a few of us wanted it and we had a bit of banter about it!\" Wheatley says of the 250 milestone. He is stood with Amass and Collyer, both smiling ruefully in the Snapdragon Stadium mixed zone.",
      "Southerners Collyer and Amass are doing their utmost to extend the number to 251 as soon as possible. United expect Collyer, Amass and Wheatley to remain with the squad beyond the transfer window.",
      "Collyer, 20, has started in three of United's four pre-season games and strapped on the captain's armband for the second half against Rosenborg. The 17-year-old Amass has lined up in both tour games in the United States.",
      "Left back Amass followed up his invaluable 45 minutes against Arsenal in Los Angeles, where he was blindsided by Gabriel Jesus for the equalising goal, with a complete performance against Real Betis in San Diego. He capped it with an assist for Amad and drew approval from the crowd with his tenacious tackling.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" the Londoner says. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side, you might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass only joined the United academy from Watford last year. Such was his importance during the run-in last season, Erik ten Hag checked on his well-being in the Carrington canteen when the academy squad returned from their title-clinching win at Wolves in April.",
      "Luke Shaw only played 15 times for United last term and Tyrell Malacia's absence from club football is nearing 15 months. Amass could conceivably start the Community Shield against Manchester City on Saturday.",
      "\"No conversations have been had yet,\" he admits, \"but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke and Tyrell come back. My intention is to play first team football at this club.",
      "\"I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Diminutive, fleet-footed and attack-minded, there are obvious parallels with the great Barcelona and Spain left back Jordi Alba. Shaw is another Cockney left back who has settled in Manchester for a decade.",
      "Amass approves of that comparison. \"It is a good comparison. In my opinion one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain about the comparison!\"",
      "\"We have to make progress,\" Ten Hag said on Amass. \"But we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie, but he (Amass) is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.",
      "\"But in this moment he needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Collyer, signed from Brighton as an 18-year-old two years ago, trained under Ten Hag as early as September 2022. He is one of only three academy players whose contract signing Ten Hag insisted on attending. The other two were Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"I think it's a massive boost,\" Collyer says of Ten Hag's attendance for his signing ceremony. \"It shows obviously he rates me as a player. Just onwards and upwards really, just got to give my best every day and see what happens.\"",
      "Collyer came on for half-an-hour at the Snapdragon Stadium and thwarted Betis twice in injury time with valiant interventions. He has acquitted himself impressively and United need to bring down the average age of their midfield department.",
      "\"When you're on the bench I think it's really valuable just to be in and around it, experience what it's like on a matchday,\" Collyer explains. \"In the changing room, on the bench, with a crowd, getting used to it. Now I've managed to get quite a lot of minutes in pre-season, so I'm happy.",
      "\"I'd say with me, a lot of my work is off the ball as well. Predominantly, I'm a really busy player, I like to get about the pitch and an area of my game I'd like to improve on is in possession. So I think the only way you're going to get better is by demanding the ball, getting on it and not backing away from situations when you could.\"",
      "Ten Hag made a beeline for Mainoo after United's League Cup victory last year and back at Wembley 15 months later, did likewise with Collyer after United won the FA Cup. \"He just said take it all in, enjoy myself and keep working hard and you never know what can happen,\" Collyer reveals.",
      "\"He's a really good guy, the manager. With everyone, he tells you what he wants from each player, he tries his best to help you out, as well as with the other coaching staff as well.",
      "\"At the end of the day, they do everything for us and we have to put it out on the pitch and give everything for them.\"",
      "Stockport-born Wheatley was one of a handful of positives from the listless defeat to Rosenborg last month. He can expect to continue training with the first team amid Rasmus Hojlund's six-week absence with a hamstring strain.",
      "\"I'm just taking everything as it comes, to be honest,\" he cautions. \"Obviously, I had a little taste of it last season. This season, I just want to keep my head down, keep developing as a player and keep impressing, so hopefully get more chances.",
      "\"The club, its history is of bringing through loads of academy players, the likes of Kobbie, playing with us less than a year ago and breaking into the first team, inspires us and motivates us. Because we know the pathway is there. If we impress, get the chances that will be given at this club we'll take them.\"",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has not rejoined United as a striker coach but Wheatley, born in the same year that Van Nistelrooy left United, is picking his brains. \"I think especially since Ruud came in, obviously he was a top striker, he was probably one of the best strikers we've had at the club.",

      "Manchester United have a number of areas that need to be improved, but the club selected three priority areas this summer.",
      "A striker and a centre-back have arrived, while it is thought that Erik ten Hag is closing in on a new midfielder, Manuel Ugarte. While Leny Yoro’s three-month setback could push United into another centre-half signing this window, other positions may need some attention.",
      "One of those is left-back, given how injuries decimated options there last season. Luke Shaw is back to fitness but only played 15 matches last term due to issues and is yet to go through a full season at United without injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Tyrell Malacia is not expected to return until October, having not played in more than a year due to setbacks in his rehabilitation from serious surgery. Sergio Reguilon was acquired on loan last deadline day but returned to Tottenham in January after Ten Hag ended his stay early, with Shaw and Malacia both expected back soon. That never happened.",
      "As a result, Diogo Dalot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and even Victor Lindelof had to cover in the role with full-back options stretched. Sorting another loan this summer to cover for Malacia would be sensible.",
      "But meanwhile, academy recruit Harry Amass has impressed so far in pre-season, most notably against Real Betis. The 17-year-old joined from Watford last August with big hopes for the future, and the first fruits of his potential are starting to show.",
      "A few first-team stints this coming season followed by consistent progress, and United might not need to find a new left-back when Shaw’s contract runs out in 2027, saving a good few million. For now, third-choice at United is an ample status, and the reality is that the team might still need more experienced cover at left-back via a loanee until Malacia returns.",
      "Another area of debate is the right-wing position. On paper, United have a number of options there, with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford able to play in the role, Alejandro Garnacho too, albeit to limited effect.",
      "In reality, the spot has hardly been nailed down in Ten Hag’s tenure, with Antony underwhelming his £85m price tag, Rashford preferring the left flank far more, and Sancho falling out with the manager, a feud that has now been quashed.",
      "There has been good reason to suggest that the right wing needs a new addition, but United need not bother. Amad can save United a good few quid in the short term with his assets from the right, as shown against Real Betis.",
      "His breakaway goal against Liverpool in last season’s FA Cup tie showed the raw talent he has, something that former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray was never shy to underline during Amad’s 14-goal loan spell at the Black Cats two seasons ago.",
      "Amad has now scored twice in pre-season, for what that is worth. His goal against Rangers might have felt sweet given his torrid former prior loan spell in Scotland.",
      "But it was against Real Betis that he showed what he can do when he has minutes under his belt, scoring United’s second of the game after winning a penalty for their first. After recovering from a long-term injury in time for the second half of the season, Amad only managed to start the final three league games.",
      "Now 22, the attacker has the confidence and ability to show he can challenge and perhaps usurp Antony on the right for more starts. Either way, his resurgence has saved United from forking out millions for another",

      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of promising young talent Chido Martin-Obi after the youngster turned down a new contract at Premier League rivals Arsenal. The Gunners are said to have pulled out all the stops to tie the 16-year-old down to fresh terms, but it's United who look set to win the race for the Denmark-born striker.",
      "Obi-Martin, who scored 29 goals in 17 league matches for Arsenal's Under-18s last year, went from strength to strength last season, notably scoring 10 goals in a single game against Liverpool. It's understood United's head of the academy, Nick Cox, and the head of academy recruitment, Luke Fedorenko, are the main driving forces behind the deal.",
      "Once the i's have been dotted and the t's crossed, it will be a significant coup for United's youth set-up which has been undergoing a renaissance after a period of underachieving and Cox's appointment as head of academy in 2019 was a key moment.",
      "The Manchester Evening News spoke with football.london's chief Arsenal writer Kaya Kaynak for an insight into Martin-Obi, his understanding of the deal and what sort of player he is ahead of his arrival in Manchester.",
      "Kaya Kaynak: \"It's a bit hard to say as he's still so young, but one thing he seems to be very good at is scoring goals. He's quite a bit taller than most others around his age group right now and looks stylistically a bit similar to Alexander Isak with his languid running and technical ability.\"",
      "KK: \"Arsenal were really keen to keep him. They pulled out all the stops and were confident of doing so after keeping other young talents like Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in recent years.",
      "\"However, they do feel they offered all they were willing to offer. With that in mind, there's a feeling of acceptance at the decision Chido has decided to take.\"",
      "KK: \"Any player who scores as many goals as Chido did at such a young age is going to be thought of very highly. It's probably fair to say was viewed as one of the top three or four prospects right now.",
      "\"Arsenal are constantly using internal analytics to assess the trajectory of their players and he did look to be a promising talent. At the same time though, it's so hard to tell at 16 and many were intrigued to see how he would have coped at a higher age level.\"",
      "KK: \"I'd say so. There's clearly a high-potential player in there. He's someone who can score lots of goals and that's not easy to find.",
      "\"The big test for him will be seeing how he steps up through the age groups. If he manages that though, United have a real player on their hands.\"",
      "KK: \"I think the fact that he was in such high demand this summer tells you what a good player he is. He was wanted by clubs across Europe as well as in England.\"",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",
      "\"Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that. Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",

Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber.

      "England goalkeeper Mary Earps says she is hoping to add \"a few more trophies to the cabinet\" after leaving Manchester United to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).",
      "Earps joined the Reds in 2019 and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. However, the shot-stopper opted to embark on a new chapter when her contract expired in June after a disappointing Women's Super League (WSL) campaign saw United finished fifth last term - 21 points worse off than in the previous campaign.",
      "Despite being linked with a move to Arsenal, Earps chose to join PSG, who have qualified for the Women's Champions League for six consecutive seasons. Speaking on the latest episode of the BBC's Tooney & Russo Show, Earps said she has established some \"great relationships\" in Manchester, but her decision to leave was fueled by \"the opportunity to play for a great team in top competitions\" and be \"in a position to win silverware\".",
      "\"It's like an itch you can never scratch enough,” Earps said. And the 31-year-old's former United teammate Ella Toone, who also plays alongside Earps for the Lionesses, was full of praise for the goalkeeper.",
      "\"She deserves everything,\" said Toone. \"Mary's dream - and it always has been - is to play at the highest level, play in the Champions League and that's what she's done.\"",
      "Earps is not the only player to have left United this summer, with captain Katie Zelem and forward Lucia Garcia also having departed. Reflecting last month on her decision to move overseas, Earps wrote on Instagram: \"The club is about to undergo a period of transition, and unfortunately I don’t feel it aligns with the timing of where I’m at in my career, therefore I think now is the right time to make a change and embark on a new challenge.\"",

      "As Manchester United set to work dismantling Tottenham Hotspur in the Women's FA Cup final, there was one player inside Wembley Stadium whose loyalties were split.",
      "Grace Clinton, who joined United from Everton in 2022, had spent the season on loan at Spurs and was therefore ineligible to feature against her parent club. Her absence was a huge blow for Robert Vilahamn's side, who ultimately fell to a 4-0 defeat in north-west London as the Reds romped to their first major piece of silverware.",
      "Clinton had been a revelation during her season-long stint at Brisbane Road, completing a clean sweep of Tottenham's Player of the Season awards and breaking into the senior Lionesses squad. \"She will be the next superstar in this country if you ask me,\" Vilahamn said after the midfielder's impressive start to life on loan. \"I think she's brilliant and has the potential to be so good.\"",
      "Clinton form was so good, in fact, that Tottenham were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "The 21-year-old - who also excelled on loan at Championship side Bristol City in 2022/23 - seemed to relish her time at Spurs, forging a close friendship with teammate Celin Bizet and flourishing under the watchful eye of Vilahamn. “Confidence for me comes from the manager, and both Robert and (England boss) Sarina (Wiegman) have given me so much of that this season,” Clinton told the MEN earlier this year.",
      "“This season I’ve just been filled with confidence and I think you can see that on the pitch. That freedom and confidence from them has allowed me to go and express myself.”",
      "This week, however, seemed to draw a definite line under Clinton's Tottenham adventure, with the midfielder taking to social media to pen an emotional farewell to the Lilywhites. \"This past year was by far my happiest season of football,\" she wrote on Instagram.",
      "\"I loved every minute at this club and I’ve made friends for life along the way. I’m so beyond grateful to the staff and my teammates for making this club so special to be a part of. Most importantly thank you to our fans for your unbelievable support this past year, you truly helped us make history and those are moments I will cherish with me.\"",
      "While part of Clinton's heart might always belong to Spurs, her focus will now turn to transforming United into a consistent force in the Women's Super League (WSL), with the former Everton prodigy set to return to Leigh Sports Village as Marc Skinner's side ramp up their pre-season preparations. Despite beating Tottenham to the FA Cup trophy last term, the Reds faltered in the top flight, finishing in fifth place and winning just 10 of their league games.",
      "In spite of United's turbulent campaign, manager Skinner was somewhat controversially awarded a one-year contract extension by the club's hierarchy and the 41-year-old will surely now be delighted to have Clinton to call upon as he bids to turn the Reds' WSL fortunes around.",
      "Though he has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester, her return will be a huge boost for Skinner, particularly considering the club have parted company with midfield duo Katie Zelem and Irene Guerrero this summer.",
      "\"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" the United boss said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "Certainly, Clinton returns to United a much more well-rounded player than when she left, having gained valuable experience on both the domestic and international stage. The midfielder won her first senior cap for the Lionesses against Austria in February and took just 19 minutes to crown her eye-catching debut with a goal.",
      "\"She plays like a natural,\" Wiegman said after the game. \"She wants to have the ball. She picks up the things we talk about very quickly and that's what you see on the pitch too. She just goes out there and plays.\"",
      "Clinton has won a further two caps over the past five months and is surely destined for many more. But it is not only on the pitch where the youngster has learnt some valuable lessons of late.",
      "“Grace is a great girl,” Manchester City and England defender Alex Greenwood told the MEN in April. “You see her about and she's always wanting to ask questions, learn from everyone, and she's a really confident girl as well. She believes in herself and she always wants to improve, and I love that about Grace.",
      "“She was doing a press conference and so she came up to me and Lucy (Bronze) and said: ‘What can’t I say?’ That’s just an innocent question and that’s not even about football but it’s stuff that comes hand-in-hand now with playing for the Lionesses.",
      "“At dinner she asks questions like ‘What do you eat Al?’ I remember her first camp, we were on a walk before the game and I said: ‘Grace, you haven’t shut up this whole walk’...but it’s nice.”",
      "While it's clear Clinton still has plenty to learn - both on and off the pitch - her return could spell very good news for United as they look to bounce back from the disappointment of last season. Her time at Spurs may have played a vital role in shaping her career to date but it is the Reds who must now help England's \"next superstar\" fulfil her true potential.",
