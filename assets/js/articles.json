      "Coventry City will reportedly not receive any money if Sporting CP sell Viktor Gyokeres this summer, despite having negotiated a sell-on clause in his contract. The 27-year-old striker has caught the eye of several of Europe's biggest clubs since becoming one of the most lethal forwards on the continent in the past two seasons.",
      "Gyokeres netted a sensational 54 goals in 52 matches this term on his way to helping Sporting clinch a domestic double. Arsenal, Chelsea, Juventus and Manchester United, managed by his former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim, have all shown interest in signing the Swede this summer.",
      "While he has a £84.7million release clause in his Sporting contract, it was initially thought that a £59m bid would be enough for the Portuguese champions to part ways with their star player.",
      "However, their president Frederico Varandas has since rubbished those claims, stating there is no gentleman's agreement in place to allow Gyokeres to leave for £59m. Varandas maintained that the only promise made to Gyokeres was that the club wouldn't demand his full release clause.",
      "Regardless of the price tag Gyokeres eventually leaves Sporting for, Coventry may not see any financial gain from his sale. The Sweden international spent two seasons with the Championship side following an initial loan deal from Brighton, netting 40 goals in 97 games before joining Sporting for an initial £20m.",
      "TalkSPORT has now reported that City sold their clause to Sporting last summer, waiving their right to a future transfer windfall in order to fund their own £18m transfer overhaul. The sell-on clause was said to be worth 10 per cent of any profit on the initial fee Sporting paid to originally sign the player.",
      "However, the Coventry Telegraph reported last summer that the fee was actually reduced by just five percent after Sporting paid the Championship side €1m (£843,500), in addition to the player hitting “certain objectives” over the course of the season.",
      "Initially, Coventry stood to gain 15% of any profit on the initial fee paid by Sporting if Gyokeres was sold on. This percentage was subject to change based on the player's performance, including goals, appearances and club honours, which were add-ons to the initial fee, and amount to €2m (almost £1.7m).",
      "The Sky Blues are said to have received just over £2.5m in add-ons from the initial €20m (£17.5m) fee, bringing their earnings to date up to £20m.",
      "Despite the speculation surrounding Gyokeres, Sporting's Varandas has stated no official bids have been lodged yet. CNN Portugal supported that claim while saying Arsenal are leading the chase for the striker's signature, with the Gunners being his preferred pick over United.",
      "The report read: “Arsenal are the club that Gyokeres has wanted from the very beginning. Gyokeres wants to play for Arsenal, he has stated this desire very openly to his agent. Officially, there has not been an offer yet, but there have been many contacts. This time, it seems that there will be [an offer].”",
      "Portuguese newspaper Record reported that Arsenal’s hierarchy met with Gyokeres’ representative, Hasan Cetinkaya, on Wednesday and an official offer from the Gunners is now expected.",
      "However, reports elsewhere have stated Arsenal’s preference is to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer from RB Leipzig.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Mason Greenwood will play alongside former Manchester United team-mate Angel Gomes next season at Marseille. They will reunite in France five years after Gomes left the Red Devils, having once been left humiliated by former United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "Marseille confirmed this week that they have reached an agreement in principle to sign England international Gomes. The Ligue 1 runners-up, managed by Roberto De Zerbi, beat a host of clubs to his signature, with the 24-year-old reportedly signing a three-year deal at the Orange Velodrome.",
      "RMC Sport previously reported that the United academy graduate was convinced by De Zerbi's style of play and the opportunity to compete in the Champions League. Gomes had announced he would be leaving Lille once his contract expired this summer.",
      "The midfielder made the move to Lille at the end of his United contract in the summer of 2020, having been tipped for great things at Old Trafford after signing for the club back in 2006. The England U21s European Championship winner was handed his debut aged just 16 by Mourinho on the final day of the 2016/17 season, making him United's youngest ever Premier League player.",
      "But despite the trust placed in him by the current Fenerbahce boss, a 17-year-old Gomes was once brought to the brink of tears as a result of Mourinho criticising his performance in a reserve team match in front of the first team.",
      "He told the Athletic: \"I played a game for the reserves and he watched — he didn’t think I played good enough. Two days later, the first team had a game, and he took me with the team. At the pre-match, in front of everybody, he let me know about it.\"",
      "Expanding on the story in an interview with The Times, Gomes explained: \"At the time I was thinking, 'Why has he done that in front of everyone? Could he not have pulled me to the side?'",
      "\"A few of the players came up to me and said, 'He just wants a reaction from you, don't let it faze you', but in that moment, I didn't want to hear anything.",
      "'I rushed to my room and rang my dad and my brother. There's not much they could say to me really. I was almost crying. I was really young.",
      "\"It wasn't until I was older that I realised, with Mourinho, he's always looking at ways to get more out of you. I think him doing that in front of everyone showed he valued me as a player. I probably needed it.\"",
      "He added: \"It's all mental toughness. What I came to learn about Jose is he always wants you to do better. He is almost like prodding you, 'Come on, show me a bit more. Everyone's told me how good you are, but I want to see it.'\"",
      "Despite the psychological blow at the time, Gomes wishes he had been mature enough to embrace Mourinho's management style, saying: \"It wasn't until I left and I see Jose winning trophies that I think, 'Ah, I understand you. And if only I had understood you more, I would have been able to appreciate my time more with you'. But no, in the midst of little b*********s, [he was] an amazing guy.\"",
      "Gomes' departure came during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure, following Mourinho's sacking two years prior in 2018. His game time was extremely limited under Solskjaer while the then-promising Greenwood was enjoying his first-team breakthrough in the 2019/20 season.",
      "After playing a total of 320 minutes for United, Gomes left as a free agent, capping off the \"most difficult period\" of his career. Despite spending the first year of his five-year Lille stint at Portuguese club Boavista, the move to Ligue 1 served to kickstart his career. He made 134 appearances in all competitions for Lille, including 20 this season as they finished fifth in the league.",
      "He also impressed in a Three Lions shirt last year after receiving his first four caps under interim boss Lee Carsley. However, Gomes has not yet featured under new manager Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Sebastian Kehl, the Borussia Dortmund sporting director, has played down talk of a third move for Jadon Sancho after the Manchester United forward was linked with a shock return to the Bundesliga club.",
      "Sancho, 25, is out of favour at Old Trafford and spent the 2024-25 season on loan at Chelsea. He is at a career crossroads, though, with the Blues set to pay a £5million penalty fee rather than completing a £25m permanent transfer for the star.",
      "Despite originally being frozen out by Erik ten Hag, its understood Sancho has no future at United under the Dutchman's successor, Ruben Amorim.",
      "And with United desperate to offload several players who have been deemed surplus to requirements in order to raise transfer funds, talk of a return to Dortmund has materialised ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "The Athletic revealed Sancho's representatives had been informed of Dortmund's interest - but Kehl has said a deal for the forward is currently 'not a priority'.",
      "“Of course, contact with Jadon is always there, in some way, because we have a very long history,” Kehl ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup on Thursday.",
      "“But it’s not an issue for us right now. We have other priorities at the moment and that’s why the Sancho issue was probably played up more in the media than discussed internally.”",
      "Sancho established himself as one of Europe's brightest stars at Dortmund across a four-year spell before joining United in a £73m deal in the summer of 2021.",
      "And with his career at a standstill it was Dortmund who gave him a platform to play again during the second half of the 2023-24 campaign, where he helped his old club reach the final of the Champions League.",
      "Dortmund's reported interest in Sancho comes amid claims that a trio of Premier League clubs are interested in offering the winger a chance to kickstart his career.",
      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all said to be keeping an eye on Sancho's situation with a permanent exit from Old Trafford likely in the coming weeks. Villa took Sancho's United team-mate, Marcus Rashford, on loan for the second half of last season but a permanent deal does not appear to be on the cards, hence their interest in Sancho.",

The 27-year-old's performances in the Midlands earned him a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad as he found some positive momentum.",
      "The forward saw his season end prematurely due to injury and now is reminding potential suitors of his availability as he puts in work on the training ground. Rashford missed the final month of the season with a hamstring injury.",
      "But the striker has shown his progress conducting drills on Wednesday evening. Rashford has shared a video of himself doing a 'high knees' exercise on the grass.",

The Danish international has eight goals for his country, but only one of those has arrived since the end of 2023, and there's now a feeling he's no longer an automatic starter.",
      "Hojlund scored just five Premier League goals at club level last season, though his Europa League exploits allowed him to reach double figures in all competitions. He started the first game in Denmark's friendly double-header, drawing a blank against Northern Ireland, and dropped to the bench for the meeting with Lithuania on Tuesday.",
      "One man who has found goals much easier to come by at club level is compatriot Mika Biereth. The former Arsenal youngster hit the ground running for Monaco after joining in January, and made his senior international bow against Portugal in March.",
      "It was Biereth, not Hojlund, who partnered Kasper Dolberg up front in the Lithuania friendly. The 22-year-old wasted little time finding the net for the first time at senior international level, scoring the first of five Danish goals, and came in for praise post-match as compatriot Hojlund got a reminder of the challenge ahead.",

      "\"Try to think about how many times we have sat with a Danish national team and said: 'We are missing players, when will some strikers come?',\" Riemer told Viaplay (via Tipsbladet). \"We have so many young players, some of them may be just young enough to break through, but how great is it that we have so many knocking on the door – I think that is important to say.\"",

He is one of two men high on Arsenal's shipping list, along with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, as Mikel Arteta's team chases an elusive title after three successive runner-up finishes.",
      "Arsenal can offer the former Coventry City hotshot a chance to play for a Champions League contender, with Arteta having led his team to the semi-finals last season. Premier League rivals United can't match that, but they could yet tempt Gyokeres with a reunion with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim in Manchester.",

It also points to reports elsewhere on the continent that United remain keen on a deal and have remained in contact with representatives for Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres has a significant release clause in his contract, but suitors might not need to meet it despite his impressive return of 54 goals in 52 games this season. Back in April, it was claimed that around £60million should be enough to land the Scandinavian.",

      "Things have seemingly taken a sour turn in Lisbon very quickly after it emerged Gyokeres was not happy with Sporting, where he has become an icon in two seasons. It's alleged the Sweden striker was under the impression a 'gentleman's agreement' would allow him to leave for around £59million this summer.",
      "But after scoring 97 times in 102 appearances for the Lions, it seems Sporting are intent on receiving the full value of his £85m release clause if he's to leave. And it's led to claims Gyokeres will go on strike if needed in order to force through a dream move this summer.",
      "CNN Portugal reported Cetinkaya met with Arsenal's owners on Wednesday in an effort to expedite a deal. The Gunners reportedly sent a delegation to Lisbon last month to discuss a potential move for Sporting's prolific frontman.",
      "The update suggests talks between the two parties are \"very advanced.\" And although Arsenal's representatives have met with Sporting in the past, it's understood matters are now looking more formal ahead of a potential deal being struck.",
      "It's also suggested that a move to the Emirates Stadium has been Gyokeres' preference \"from the very beginning.\" And it could mean United boss Ruben Amorim, the man who brought him to Portugal from Coventry City, is left out in the cold.",
      "Gyokeres' inner circle have already made it clear they want him to remain in Lisbon. The player's uncle, Chris, revealed at the Taca de Portugal final, where Gyokeres forced extra time before lifting the title, that the family encouraged their star to stick in his current surroundings.",
      "When asked if the family felt a connection to Lisbon, he told Sport.TV: \"Yes, very much. Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "Not only that, but Gyokeres' girlfriend, Ines Aguiar, has also campaigned for him to stick around. According to A Bola, she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting despite the swell of transfer interest.",
      "Gyokeres recently ruled out a return to his home nation and told Swedish Vogue: \"After living in a warm country, it would be difficult. In Sweden, people work hard during the week and only socialize on the weekends. Here there is more life during the week. They have dinners with friends, a glass of wine on Monday. I like that.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta's side may have left United in their wake after seemingly moving ahead in discussions. Arsenal appear to be intent on making up for last year's shortcomings by signing an elite striker this summer.",
      "Injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus left the club short last season despite calls to add to their forward department. And it left new signing Mikel Merino with the responsibility of leading the line for much of this season.",
      "The Spaniard did well in his makeshift role and scored 10 goals between January and May. However, the Gunners are under no illusion that a more natural talent is required up top, and the benefit of offering Champions League football is a major advantage over United.",
      "The same can be said for United after a record-low finish of 15th in the Premier League. The likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to set the world alight as hoped at Old Trafford, with Amorim now seeking to make his own mark on the squad.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, isn't the only forward target believed to be on Arsenal's radar. The club has been closely linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko this summer, with the club's hierarchy seemingly keen on the Slovenia international.",
      "However, recent developments would suggest Gyokeres remains the preferred pick if the Gunners get their way. And it may mean United are left devastated as a direct rival hoovers up one of the most coveted talents on the market."

      "Jadon Sancho is commanding interest from three Premier League clubs and looks set to be on the move once again this summer. Ruben Amorim has decided the England international will not be part of his first team squad and is said to have no plans to integrate him into the set-up.",
      "Chelsea made their decision to not make Sancho's move permanent official as they named their Club World Cup squad on Wednesday. The Blues were forced to stump up £5million to send the winger back to United after they had satisfied condititions to make the deal permanent.",
      "Aston Villa, Tottenham and Newcastle are all keeping tabs on the 25-year-old's situation as the Red Devils look to facilitate an exit. Unai Emery's side prefer a loan deal for the ex-Borussia Dortmund star, having taken Marcus Rashford on a temporary basis in January.",
      "United would prefer a sale to bolster their funds amidst a busy summer of rebuilding, as they attempt to replenish Amorim's squad. Already the club have spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and a significant fee is expected to land Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",

      "Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has claimed that blackmail and threats will not force him to agree to a transfer for Viktor Gyokeres. It has been said that the forward is willing to go on strike after he believed the club had went back on their word over the fee they were willing to accept for a move.",
      "Gyokeres has drawn interest from across Europe and the Saudi Pro League, with Arsenal and Manchester United among contenders for his signature. The 27-year-old is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.",

      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres' fury is said to stem from his belief that the Portuguese giants are demanding £67m, a figure almost £10m more than he expected. While Varandas accepted the club will not demand the player's release clause be activated, he attempted to explain what he considers the truth of the agreement made with Gyokeres' agent.",
      "New Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana played a crucial role, while he was still with Sporting, before Varandas was required to enter negotiations.",
      "\"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season,\" Varandas explained.",
      "\"During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him. When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.",
      "\"Viana manages the relationship with the agents, and very well, this is done by the sporting director. One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the value of the €100m (£85m) clause next year.",
      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",
      "\"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27. Then, we knew Viktor's dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "\"We guaranteed that we would not demand €100m. In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of €60m, €70m... And I said 'there's no point in setting a value because I don't know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season... There's no point in setting a value, I don't know if it will be €40m, €60m or €80m (£34, £51 or £68m). What I can guarantee is that I will not demand €100m'.",
      "\"From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. 10 months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word. The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\"",

      "Manchester United legends Dwight Yorke and Paul Scholes agree that the club must sign Eberechi Eze for £68million this summer. Eze, 26, has been outstanding since joining Crystal Palace in 2020 and enjoyed his best season to date in 2024/25.",
      "The playmaker scored 14 goals and registered 11 assists for Oliver Glasner’s side, including netting the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City to hand the Eagles their first-ever major trophy. That impressive form has seen the England international linked with rival Premier League clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And during England’s 3-1 defeat to Senegal on Tuesday, where Eze played the full 90 minutes, United hero Scholes saw enough evidence to believe he would thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "Taking to Instagram during the game, Scholes posted a picture of Eze in an England shirt with a three-word transfer plea, telling United bosses to: “Just buy him.”",
      "Eze reportedly has a £68m release clause in his Palace contract, which can be activated this summer. Speaking last month, Scholes’ former Red Devils team-mate, Dwight Yorke, also urged United to make a move for the player.",
      "“Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United,\" Yorke said. “Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it’s not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million.",
      "“Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players. Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are.",
      "“Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.”",
      "Former QPR talent Eze was outstanding again for England this week despite a woeful overall team performance. He stood out in a central role, winning the ball back from Lamine Camara in the lead-up to England’s opening goal.",
      "But he truly came alive after the hour mark, combining excellently with substitutes Morgan Gibbs-White and Morgan Rogers by being at the heart of England’s best period of the game.",
      "Despite excelling in a No. 10 role, Eze would likely play just behind the striker in Ruben Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1 formation if United manage to sign him. Any such deal could also see him partner up with the likes of Bruno Fernandes and new signing Matheus Cunha to form an exciting new front three.",
      "United are, however, prioritising the signing of a new striker and appear to be settled on going for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo over the likes of other attack-minded midfielders like Eze after it was revealed that Fernandes would stay at the club this summer.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is believed to be their number one target, though United have also been linked with Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko to a lesser extent.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Tottenham are on course to have a deal wrapped up for Brentford's Thomas Frank. The Danish coach is set to be the man to succeed Europa League-winning boss Ange Postcoglou in north London but the changes aren't likely to stop there.",
      "Frank is a coach rather than a manger and will be tasked with improving the squad at his disposal. But after the Lilywhites finished in 17th position, the 51-year-old will rarely have a stronger position to negotiate from over what he requires in the transfer market.",
      "There will be key decisions to make over a number of players with the future of captain Son Heung-min a hot topic. But Tottenham technical director Johan Lange will be the figure heading up much of the recruitment, possibly alongside a returning Fabio Paratici.",
      "With a return to Champions League football to manage in addition to the battles of the Premier League, the pressure will be on Frank to deliver on both fronts. And perhaps a new player or two can help boost Spurs' numbers and quality ahead of a better season.",
      "Guglielmo Vicario is set to remain the club's No.1 with the likes of January signing Antonin Kinsky to provide back-up. Goalkeepers Fraser Forster, 37, and Alfie Whiteman, 26, are both set to be released at the expiry of their contracts.",
      "The Spurs backline will see Kevin Danso make his loan move permanent this summer after arriving amidst the club's injury nightmare midway through the season. Already there is some competition with talented stars such as Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Radu Dragusin at Frank's disposal.",
      "With Dragusin still recovering from an ACL injury and Romero being linked to a possible exit for Atletico Madrid, perhaps there is room for another however. Spurs have already been linked to Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, AS Roma defender Evan Ndicka and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi.",
      "If Spurs can take advantage of Guehi entering the final year of his contract with the Eagles, perhaps he his most likely to slip into a backline including Pedro Porro, Van de Ven and Destiny Udogie.",
      "In midfield Frank will have talented youngsters to choose from in Lucas Bergvall and Pape Matar Sarr, while only one of older options Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur is likely to extend their stay via a new contract. The latter could help provide a base alongside Sarr if Spurs plan to stick with the players they have.",
      "Adam Wharton and Eberechi Eze have both drawn interest from Tottenham but could prove difficult to prise away from Selhurst Park ahead of Oliver Glasner's side heading into Europe and being notoriously tough negotiators. With James Maddison already in the squad, Frank has an option to play in an advanced role and Dejan Kulusevski could also thrive in such a position.",
      "Across Spurs' frontline a familiar face could arrive in the form of Bryan Mbeumo to provide plenty of goalscoring threat from the right side. Frank is said to have asked for the Cameroon international to follow him from Brentford.",
      "On the opposite flank could be Son Heung-min but after securing his place as a Spurs legend by virtue of finally winning a trophy, he could find new competition. Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is of interest to Tottenham and would appear to fit in with Frank's philosophies.",
      "Up front, Dominic Solanke is the obvious option to lead the frontline. Son could provide some support in that position throughout the season, in addition to Richarlison but Solanke will be handed the responsibility.",
      "Dream Tottenham XI: Vicario; Porro, Guehi, Van de Ven, Udogie; Bentancur, Sarr; Mbeumo, Kulusevski, Semenyo; Solanke.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho is heading towards the exit at Manchester United having failed to live up to the demands set by Erik ten Hag. United have slapped a £70million asking price on Garnacho in the hope he can help fund their summer rebuild, but even if he does leave for a big fee, the winger will do so having fallen short of Ten Hag’s expectations.",
      "Thankfully for United, there are interested parties, with Napoli, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all monitoring his situation. The 20-year-old returned 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season and his value is helped by the fact he is under contract until June 2028.",
      "It is that contract, worth £50,000-a-week and signed in May 2023, which prompted a challenge from Garnacho’s former manager, Ten Hag. While congratulating him on his deserved deal, the Dutchman - who is now reportedly among the managers that want to sign him - warned that it would lead to increased expectation.",
      "“First of all, I think he has the prize and it’s a prize,” he said. “He also shows he can make the final step – not only in talent but also, he made it. But now it’s a new start, a restart, because now the expectations will be higher, the demands definitely will be higher.",
      "“He is on his way, he is a strong character and that’s why he’s there in the moment on this level, and he did it by himself. But now is coming more work to go because the demands are higher, we expect more from him. But it’s great he made it because it tells we will give young players opportunities, but they have to deserve it.",
      "“When I say ‘give’, translate it to ‘deserve’ and they have to deserve with their feet, they have to show it on the pitch and that means you have to invest a lot and deserve it by training performances, by performance in the under-21s, then wait for your moment and prove it again.",
      "“For Alejandro, he is that step beyond but now the demands will be even more because he has now to compete for a starting XI position. So, every time is the same: you have to cross limits and every time you have to go in the next level. We go with him in that challenge but most important is the player has to do it.”",

      "Ayden Heaven received the ultimate compliment from Ruben Amorim on the final day of the season.",
      "Speaking after the 2-0 victory against Aston Villa, Amorim told MUTV: “I think once again Jason Wilcox is doing a great job bringing Ayden. I think these types of players are what we need.",
      "\"He showed a lot of quality and character after the big injury. We want these types of players.”",
      "Heaven delivered another assured performance against Villa to end a positive debut season at the club, which suggested United secured a bargain when they signed him for around £1million.",
      "Before Heaven's transfer from Arsenal was official, sources indicated he would be a first-team signing, which raised eyebrows considering he had only made one senior appearance.",
      "Mikel Arteta handed Heaven his senior Arsenal debut in a Carabao Cup tie in October, but he rejected a new contract in London and relocated to Manchester for a small transfer fee.",
      "Arsenal did what they could to keep Heaven, although they now may wish they had done a little bit more. Left-footed centre-backs are worth their weight in gold in modern football and Heaven has made a really pleasing start to life at Old Trafford, looking confident and composed at the back.",
      "Heaven has looked like a bargain signing and will continue to develop. His strong displays have merited a starting role in the team and he will be hopeful of contributing more next season.",
      "United signed a high-potential young defender and Heaven also has the right mentality away from the pitch to succeed, which was recently illustrated by him doing extra work with a private coach at his home.",
      "Heaven was tagged in a social media post that showed him doing personal coaching and game study with Andy Mangan, the former League One striker who now works at Stockport County.",
      "Mangan is well-respected in the coaching sphere and he was set to make a spectacular move to join Real Madrid's coaching staff, only to be denied due to a Brexit-related work permit issue.",
      "While most Premier League players are on holiday, Heaven has spent time working with Mangan, seemingly on positional work and analysing his games to determine what he can improve.",
      "That shows Heaven has the right mindset to succeed and Chido Obi, who was also signed from Arsenal, recently promised he will \"work hard\" over the summer to prepare for the new campaign.",
      "Obi has been prolific in academy fixtures throughout his teenage years and he is an outstanding prospect for the future. The 17-year-old was signed from Arsenal's academy for a small compensation fee and his transfer to United was described by a source as a \"significant coup\" last summer.",
      "United have signed Heaven and Obi from Arsenal for a pittance and both of those players could become important first-team regulars, so the club deserve praise for arranging their arrivals.",
      "The transfer of Obi seemed to particularly annoy Arsenal supporters, but he is only at the beginning of his career, and those fans will be irked again if he reaches the heights that are expected.",
      "United have taken flak for their abysmal transfer record in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but perhaps the tide is turning and signings like Heaven and Obi are the blueprint for a successful future."

      "In addition to signing Cunha and attempting to lure Mbeumo, who is believed to be valued at around £60m, to Old Trafford, United also have aspirations of signing a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper. The addition of a specialist right wing-back has also not been ruled out.",
      "If United are to achieve all of their objectives before the end of the summer, they are going to have to try and oversee plenty of outgoings. Although United are prepared to sell any player this summer, some are more likely to move on than others.",
      "The trio, who all spent time away from Old Trafford on loan in 2024/25, are surplus to requirements and head coach Ruben Amorim has no plans to reintegrate them into his squad.",
      "In truth, it is hard to see where they would fit into in his plans given his 3-4-2-1 system does not feature roles for natural wingers. In Amorim's system, width is provided by the wing-backs.",
      "With that in mind, it makes perfect sense for United to cash-in on them amid chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about the club prioritising the benefit of the team over finances when making a decision on any outgoings.",
      "\"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment,\" said Berrada, speaking in March.",

      "Napoli had a £40m bid rejected for the 20-year-old in January and it remains to be seen if they will submit a fresh offer. United are set to hold out for a higher fee this summer.",
      "Like Rashford, Sancho and Antony, selling him would make sense given United now operate with a winger-less system.

      "After scoring a respectable 12 Premier League goals for relegated Ipswich Town, Delap attracted interest from a handful of clubs. However, it was Chelsea's project that appealed to him most and he recently made the switch to Stamford Bridge.",

      "Among them are Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, Napoli ace Victor Osimhen and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David, who will leave Lille at the end of this month after five years at the French club.",
      "Each of them rank among the best strikers that are set to be attainable this summer, but who United could end up with come the end of the transfer window remains anybody's guess.",
      "The club is currently focusing on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, meaning incomings could slow until United oversee some outgoings. It is no secret that player sales will dictate what else United may be capable of this summer.",
      "However, one way or another, United must sign a proven goalscorer before the window closes on September 1.",
      "With a proven goalscorer required, United know they are going to have to loosen their purse strings. Established goalscorers are expensive and everyone wants one.",
      "Over the last few years, few strikers have been as consistent in front of goal as Osimhen. The Nigeria international, who Napoli are actively looking to sell this summer, has scored 85 goals over the last three seasons, including 37 goals out on loan at Galatasaray in 2024/25.",
      "Osimhen would be an excellent signing for United. He has a proven record in front of goal, is entering his prime at the age of 26 and he has already admitted he would love to play in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think playing in one of the top five leagues in the world (Serie A) is an amazing feeling for me,\" Osimhen said, speaking back in March 2023.",
      "\"A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and the strongest league but now I'm in one of the best leagues in the world which is the Italian Serie A.",
      "\"I'm working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday but, like I said, it's a process and I just want to keep on this momentum and continue to do well.\"",
      "Although it has not deterred Matheus Cunha from joining United and Mbeumo wanting to join him at Old Trafford, a lack of European football next season could hinder United's chances of attracting Osimhen. He has not gone a season without playing in Europe since 2018/19.",
      "Recently the subject of interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, Osimhen is also likely to command big wages and that could be an issue.",
      "But what United do have is a crop of big-name players they want to sell, including Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine has been informed he can leave if United receive an acceptable offer.",
      "United rejected a £40m bid from Napoli for the 20-year-old in January and are expected to hold out for a higher fee this summer. Somewhere in the region of £50m-£60m would reflect a fair market value for the Argentine based on his potential.",
      "Admired by Napoli and head coach Antonio Conte, it remains to be seen if the Serie A champions will make a fresh approach for Garnacho this summer. If they have retained their interest and show a strong desire to take him to Naples, Osimhen might creep into United's thoughts when negotiating.",
      "Signing a striker of Osimhen's ilk and offloading Garnacho would be a win-win situation for everyone concerned."

Paul Scholes was quick to share his feelings on who United should sign in the summer after his message to Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze following the England friendly this week.",

      "Meanwhile, the race for Viktor Gyokeres took another turn this week as Sporting declared that they had not promised their striker that he could leave at a reduced rate this summer. A new, higher fee for the Swede could make his signature a difficult one to tie down but if his heart is set on a move, the Lisbon club may have to let him go.",
      "Keep across all the Manchester United transfer updates in our live blog below...",
      "As the unfolding drama between Gyokeres and Sporting intensifies, the Lisbon club's president Frederico Varandas has promised the striker that things will only get worse before they get better.",
      "He explained on Wednesday:",
      "You should know me better by now. Threats, blackmail, insults, they don’t work with me. And I can guarantee one thing, Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60 plus 10.

      "Following the capture of Matheus Cunha and their ongoing pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United's attack is set to have a very different look to it next season.",
      "United secured the services of Cunha on the opening day of the summer transfer window after triggering his £62.5million release clause and have now set their sights on trying to land Brentford star Mbeumo, who is keen on sealing a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United had an opening offer for the Cameroonian turned down last week, understood to be worth £55m, but talks between the two clubs have remained ongoing and an improved is expected to be made once the transfer window reopens next week.",
      "If the Reds extract Mbeumo from the Gtech Community Stadium, they will inherit a player who scored 20 goals in the 2024/25 Premier League campaign. Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of a 17-goal season.",
      "With that said, both would occupy starting berths in M16, immediately forcing their way into Ruben Amorim's first-choice XI. Cunha is expected to operate from the left-sided No.10 role and Mbeumo from the right.",
      "The latter predominantly plays as a right-winger at Brentford but often drifts inside, taking up central positions. His versatility means that he should easily adapt to operating in one of the two playmaker roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "As a result of Cunha and Mbeumo potentially occupying those two positions, Bruno Fernandes and Amad, who often operated as the two No.10s in 2024/25, would have to be deployed elsewhere. Fortunately, both players are versatile enough to operate from different areas of the pitch.",
      "Fernandes is comfortable operating as a No.8 and Amad is equally effective as a right wing-back. And if Fernandes is tasked with making the centre of midfield his permanent residence, he would be only too happy to do so, admitting just over a year ago that he imagined himself operating from a deeper position as his career progressed.",
      "\"In terms of passing, game organisation, defence, tactics,\" Fernandes said, speaking in March 2024. \"I have a little thought in my head that I'm going to end my career further back, because everyone who started there and went to No.10 ended up retreating on the field at the end.",
      "\"It's a position I like, playing deeper, facing the game more. With the ball, it makes my game a lot easier because I have a broader view of the game and it is ideal for what we've talked about with the last pass, which can sometimes come from deeper on the pitch.\"",
      "Fernandes proved on countless occasions in 2024/25, particularly this side of Christmas, that he is a more than capable operator from the centre of midfield. He enjoyed an excellent run of form between late-January and the March international break, scoring nine times.",
      "If Fernandes is tasked with making one of the two No.8 positions his long-term role, United will have to ensure they find him a suitable midfield partner to compliment his qualities. Manuel Ugarte blew hot and cold in his first season at the club and doubts have been raised about his ability on the ball.",
      "In addition to wanting Mbeumo and a striker, United also remain keen to sign a new midfielder. However, outgoings will dictate what it possible over the course of the summer."

      "If United successfully add Mbeumo to their attack, it would mark a second statement signing of the summer following the addition of Cunha on June 1. He arrived in Manchester after United triggered his £62.5m release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "With United set to focus on attempting to wrap up the signing of Mbeumo once the window reopens next week, they will then have to switch their focus to outgoings to fund further additions. United want to strengthen a handful of other areas ahead of next season.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what United's strongest matchday squad could look like come the end of the window.",
      "Despite wanting a new goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, the Cameroonian is still likely to retain top spot in the pecking order and start next season as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir is likely to leave and Amorim will want an upgrade on him to provide competition for Onana.",
      "As far as the back-three is concerned, Amorim, once everyone is fit, will be spoilt for choice. United are well-stocked at centre-back and every member of that department will believe they are worthy of starting, meaning pre-season performances could dictate who gets the nod in August.",
      "Currently, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, who both have bright futures ahead of them, are the most likely options to start in the two wide centre-back roles, meaning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt will compete to start in between them.",
      "If United sign Mbeumo, Amad is an obvious pick at right wing-back. The Ivorian was a rare bright spark in 2024/25 and should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "In the opposite wing-back berth, Patrick Dorgu is currently a shoo-in after arriving from Lecce earlier this year. He will only get better with time and games.",
      "In the centre of midfield, Bruno Fernandes is an obvious starter. He is highly likely to occupy one of the two No.8 positions amid Cunha's arrival and the expectation he will operate from the left-sided No.10 position.",
      "However, there is an element of uncertainty surrounding who could occupy the midfield spot next to him. United want to sign a new midfielder this summer, but they are yet to have identified a firm target, with outgoings set to determine how big a budget they have.",
      "As things stand, Manuel Ugarte is the most obvious candidate to operate next to Fernandes. He will be able to do the dirty side of the game, allowing the United skipper to advance into forward areas.",
      "As far as the two No.10 positions are concerned, they should be occupied by Mbeumo and Cunha. The latter is a specialist in his role and Mbeumo has the versatility to adapt having predominantly played as a right-winger at Brentford.",
      "The biggest void in need of filling in United's starting XI, of course, is at No.9. They are desperate for a striker and have been forced to alter their plans after missing out on Liam Delap.",
      "Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres would be the dream signing for most United supporters amid his outstanding goalscoring record in Portugal and his relationship with Amorim. He ticks several boxes and would bring a proven goalscoring record to Old Trafford.",
      "However, United's chances of signing him will once again rest on outgoings and generating funds via sales. United do have a collection of players they want to move on.",
      "With United targeting a new goalkeeper to compete with Onana, they could do worse than targeting Leicester City shot-stopper Mads Hermansen following their relegation to the Championship. Their financial difficulties could mean they may have to sanction a cut-price deal.",
      "Defensive cover could be provided by Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and one of Maguire or De Ligt. United are also reasonably well-stocked in midfield, meaning cover could come from Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi could offer attacking cover. Rasmus Hojlund would be an option for the bench if retained.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha, Gyokeres.",

      "Garnacho does not directly fit into United head coach Ruben Amorim's winger-less system. The attacker also questioned the United boss for starting him on the bench for last month's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",
      "With an exit highly likely this summer, it remains to be seen if Napoli will resurrect their interest in his signature. If they do, they are unlikely to get involved in long, drawn-out negotiations, with Manna admitting earlier this year they would want to do a deal on their own terms.",
      "\"We are making some assessments, he is an important player, but he is not ours,\" Manna said, speaking back in January.",
      "\"We must not get carried away even if we know that an important player has left, a top player as the manager defined him and therefore the expectations are high. But we will do something on Napoli's terms.\"",
      "Napoli have since won the Serie A title and are on the brink of signing outgoing Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne. He has arrived in Naples to undergo a medical ahead of joining the club on a free transfer.",
      "By bringing in a player of De Bruyne's calibre, it shows Napoli are not in the mood to mess around this summer and want to attract some of the biggest names in the business. Furthermore, they have not recruited an alternative winger since attempting to sign Garnacho earlier this year.",
      "With United open to selling at the right price and Napoli no doubt planning to strengthen their ranks with the ambition of retaining their Serie A crown next season, it will be interesting to see what they potentially deem a reasonable price for a player of Garnacho's quality and potential."

      "Sporting had yet to comment on the situation, but Varandas has now broken his silence during a press conference at a museum in Leiria. \"One thing is that you should already know me better,\" he said. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",

      "Varandas also explained the gentleman's agreement with Gyokeres, further explaining: \"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the season, especially because he was going to be 27.",

      "\"The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\""

While the same happened to Alejandro Garnacho prior to the Manchester derby, Rashford would not play another minute for United before his loan exit to Aston Villa.",
      "In the West Midlands, Rashford began to show signs of the player many know he can be, but his redemption arc was cut short when he picked up a season-ending injury. MEN Sport understands that while Villa agreed a £40m option to buy with United earlier this year, they do not hold first refusal on Rashford.",

      "He has been sharing his progress on social media and, on Wednesday evening, appeared to give his biggest transfer signal yet to Barcelona and other suitors that he is ready to return. Sharing a video of himself doing a 'high knees' exercise, Rashford captioned the clip: \"Feeling good again,\" accompanied with a broad smile emoji.",
      "Proving his fitness will be key for Rashford if he is to make a move this summer. Barcelona, or any other club for that matter, will not sanction a medical until the winger is at full fitness again.",

      "United will play three games in the US, facing West Ham United, Everton and Bournemouth as part of the Premier League Summer Series. After returning to home soil, they will wrap up their pre-season schedule with a clash against Fiorentina at Old Trafford.",
      "This will mark the third summer in a row that United have jetted off to the US for their pre-season tour. On the previous two, with the exception of just one game, United have been starved of an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in August 2023 after United had returned from the US and he got injured in the opening game of last summer's pre-season tour, meaning he has not had a full pre-season since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He will desperately be hoping it is third time lucky for him this summer, although Inter Milan's interest in his signature could see him shipped out of Old Trafford before United board their flight to the US in the fourth week of July.",
      "With United prepared to sell any player this summer, they are unlikely to stand in the 22-year-old's way if an enticing offer is presented to them. He scored just ten goals in 2024/25 and patience with him is wearing increasingly thin.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, it is no secret by now that United are desperate to sign a striker. However, after missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction that search will head in.",
      "They continue to be linked with the likes of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen of Napoli, with both seemingly destined to move this summer, but no formal offers for a striker have yet been tabled by the Reds, with their focus currently on trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United have already strengthened their attack by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, and Mbeumo is likely to command a similar fee, but ending the summer without recruiting an out-and-out No.9 can't be an option.",
      "The transfer window will temporarily close at 7pm this evening (Tuesday), but will reopen again as soon as next Monday.",
      "Once the window reopens, United need to try and step up their efforts in the seller's market. They want exits to reach double figures this summer and they have a crop of players within their ranks they want to sell who could bring in useful fees.",
      "United have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales, while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave. Selling any player is an easier-said-than-done task, of course, but if United were to successfully offload the aforementioned quartet, they would be looking to bank over £100m.",
      "That would give them a huge boost in their quest to sign a striker. Gyokeres is set to cost north of £60m and he is currently looking as though he could be the most likely candidate to strengthen Ruben Amorim's front line.",
      "Whether it be Gyokeres or an alternative centre-forward, it would be ideal if United could get a deal wrapped up in time to take their new chief goalscorer on the pre-season tour. That adaptation period can be so crucial for players ahead of the competitive action kicking off in August.",
      "Getting a new striker in ahead of the season starting would give Amorim the opportunity to see how he bonds and forms on-field relationships with his new teammates. United were playing catch-up in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee did not go on last summer's pre-season tour after being granted a period of leave following his participation at Euro 2024 with the Netherlands.",
      "With the Club World Cup taking place over the coming weeks, the summer break is bound to feel as though it is going that little bit quicker. It means the clock is ticking for United to secure their most important jigsaw piece."

      "However, United made the decision to pay £64million for his signature. The package could still rise to £72m.",
      "United, who had been interested in Harry Kane earlier in the window, were in desperate need of a striker and their search eventually led them to Hojlund. However, they bought potential rather than a finished product.",

      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Heading into the 2024/25 campaign, Onana‘s position at Man Utd was pretty secure as he grew into his debut season at Old Trafford after replacing David De Gea.",
      "However, Onana’s situation has drastically changed over the past year as his performances declined during the 24/25 season as he made several unforgivable mistakes.",
      "This summer is vital for Man Utd as they need to build a squad equipped to thrive under Ruben Amorim in his 3-4-3 formation and their priority has been to strengthen in forward positions.",
      "The Red Devils have already signed Matheus Cunha and he is expected to be joined by Bryan Mbuemo while they remain in the market for a new striker.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye Isak alternative, City to spoil Arsenal plan",
      "Reports in recent months have also indicated that they are looking for a goalkeeper, as Onana didn’t do nearly enough under Amorim to justify retaining his No.1 position heading into next season.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with several potential targets and a report from Ben Jacobs for GiveMeSport claims two goalkeepers are on their radar amid an ‘open situation’.",
      "Nice’s Marcin Bułka is ‘one name on United’s list’, while Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez is also ‘on their radar’, as they ‘determine whether to go for a number one’.",
      "Jacobs also claims Man Utd have ‘entered talks’ for Bulka, but they cannot sign him during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The report notes that ‘United and Nice are still banned from doing summer business until September after the latter was placed in a blind trust, allowing both clubs to compete in the Europa League in 2024/25’ as they avoided a breach of UEFA’s multi-club ownership rules amid Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s involvement.",
      "Therefore, ‘should a deal progress, United will attempt to agree on something for January 2026, or even wait until Bulka becomes a free agent next summer’.",
      "Bulka’s current contract is due to expire in June 2026, with ‘the Red Devils and additional suitors sniffing an opportunity to pounce for a cut-price fee when the transfer window reopens on June 16’.",
      "Regarding Onana and Martinez, the report adds:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.",
      "‘GMS sources recently revealed that Aston Villa fan favourite Emiliano Martinez has been on the Red Devils’ radar, alongside La Liga heavyweights Atletico Madrid, and the World Cup winner’s preference is thought to be to stay in Europe even though he has options to embark on a fresh challenge in Saudi Arabia.’",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to bring in a new goalkeeper over the summer with the Red Devils turning their attention to a Poland international.",

      "18) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Manchester United\nOsimhen apparently fancies a move to Old Trafford, presumably because he’s seen the salaries United have been dishing out in recent years. Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",

Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered.

      "One Man Utd fan is more than happy for Liverpool to spend a fortune on Florian Wirtz in a Juan Sebastian Veron and Faustino Asprilla-flavoured gamble.",
      "Send your thoughts to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "Florian Asprilla or Faustino Wirtz?\nHi guys",
      "I think Niall makes some valid points. The only caveat I have is that Arne just won the league with a squad 99% created by Jurgen Klopp. I’m therefore confident that he’ll get it right with the players he wants to add to the squad.",
      "That said, the injury to Bajetic, who I thought might be Gravenberch’s understudy this season, highlights what Niall is saying that we should perhaps be prioritising other positions. If Grav is injured, does that mean our midfield is Mac, Szobo and Wirtz? And do we then bench Frimpong, and play Bradley as the much more defensive right back?",
      "If Kevin Keegan was our manager, I’d be emailing calling the Wirtz deal our Faustino Asprilla moment. As it is, in Arne we trust (but if he changes his mind, we trust then also).\nMichael, LFC, in Hackney",
      "",
      "There was an interesting take from Niall about whether we should be splashing out on Wirtz. Then noticed Football365 already (jokingly?) heating up the Wirtz Vs Cherki debate before its even started with the 10 transfers article.",
      "All this during times when one the one hand its very exciting to be linked with a mega-money signing but there is also the worry about what happens if it all falls through…the worst possible thing… being mocked by rival fans.",
      "I remember well the mocking and jeers at Caicedo chose Chelsea over us.  At the time it was a bit depressing. Going to be honest not that sad about it now though.",
      "I was kind of with Niall that maybe its too much and we shouldn’t be offering so much for one player, but then remembered that was exactly how I felt about Van Dijk, He was too expensive and we had embarrassed ourselves. That worked out pretty well. So I reckon we trust the Liverpool system now and realise they probably know what they are doing. They definitely know more than me about what is worth spending the money on.",
      "Anyway making a team of Dan’s was way trickier than I thought it would be. I realised that Dani Pacheco is 34 now and his breakthrough season is coming.",
      "GK Danny Ward\nRB Danny Alves\nCB Dan Burn\nCB Danilo Luiz da Silva\nLB Danny Rose",
      "CM Danny Murphy against Man united or Daniele De Rossi otherwise\nAM Dani Pacheco\nLW Dani Olmo\nRW Dan James",
      "ST Daniel Sturridge",
      "Don’t think its beating many teams sadly.",
      "Some Subs: Daniel Agger, Dani Carvajal, Danilo(Other one), Danny Mills, Dani Ceballos, Danny Ings, Danny Welbeck\nDan T",
      "",
      "Interesting to see Niall, Annapolis’ take on Liverpool’s move for Florian Wirtz this morning. I’m a United fan so I always have to parse my views on the Scousers’ business and avoid the “hope this goes to shit” lens that can distort my takes.",
      "But even when (I think) I manage to do that, I don’t see this as anything other than an odd departure from Liverpool’s normal modus operandi. The Frimpong and Kerkez deals make perfect sense – signing sorted early in the window, decent value obtained, lots of potential upside and limited exposure.",
      "But paying over £110m for one player, who maybe needs to be accommodated in a number 10 role which hasn’t been an orthodox part of Liverpool’s system for the past decade, looks laden with risk. Maybe this is the beginning of Slot shifting from Klopp’s system having had the good sense to not tear everything up when he first arrived. Maybe the balance between midfield and attack can be tweaked and refined. I wouldn’t assume to know the nuances of top level football well enough to categorically state one or the other.",
      "But in the interests of speculating, it does feel a bit Veron-to-United, or maybe Asprilla-to-Newcastle. A high profile, high quality player being added while in a position of strength, but maybe an unnecessary move that creates a selection issue rather than complementing the existing squad.",
      "To my eyes, that money would be better spent on a striker who gets closer to Firmino’s old levels than Nunez has since he joined.",
      "I could obviously be proven spectacularly wrong. Wirtz might be the centrepiece of a grand plan and maybe they build successfully around him. But as a fan of what should be a rival club, I’m okay-ish with Liverpool planning to spend such a high % of their transfer funds on him. To put it in terms that fans of the other big teams might relate to: I’d feel infinitely more concerned if they were dangling that £110m+ in front of Newcastle and going heavy to get Isak.\nKeith Reilly",
      "",
      "Am I missing something?\nAt the bottom of many of the pages I read on this very fine website a poll is running, ‘Who will win the 2025/26 Premier League title?’ and the current results are shocking, they may have changed but at the time of writing it is as below:",
      "Liverpool – 45%\nArsenal – 21%\nMan City – 14%\nChelsea 5%\nNewcastle – 5%\nOther – 11%",
      "I’m just going to rank these in the order I think the top 4 teams will actually finish next season:",
      "1st. Man City – 14% – Huh?",
      "How has Man City fallen this far in the eyes of the “informed” football public? This is a team that has won 6 out of the last 8 seasons, a team that has beaten record after record consistently since Pep took over, a team that had a manager who had quite a few personal problems to deal with this season and still finish 3rd after a meltdown and missing their best player, the lynch pin of the squad, being out for most of the season.",
      "They started rebuilding in January and have just added more quality players, a lot of people forget how this team was built, to solve problems this City team just spends £50 million on a player, if it doesn’t work out, they buy another £50 million player in the same position, rinse and repeat, look at the saga of left back till Kyle Walker signed. They have been keeping their hand in their pocket for the last couple of seasons (probably due to a 115 reasons) but don’t get this team wrong, they are willing to spend and spend big to get back on their perch.",
      "FFP means nothing to them until a punishment is given and by cementing themselves as too big to fail, the FA are more than likely to just roll over, charge them £100 million and dock them 40 points, they finish 8th – 6th on 60 points that season and then go back to winning ways getting another 3 titles until Pep buggers off and then the clone of Alex Ferguson takes over just to take the piss.",
      "How quick people forget, barring Rodri suffering from PTSD due to his injury, this team will win the title next season, just look at the team. Erling will put his other scoring boots on and get the golden boot by December (its weird that a striker who got 31 goals in 44 appearances is seen as a poor season but he is that good), Rodri is one of only 2 defensive players to win the Ballon d’Or in recent memory (last 20 years), Phil Foden is still quite talented, Cherki and Reijnders are coming, they have a shed load of underage talent (not in the Epstein way) and Ederson is Ederson and always will be Ederson. They’ve even got Oscar Bobb, who you’ve never heard of but he has one premier league medal more than you.",
      "This is Man Cities title to lose, the also rans will just have to wait till Pep goes through another divorce or for FFP to give a points deduction, which ever comes first.",
      "2nd. Liverpool – 45% – Wait, what?",
      "At the start of this season Liverpool people thought we were lucky to make it into the top four, let alone win the thing with 4 games to go. I think Liverpool were criminally underrated due to the unknown of Arnie Slot, the season before they had been trying to get the quady for Klopp and were very close (they still had a chance until the 17/03), the change of manager was the only major thing and for the first half of this season no team could touch them, Liverpool went from a team that was on default tactics on Pro Evo to the dick who spends 40 minutes setting up their team while everyone else sits around getting drunk.",
      "They were more fun under Klopp but they are now scarier, Klopps team were headstrong running though walls, if the wall didn’t go down they would still run until they knocked themselves out, Slots team has learnt to move around the wall, apart from the PSG match which they lost but were incredible in, this team always looked like it could go to another level in a match but usually won without having to do it.",
      "The transfers of Frimpong, Kerkez and Wirtz are statement signings, showing intent to be the next era of football, beating all in their path, sadly, like Klopps team when we bought Allison and Van Dyke, they are coming up against a juggernaut called Man City. A striker will help and Liverpool will push City all the way to the end but they will not beat them, this season wasn’t the start of Man Cities downfall, it was just a blip that happened under extraordinary bad luck, luck they have paid a lot of money to change.",
      "I understand recency bias but nearly half the people who visit this website think Liverpool will win next season, I find that insane, we might be making the right noises but you can’t forget the past, it always bloody repeats itself.",
      "3rd. Arsenal – 21% – Ha!",
      "I don’t want to troll Arsenal fans, some of my best friends are Arsenal fans but 21% HA. This team is youngish, has unbelievable talent and can beat anyone on their day, they have an attack that a Saudi team would pay a billion for and a defence that would get £750 million, they have a lot more strength than a “usual” Arsenal team and have the options to bully or out pass a lot of teams, on football manager this is the team you would want as it’d take a few shrewd signings and some really good half time team talks to be a treble winner.",
      "The problem I’ve found with this Arsenal team is the sense of entitlement, the manager and a vocal minority of the fan base, seem to have, they both have an excuse for every situation and seem to think that they deserve to win it just because they played well for 3 seasons. “If it wasn’t for a red card”, “If we hadn’t had injuries”, “If the wind had blown in a different direction”, “if the season had started at christmas…”, its just excuse after excuse.",
      "When Liverpool were always the bridesmaid they didn’t complain anywhere near the amount as some of these youtube, voice of the fan, cockgobblers and Klopp didn’t whine as much as Arteta does, he’s a sexy man with a sexy wife with a sexy life, why does he always look like someone has pissed on his chips. (Might try and turn that last line into a song)",
      "This unearned arrogance seems to have seeped into the mentality of the team, the strops the players have from time to time are apparent, a card goes against them, a VAR decision is DEFINITELY wrong or a tackle was a bit hard and they down tools, wanting to take the ball home because the beautiful game has been marred because its not the Arsenal way.",
      "If this team got a new manager (hopefully Arteta just moves on when they come third next season so the board don’t look like bad guys when they fire him) they could go from strength to strength, if he hadn’t of managed Tottenham Ange would of been great as long as he wasn’t allowed near the tactics, his infectious personality and will to win while also admitting when they are shit was a breath of fresh air and if it had been at Arsenal you could see a completely different player mentality.",
      "Another reason for my reaction is that they haven’t won anything, don’t bring up that bloody FA Cup, they are always near but in the final part of a season/cup they just fall away because they thought they’d already won it, this season would of been hilarious if Man City had got up to second, another “How does Arsenal come 3rd in a 2 horse race?” would of turned them into the new Spurs and who wouldn’t want Arsenal to turn into the new Spurs.",
      "4th.  Aston Villa – 0% (or 11% with other) – Why not?",
      "Its not about Aston Villa being better, its about Aston Villa having less intense games to deal with, the Europa Cup, while fun, isn’t anywhere near as taxing as Champs League, Newcastle are still paper thin having a lot of the same back up players they had in the championship, Chelsea are still young and while they could become amazing, I can also see this becoming the norm around European match time, resting players for the wednesday, losing, playing on the wednesday, losing and then because the teams knackered they lose on the following Saturday, having 3 loses in a row which is a heavy hit to the mentality of a young team.",
      "Man United are still rebuilding from the last rebuild, Tottenham are Tottenham and will forever be Tottenham, Forest may make an upset but its a long season, they will more than likely do what they did this season and sadly fall away. Brighton could get in there, they have a great squad which is constantly being pillaged by the bigger boys, if they can keep them this season and not having any European football its on the card (what a weird sentence, Brighton being a top four team)",
      "Aston Villa has become a team to be reckoned with, we’ve seen what they can do with a competent manager and a team of battle hardened machines that know what they need to do, add a bit of flair into this team and this is a no brainer.",

      "Spurs’ injury crisis\nHi there,",
      "I don’t have a dog in the fight over whether or not Ange should have been sacked, nor do I care a whit whether or not Spurs or Arsenal have had a more successful season, but I’m not sure that O Clark gets to use Spurs’ defensive injury crisis as an argument in defence of Postecoglu.",
      "There’s a fairly solid evidence base that he bears some culpability for the repeated and identical injuries that their defenders have suffered, not merely in terms of the high line system that they play, but also in terms of his somewhat antediluvian training methods.",
      "And that’s not even talking about how common it is for players to break down immediately on return from injury, which leads one to believe that he may be rushing them back too early from their rehabilitation.",
      "I accept that a central defensive partnership of Archie Gray and Ben Davies is sub-optimal, but the fact that Gray and Davies are the only central defenders available to Postecoglu might be cause for condemnation rather than exoneration.\nDara O’Reilly, London",

      "Look and Mourinho and Guardiola – they both took the league cup seriously (and won it the season they first won the league) because they wanted to instill a culture of winning trophies. Winning a cup (even a lesser one) is a big part of building a dominant team that is able to handle those biggest games.",
      "If Arteta had won a trophy this season people wouldn’t suddenly say he was doing a good job (he is already, let’s be honest), but as a Liverpool fan I’d be very nervous that this Arsenal team had managed to get over that hurdle. Until that point, there will always be a question over the team taking that final step.\nTom, Andover",
      "",
      "Ange was a good coach.",
      "Winning cup trophies is not equal to league success or exhibit superiority over better teams that would usually  beat cup winners in the league(see crystal palace vs city, arsenal vs city in the FA cup), however it does show the ability of the inferior team to beat opposition despite the clear disparity in terms of football skills  and the potential to improve-building from their win.",
      "Cup wins signify success. Tottenham won the Europa cup. Spurs were successful.",
      "Football shall not remember arsenal finishing 2nd for the 3rd time rather it will tell the tale of the Australian guy who won that European cup and the victory by spurs over a supposedly bigger opponent. Cup wins are indeed a measure of a teams’ success even while experiencing failure at the league level.",
      "Ange was a realist. He accepted the situation he was in, where the odds were stacked against him-the players ability (Son was the only world class talent), consistency, cohesion and motivation to win games,support from management was highly depleted-eventually leading him to the transparent conclusion that a league triumph was impossible but the euro cup was achievable. This gamble was made despite the consequences of league defeats to inferior opposition while playing with an (apparently) uninspiring style of football but the cup win was worth it(you could see the happiness of spurs fans despite enduring a bad league season and the subsequent drama in football it brought, like arsenal assuming the mantle of the ‘spursy’ team of the season).",

      "“It is simple. To do something, we need to sell players.”",
      "Ruben Amorim there, acknowledging publicly in February what he must have been saying behind closed doors for three months prior to that. Since then, his resolve to make major changes at Old Trafford can only have strengthened in the wake of United’s worst season in living memory, their wretched failures making it more imperative that the Red Devils finally learn how to sell.",
      "Amorim has commenced his rebuild, paying £62million to get Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Man Utd will probably spend a similar sum on Bryan Mbeumo. Given the chance, Amorim might drop the same again on Viktor Gyokeres. All of which will make Man Utd a lot more fun to watch. But vibes won’t pay their bills.",
      "The club’s financial situation is perhaps not as perilous as Sir Jim Ratcliffe might want us to believe while Man Utd go through another round of layoffs. It was thought that Amorim might have just shy of £100million to spend in the summer market before he had to raise funds through sales. Any two of the three aforementioned forwards would take Man Utd well over that budget.",
      "So it’s time to sell, sell, sell. Something they are notoriously bad at. And the early signs suggest they are yet to catch on.",
      "The Telegraph gave an insight into United’s sales strategy only last month. Apparently, the Red Devils believed they could rake in £90million by selling Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "At best, that was wishful thinking. At worst, another sign of the delusion and incompetence that has made Man Utd one of the biggest patsies in the European game.",
      "United’s best hope with Sancho was they were dealing with Chelsea. If the Blues won’t do that deal, who will? Who is going to pay serious money for a barely-arsed big name, one with another year left on a massive contract who everyone knows Man Utd want shot of?",
      "It is a similar story with Rashford. An unwanted, disinterested player on a huge salary. Any club tempted to give the England forward a fresh start would be daft to offer Man Utd anything more than the loan-first deal Villa initially agreed to then refused to follow through on.",
      "Antony might be a more straightforward sale. Yes, at a price to shame United’s recruiters again but and even while offering a £60million hit, there is hardly a clamour, despite the Brazilian showing some signs of life at Real Betis.",
      "Rather than bank £90million to put towards a rebuild, more likely is that two, maybe all three, will once more be loaned out, only after they have sulked around Carrington for some or much of pre-season, before Man Utd accept liability for significant portions of their salary.",
      "That reality appears to have dawned on Man Utd if there’s any truth in the report that they have sought to fill some of that black hole by increasing their asking price for one of their more sellable assets.",
      "However, we can only assume whomever forecasted a £90million deposit for their loan exiles also priced Alejandro Garnacho at £70million. Because that’s an equally nonsensical figure.",
      "Garnacho is no more wanted than Sancho, Rashford, Antony. Less so, perhaps, given Amorim is more familiar with his flaws than the others’. And any club who might take a chance on the Argentina international knows it.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Garnacho was told by Amorim during the Bilbao inquest. And, sure, it will serve the player to be elsewhere next season. But Man Utd ought to be the party dropping to their knees. Without divine intervention, they have no hope of raking in £70million for the maddeningly-inconsistent winger.",
      "Chelsea and Arsenal have both been linked with Garnacho, but both have cheaper, arguably better alternatives. Napoli, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all interested, are they? Not at that price, not while United’s desire to be rid of Garnacho is so well documented.",
      "To furnish Amorim with the bare minimum he needs to jumpstart the Man Utd juggernaut on the road to credibility, the Red Devils must at least double the £100million they started with. Selling the four-man bomb squad is unlikely to achieve that, let alone rake in the £160million they anticipated.",
      "Who else could Man Utd take to market? Bruno Fernandes scuppered whatever plans the club may have had to cash in on their captain. Many Man Utd fans, including Gary Neville, would be loathe to see Kobbie Mainoo sold to the highest bidder but the homegrown midfielder is one of few others over whom Man Utd could negotiate from a position of authority.",
      "For the vast majority of Amorim’s squad, certainly those he wants rid of, it is a buyer’s market. And before long, a borrower’s one.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has informed his agent that he doesn’t want to sign for any other club this summer apart from Barcelona.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man Utd and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "Man Utd legend Cristiano Ronaldo ‘demanded’ that Al-Nassr signed Alejandro Garnacho this summer during his contract negotiations, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer."

      "It’s unclear whether this has altered Arsenal’s stance on their preferred striker signing, but a report from Portuguese journalist Nuno Farinha on Wednesday claimed they are ‘very advanced’ in talks to sign Gyokeres and a new ‘meeting’ has taken place as the two sides look to thrash out a deal.",

      "“No formal proposal has arrived at Sporting. This time it seems that there will be, because things with Arsenal are already very advanced and it seems to me that there is a great desire to speed up this process. That is why a meeting is taking place at this moment.",
      "“I believe it is in London, which is why I mentioned the issue of British punctuality. Basically, what is important from now on is to understand how this meeting went and how Arsenal will prepare for what we already know is Sporting’s position. €60m plus €10m is out of the question.”",

      "It remains to be seen whether this will impact Man Utd’s hopes of landing Gyokeres, but Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on their move for the forward.",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists that Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is not “the guy” to score goals for the Red Devils next season.",
      "It was thought that Gyokeres would not entertain the idea of leaving Sporting for Man Utd in the summer after Ruben Amorim’s side failed to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "But journalist Ben Jacobs revealed that the Sweden international would actually be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, regardless of them not being in Europe next term.",
      "Before transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Tuesday and claimed that Man Utd “called again” about Gyokeres as they keep “informed” on his situation.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "Some Man Utd fans have been excited at the prospect of Gyokeres leading the line next season but club legend Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils should avoid the signing.",
      "Ferdinand was joined on his YouTube channel by host Joel Beya and former Man City defender Joleon Lescott as they discussed Gyokeres’ potential transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Beya declared: “Gyokeres, you’ve got to go for him.” To which Lescott swiftly said: “I believe that you’re going to go for him – but he’s not the guy.”",
      "Ferdinand replied: “I don’t think he’s the guy. I’ve not watched him loads [but] I’ve watched him probably three times really, really closely.",
      "“And three times I’ve gone, ‘He ain’t getting that opportunity in the Prem’. When I see him physically matched, what else is there?",
      "“Is there enough – after he’s physically matched – to get him a goal?”",
      "Lescott added: “You don’t get away with that in the Prem.”",
      "A report on Tuesday in Portugal insisted that Gyokeres is ‘furious’ after Sporting apparently broke a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to sell him for €70m (£59m) in the summer.",
      "It had reportedly been ‘agreed’ that his €100m would ‘not be an obstacle’ for a summer transfer and that Gyokeres ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "But Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has rejected those claims and insisted that Gyokeres “will not leave” for €70m this summer.",
      "Varandas said: “I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres – neither today nor last season.”",
      "The Sporting president added: “One of the agent’s biggest concerns was whether we would demand the termination clause.",
      "“He wanted to guarantee certain things. And what was agreed? That Sporting would not demand a release clause now.",
      "“For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100m eurors or 90m euros.",
      "“In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: ‘It’s not worth us setting a value because I don’t know what will happen in a year’s time. I don’t know if it will be 40m euros, 60m euros or 80m euros. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million euros.”",

      "Whitwell told Stretford Paddock’s YouTube channel: “The first bid was £45m, plus £10m in add-ons… but I think Brentford want a fee more in line with what United paid for Cunha. They’ve looked at it and thought, this is what you’re paying for Cunha, Mbeumo also scores goals, so…",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "“So now we’re at a point where the clubs are deciding how much that is going to be. I think all the sides think that this will get done, but I don’t think it is imminent.",
      "“I don’t believe anything is going to happen today (Tuesday, before the mini summer deadline), but my personal view is that it will get done eventually.”",
      "When asked if there is anything incoming Tottenham boss Thomas Frank could do to turn Mbeumo’s head at this stage, Whitwell replied: “No, I don’t think so.",
      "“I’m sure the player will have known the likelihood of what that was (Frank leaving for Spurs), but that was trailed as something for quite a while and if the player really felt he wanted it, he could have gone there.”",
      "Picking out the reasons why Mbeumo has chosen Man Utd, Whitwell continued: “He has a clear vision and can see how he fits into the system at United.",
      "“The stature of the place – and I know people have been upset about him choosing Man Utd when there is no European football on offer.",
      "“But clearly, the raised profile you get from your own personal brand, let’s say, and also the opportunity to play in that stadium (Old Trafford), the pressure, the eyeballs that come with it, I think it (United) are still an appealing prospect to a lot of players.”",
      "Former CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs echoed a lot of what Whitwell had said when asked about a potential Tottenham hijack of the deal.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “Regarding the Spurs part in all of this. You can never say definitively that Thomas Frank won’t influence Tottenham’s transfer business.",
      "“My understanding is very clear as of now, Tottenham know Mbeumo’s preference is Manchester United, as do all other suitors.",
      "“Just because a new manager comes in, especially under Daniel Levy, it’s very unlikely they’ll turn around to Thomas Frank and say ‘is getting Mbeumo a deal breaker and can you hijack Manchester United’s plans.’",
      "“I’m not expecting Thomas Frank’s expected arrival at Tottenham to hugely influence the Mbeumo situation, the most important thing is that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United and if the clubs agree the fee, regardless of the Tottenham situation, Mbeumo will still pick Manchester United.”",

      "But the plundering of Brentford might not stop there as Frank has ‘demanded’ that Bryan Mbeumo accompany him on the trip to Spurs, who will have to hijack Man Utd’s move for the forward.",
      "It would not be the first time a manager has joined a bigger club and made sure one of his players joins him – although Spurs will hope it goes better than most of these examples.",
      "",
      "Marouane Fellaini\nDavid Moyes “never wanted Marouane Fellaini to be my first Man Utd signing”, but the subtext is hilarious and crucial.",
      "While he always intended to pack the Belgian among his belongings for the trip from Everton to Old Trafford, the manager was painfully aware of The Optics in using the rare transfer pull of one of the biggest clubs in world football to immediately bring in a relatively uncultured player from his old club.",
      "But Ed Woodward somehow contrived to deliver an even more embarrassing scenario in his first and worst transfer window at Man Utd. Fellaini was the only signing handed down to Moyes after futile pursuits of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Thiago Alcantara, Cesc Fabregas, Ander Herrera and Fabio Coentrao, among a great many others.",
      "“I knew, coming from my old club, the look of him was never going to be [right for United],” Moyes added. It undeniably contributed to the sheer incompetence of Man Utd signing Fellaini for £27.5m on September 3, despite there being a release clause in his contract making him £4m cheaper up to July 31.",
      "Not that Moyes’ concern over perception prevented the club from making a joint bid for Fellaini and Leighton Baines earlier that summer.",
      "The tales of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being shown tapes of Phil Jagielka are regrettably apocryphal but it is without doubt that a manager out of his depth clutched a comfort blanket that carried the scent of Goodison Park as his big career break ended in inevitable failure.",
      "Then again, as Sunderland manager a few years later Moyes openly said of Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj that he would “drive down to Manchester and pick them up” if a deal was possible, so the bloke obviously just values familiarity.",

      "Arouna Kone\nIt is remarkable that Moyes jumping up to Man Utd was not the most absurd case of overpromotion those circumstances produced. Rarely ever has a manager failed upwards quite so impressively as Roberto Martinez with Everton.",
      "The Spaniard arrived at Goodison Park as the Moyes replacement armed with an FA Cup winner’s medal, but the addition of a Premier League relegation on his CV suggested the arrangement might not end so well.",
      "A brilliant first season was the precursor to two years of expensive backwards steps, by which point Martinez was sacked and again ludicrously fell higher up the managerial ladder by being entrusted with the Golden Generations of both Belgium and Portugal.",
      "Martinez surely spent his first days in both posts investigating the genealogy of his old Wigan squad. His first signing at Everton was that of Kone, who described it as “an honour to be back working with the manager once again”.",

      "The pair had first crossed paths at Watford when Silva personally intervened to hijack the Brazilian’s planned move to Ajax. The Hornets sacked Silva five months later in a rare show of impatience with a manager, who landed at Everton by the summer.",

      "Joe Allen\n“We have got some protection on Brendan coming back for our players in the initial period, which I think is the right thing,” Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said of a gentleman’s agreement – or what he termed “a 12-month respite” – designed to prevent Liverpool from raiding the Welsh club for anything more than their manager.",
      "It lasted all of 70 days. While Rodgers reunited with former Swansea loanee Fabio Borini in his first signing as head coach at Anfield, the Northern Irishman immediately went back on that handshake deal with his former employers to return for Allen.",
      "A furious Swansea lambasted Liverpool for reneging on “a written agreement” not to sign any of their players within a year of Rodgers’ appointment, but a clause which permitted Allen to join the Reds, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Man Utd for £15m overrode any informal accord.",
      "Swansea, realising Rodgers was likely willing to drag them through every court around the globe and fight to the death to sign a player so courageous, relented and decided to just win the League Cup with Ki Sung-yueng instead.",

      "Sandro ranks 18th and 12th. Peter Crouch is 8th and 5th. And Defoe comes 14th and 2nd. It is an unfathomably effective way of saying someone managed Spurs, Portsmouth and QPR without explicitly stating it.",
      "And the only thing preventing Niko Kranjcar from making that list is that he did not cost all that much on any of the three separate occasions Redknapp signed him.",
      "“This is the third club I have signed him for. I know what a top-class player he is,” Redknapp said after making Defoe his first signing as Spurs manager in January 2009, spending £15m on a player he bought for £9m as Portsmouth boss 12 months before, and West Ham poached for £1m or so before the turn of the millennium.",
      "That shared history spawned one of the great Redknapp stories – how he downplayed the need for Defoe to undergo a medical before completing the deadline day rule-breaking Portsmouth move “because he knew me from a kid and that” – but it was in north London where he laid the foundations for success on those diminutive but broad shoulders as his first purchase.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s new left-back won’t have too much difficulty in making more of a mark at Man Utd than the first signings of the post-Fergie managers.",

      "The centre-half had played a key part in their rise from the Championship and as that year’s official Promoted Team That Makes A Load Of New Signings, it made perfect sense from Villa’s viewpoint if no-one else’s.

The only difference this time was the ridicule he faced upon that switch to north London as a twice-relegated keeper signed as back-up for Bernd Leno.",

      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival.

That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",

      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",

      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",

But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’, but even when he does make that first international appearance, he will remain England’s most expensive uncapped player ever at least in spirit.",

      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",

      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",

      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",

      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",

      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",

      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",

      "Saturday 7 June 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",
