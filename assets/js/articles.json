      "Former Premier League goalkeeper Joe Hart admits he wanted to leap to the defence of Altay Bayindir after his error for Manchester United - but simply couldn't justify his blunder.",
      "The Turkish shotstopper was given a rare opportunity with Andre Onana still out but failed to take his chance and his early mistake ultimately proved costly in the result as Arsenal left Old Trafford with all three points.",
      "Bayindir failed to deal with a Declan Rice corner and, whilst he was under pressure, could only flap at the ball, which deflected into the path of Riccardo Calafiori who headed home the winning goal inside the opening 15 minutes.",
      "Hart, who was a first choice for Manchester City and West Ham, was determined to try and defend his fellow goalkeeper but after seeing the replay was unable to find a justification as he criticised Bayindir for getting too involved with Arsenal defender William Saliba.",
      "He said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I immediately got ready to defend Altay Bayindir, and then I saw the first replay and thought, 'I can’t defend him here'.",
      "\"Personally, I like to have my own defender in front of me so I can use him as a shield against an attacker and that’s not the option they’ve gone for.",
      "\"Saliba has done enough, but not done too much. Ideally, he wants to punch that with his right hand. He has got far too involved and got lost and made a bit of a mess with it. It’s not a foul. Bayindir has got to scrap with his left arm to deal with Saliba and jab the ball away with his right.\"",
      "Amorim questioned the rules after he claimed Bayindir was potentially blocked off, but also issued a quick reminder of his quality by referencing his display in United's FA Cup win at Arsenal last season. The Portuguese coach also knocked back the suggestion that the team need a new goalkeeper amid links with the likes of Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emi MArtinez.",
      "“We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal, and we were the better team. I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",

      "Roy Keane has punctured the feeling of optimism around Manchester United after their opening match of the Premier League season ended in defeat. United were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday as two familiar problems continued for Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game with a close-range header early on after Altay Bayindir flapped at Declan Rice’s corner. There were United Premier League debuts for £200million new signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but David Raya left with a clean sheet.",
      "United struggled in the goalkeeping department last season, where Andre Onana was inconsistent, while they managed just 44 goals in 38 matches in 2024/25. Nevertheless, Amorim sounded a note of optimism post-match, claiming “we were not boring” – an analysis which was quickly dismissed by Keane.",
      "“But we’ve mentioned it many times before, there are problems at the back. We’ve heard noises about them not being boring, but ultimately you’ve got to score goals to win football matches or you’re constantly under pressure.",
      "“The expectations around the club are so low now that everyone is almost happy.” Later he was asked to predict where his old club would finish. “Mid-table – 10th, maybe ninth,” he said.",
      "Summing up his feelings, he added: “The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary [Neville] said on commentary, everyone is OK with a 1-0 defeat. They’ve got to do better. It does worry me.",
      "“Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power. Things will improve, it’s tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There’s still problems there with Man United.”",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha troubled Arsenal’s defence and showed signs of a good understanding before Sesko came off the bench in the second half. Amorim has now won just seven of his 28 league games and after finishing 15th last season, Keane explained what should come next.",
      "\"I think it's about trying to rebuild the team, get some confidence, get some momentum early in the season. Last year, obviously nowhere near good enough, we know that,” he said before kick-off.",
      "\"The biggest issue they had all season despite chatting about the goalkeeper and the defence, they didn't score enough goals. When you're not scoring enough goals, particularly if you're Manchester United when they've invested so much money, you're constantly under pressure.",
      "\"They've obviously tried to fix that this summer. The signings, looking at them in pre-season, I know it's still early but yeah, the signs are good.",
      "\"They've obviously brought two players in who know the Premiership, they're robust enough to deal with the challenge of that and obviously they needed a goalscorer, so they were constantly under pressure. Looking at it, I like the look of it.\"",

      "As if the drama surrounding Alexander Isak's wish to join Liverpool wasn't taxing enough, a host of transfer targets have spurned the club in favour of others. Players such as Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and, perhaps most heartbreakingly, Benjamin Sesko have all turned down moves to St James' Park.",
      "Given that the Magpies are currently competing in the Champions League and won the Carabao Cup last season, their recruitment team must be left wondering. Ferdinand is another high-profile figure who can't fathom why so many players have shunned the club.",
      "Speaking on his show Rio Ferdinand Presents, when quizzed about why players keep rejecting Newcastle, the former England skipper responded: \"I don't know.",
      "\"Why does no one want to go there? You know what? The north east, what a place to play football. If you said to some players, 'You are going to walk out at St. James' Park, full house every week, being supported to the hills,' it's an unbelievable atmosphere.\"",
      "Despite numerous rejections, United have managed to secure the signature of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55million, reports Chronicle Live.",
      "Howe was also able to add new central defender Malick Thiaw, who joined from AC Milan for around £34.6m including add-ons, to his squad that drew 0-0 with Aston Villa on Saturday. Jacob Ramsey has now also joined from Villa.",
      "Newcastle are also reportedly hot on the heels of Brentford forward Yoane Wissa, but it's hard to ignore the ongoing saga with superstar Isak.",
      "The Swedish striker was noticeably absent from the 0-0 draw against Villa, leading Howe to utilise Anthony Gordon as an impromptu centre forward, flanked by Harvey Barnes and Elanga on the wings.",
      "It seems unlikely that Isak will don the United jersey again after declaring his refusal to play for the club. However, Howe is keeping the door ajar for further discussions with Isak and the club, if he decides to engage.",
      "\"Nothing has changed. The door is well and truly open,\" said Howe. \"He has to decide what he wants to do. We would like a resolution. We need that clarity. You don't need any kind of distraction.",
      "\"I am not in control of that. There is one person who can control that. Let's wait and see. I have made my stance clear. I am concentrating on the team.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is hopeful the trio will provide United with more cutting edge in the final third and he is also keen to strengthen his midfield, with Baleba emerging as their top target earlier this summer.",
      "They entered talks with Brighton earlier this month, but United are unwilling to pay the £120m that the Seagulls are demanding. However, reports have claimed that Baleba is keen on a move to Old Trafford and prepared to keep pushing for it even if that means waiting until next summer.",
      "Despite the ongoing speculation about his future, Baleba did start for Brighton as they drew 1-1 with Fulham in their Premier League opener on Saturday. And the 21-year-old took to social media after the game, posting a series of snaps with the caption: \"Just me doing the thing I love most.",
      "\"Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba's caption appears to be a reference to comments made by Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler ahead of the game when he was quizzed on the midfielder's future. When asked if he believes Baleba will remain at Brighton, Hurzeler replied: \"I am very, very confident.",
      "\"I didn't see any change, he's only changed his hair. I think that's the change he's made in the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place, he's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player. I didn't see any big changes and he's an option to start tomorrow\".",

      "The Manchester City and England midfielder has fallen out of favour with boss Pep Guardiola and played only 715 Premier League minutes last season. But now he’s joined Everton looking to get back to his best with the World Cup coming next summer. Moyes is hoping he can do what he did with Lingard, when he signed him on loan from Manchester United at West Ham in 2021 which saw the player find form and earn an England recall.",
      "The Everton boss said: “I think we are all saying there is a Jack Grealish who played for Aston Villa, there’s one who played for Manchester City, one we’ve seen playing for England and along the line there he is playing for arguably the best manager in the world. So I take his thoughts as well but I have to find ways of getting the best out of players as well.",
      "“Jesse Lingard is an example. If we can get him to be as successful as that this year it would be great. Without putting all the pressure on Jack, and I think he carries a lot of pressure anyway because of who he is and what he is, I think he’s got a wee bit where he has to prove one or two people (wrong) as well. I’m looking forward to seeing how he does.”",
      "Moyes did not speak to Guardiola before completing the move for Grealish but has been confident he would join this summer for a while. The Scot said: “I didn’t speak directly to Pep about it, although he has him closely and is one of the best managers and chooses what he wants.",
      "“My choice is that I think he can bring us something which we’ve not got, a bit more flair and hopefully more creativity to our attacking line. What convinced me is the knowledge that he thinks he’s got a little bit to prove and to stand up. I’ve had to do that myself personally. I’ve had to come back from being knocked down. Sometimes you have to have that resilience to bounce back, to fight back and to show everybody.",
      "“I just sense that Jack is carrying that with him now. I hope it shows through this season because, if it does, then we’ll get a lot of good things from Jack if he does.”",
      "Moyes is trying to rebuild Everton’s squad after a mass exodus of first-team players at the end of last season. He’s brought in Grealish, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Thierno Barry, Adam Aznou, Mark Travers and Carlos Alcaraz has made his loan permanent.",
      "Moyes added: “I think the club have done brilliantly to build a new stadium. It has taken years to happen but they’ve got there eventually and done it. I think now there has to be a building of a football club back inside it, to get it back to where it was and more importantly to get the team back to where it was. Or closer to where it should be.",
      "“We are a long way off at the moment. I don’t think we can do that in this window and make the team what we want it to be, but we are going to need people along the journey to make it more exciting and make people want to come and play.",
      "“Whether that is through high-profile players or our league position or how we are playing and our performances, we are needing some of them to give us a lift now. There’s been quite a few players who I’ve been disappointed have not chosen to come to Everton this summer and I think that’s because, if you look at the last four or five years, we’ve not been in great shape.",

The draws stat alluded to by Keane relates to the 14 Arsenal chalked up in the league, as they finished 10 points behind Liverpool despite losing the same number of matches.",

Then you add in the set-pieces and they are a good team. I would just like to see them be a little more brave.”",

      "Football loving writer who spends much of his life on motorways getting to games all over the country. Passionate about football, my job and the Mirror. The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "It was hardly a classic but the away end celebrated to a familiar song.",
      "“1-0 to the Arsenal” rang round Old Trafford after the final whistle as the Gunners ended up sitting pretty by winning ugly for a change. Scrappy does not do it justice and the result was more about familiar failings rather than any of the new big-money signings for either side.",
      "Ultimately, it was decided by a tale of two keepers as Arsenal’s David Raya was man-of-the-match while Manchester United’s Altay Bayındır had a stinker on Riccardo Calafiori’s winner. United have spent £200m on a new front three and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were excellent while Benjamin Sesko had a decent cameo as a late substitute. But unless they sign a keeper, all of their good work elsewhere will be undermined.",
      "Last season’s No.1 Andre Onana is being frozen out, Bayındır is hopeless on crosses and they desperately need to plug the gap otherwise they will not push on. Arsenal’s own big money striker, £64m hitman Viktor Gyokeres, looked heavy, ineffective and the visitors looked way better when Kai Havertz came on. Martin Zubimendi impressed throughout.",
      "But Arsenal, for all their own big-money spending, have not solved the left sided problem as Gabriel Martinelli ran down blind alleys and Noni Madueke barely got a look-in when he came on. Arsenal certainly did not look as sharp or ready as either of their title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City, although you could argue that winning at Old Trafford is still the most eye-catching result of the weekend.",
      "Beating this United side is hardly the statement result it once was but holding on for a gritty, defiant and determined win is still probably a message of intent for the rest of the season. Whether Arsenal have enough to dig in and scrap for enough of these wins remains to be seen. But they showed real character on a day when too few of their players were at their best.",
      "It is hard to read too much into the opening day and, if anything, United should be most encouraged by Mbeumo’s threat and Cunha’s brilliance. But United ended up with Harry Maguire coming on for his aerial threat at set pieces. There were some late scares, last ditch clearances and yet Arsenal held on.",
      "Arsenal are the team which still boss free kicks and corners. That is how Arsenal won the game and the away end unashamedly sang: “Set piece again, ole, ole.” Declan Rice’s corner was whipped in and, for all the warnings about pushing and shoving in pre-season, there was plenty in the United box.",
      "Bayındır's lame attempt at a punch did not work and there was Riccardo Calafiori to head home after just 13 minutes. What a start. But Arsenal did not settle and, if anything, United took charge and provided the bigger threat. Patrick Dorgu’s low shot hit the post. Cunha’s brilliant low cross shot forced a sensational save from Raya.",
      "Mbeumo’s header forced another great save from Raya who, despite his size, looked like a giant as he punched and caught every high ball into the box. Arsenal went through their repertoire of substitutes and their bench now looks very strong but whether the depth will plug the gap for the missing quality and X Factor - particularly down the left - which they need to win the title.",
      "As for United, they do look better than last season. Mbeumo and Cunha are exciting signings and, when fully fit, Sesko will be a handful. But they have to find a solution to their keeper problem. And it is no wonder why United are still in the market for a midfielder because they have holes in the starting line-up.",
      "However, United do look better and there are signs despite the frustration. Arsenal got their reward from a high risk, high reward opening fixture. No wonder Mikel Arteta looked so happy afterwards.",

      "They spent £200m on the attack but if Jim Ratcliffe and Co don’t find another lump of cash to buy a keeper at the back then there will be no improvement in results.",
      "Manchester United’s performance here was better and might give head coach Ruben Amorim hope that they won’t be as terrible as they were last season. It has been a while since United were dominant against one of the Premier League big boys.",
      "But for all the good play they didn’t score. New buys Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who was brought on for his debut in the second half - drew a blank. That will happen against the best teams and especially one as defensively resolute as Arsenal.",
      "But what is unforgivable is gifting goals to the opposition and Altay Bayindir did just that. The Turkish shot stopper was picked ahead of Andre Onana - who was left out of the squad despite being fit - but he flapped at the 13th-minute corner which led to the Gunners' winner.",
      "It’s not the first time he has shown weakness at set-pieces. He conceded a similar goal against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup last season. So there’s evidence it is an issue yet United have not sorted it this summer.",
      "It is quite clear that after two seasons at the club Onana is not good enough to be the No.1 at Old Trafford. Was Amorim sending a message to his bosses here by leaving him out and playing his deputy, who is somehow worse?",
      "If so it was a costly one because it backfired as United got their Premier League season off to a losing start in a campaign Amorim needed them to hit the ground running to keep the pressure off. Obviously United needed to bolster their front line given the fact they scored just 44 league goals last season - the lowest tally outside of the relegated three.",
      "But games against their biggest rivals are going to be won by moments and Bayindir could only slap the ball down to Riccardo Calafiori for the decisive one of this game. He should have been clearing out William Saliba as he backed into him but instead he was bullied by the Gunners’ centre-half.",
      "United haven’t been shy boasting about their sporting structure and earning plaudits for beating rivals like Newcastle to signings. Yet they’ve not thought it was a good idea to bring in a new goalkeeper before the start of the season?",
      "That’s a worrying blind spot if you’re a United supporter. They still have two weeks to sort it out before the window closes but the clock is ticking and they might fall further behind if Bayindir or Onana make any more messes in the next fortnight.",

      "The more things change, the more they stay the same. Manchester United suffered defeat in their opening Premier League match of the season, falling to a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford - a goal from a set piece proving the difference between the two sides.",
      "That the Gunners’ winner should have come about that way shouldn’t have been a surprise. Ruben Amorim may have splashed £200million on a new attack this summer, but conceding from corners has troubled United more than any other side in the past two seasons; no one has conceded more from corners than their 23 goals in the Premier League since the start of 2023-24.",
      "Conversely, over that same period, Arsenal have scored 31 times. That’s 11 more than the next best: Liverpool on 20.",
      "For all that fingers will be pointed at stand-in ‘keeper Altay Bayindir for his role in Riccardo Calafiori’s winner - and fingers will indeed be pointed at the Turkey international because it was weak, dismal goalkeeping under the tiniest amount of pressure from William Saliba - the goal was just the continuation of a very familiar theme for United.",
      "Amorim promised a new era when he spoke to the crowd at the end of last season, but he needs to stamp out such overfamiliar problems. They will continue to cost his side until he does. And such stupid goals will continue to be conceded so long as his players aren't willing to point fingers at one another and call out mistakes.",
      "\"When you touch the goalkeeper and he can't jump, that makes it difficult for Bayindir,\" said captain Bruno Fernandes. \"And unfortunately he couldn't keep it out of the goal.\"",
      "United looked far better than the side that finished 15th last season – their worst top-flight campaign since 1974. Indeed, Amorim insisted: \"We deserved more. It is clear we were the better team but we lost.\"",
      "This was far from a vintage performance from Arsenal. They were some way below their best. But they walk away with three points and an opening day success away from home. For all their huff and puff, United left with nothing.",
      "Indeed, Arsenal allowed 22 shots on their goal. The last time United managed that many against the Gunners in the Premier League, they managed 25 and scored EIGHT in an infamous 8-2 thrashing 14 years ago. This time, David Raya only made one real save of note, a brilliant low fingertip save to deny £62.5m Matheus Cunha.",
      "For Amorim, it was his 15th defeat in 28 Premier League games. Remarkably, it is the fastest a manager has reached 15 defeats in the top flight - provided he hasn't taken over a newly promoted team - since Paul Hart hit 15 losses in 27 games as Portsmouth boss in 2009, 16 years ago.",
      "More will almost certainly follow unless he improves his side's defending at set pieces. He can focus on having his side play 'his way' as much as he likes. But they need to start doing the rest right too.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A howler from Altay Bayindir condemned Manchester United to an opening-day defeat and gifted Arsenal three points in their fresh pursuit of the Premier League title. Mikel Arteta's side weren't at their best but did enough to quell the Red Devils, who had an afternoon of deja vu - conceding from a set piece and failing to score.",
      "Arsenal took just 13 minutes to break the deadlock, profiting from Bayindir's error. United's backup goalkeeper, given the nod over the fit-again Andre Onana, flapped at a corner and allowed Riccardo Calafiori a simple tap-in after evading the home defence.",
      "An end-to-end first half saw no more goals, with the visitors in front. United pushed for an equaliser throughout the second 45, as Ruben Amorim introduced Benjmamin Sesko in search of a goal.",
      "But Arsenal held firm to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City at this early stage. For the Red Devils, it was a largely positive display but a reminder of how big Amorim's challenge truly is, on a day where he set an unwanted 16-year Premier League record.",
      "Here are five talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "Barring the two debutants for each side, the big talking point when team news was confirmed was the absence of Andre Onana from United's squad. The Cameroonian goalkeeper missed the entirety of pre-season with a hamstring injury but despite being full recovered, Altay Bayindir got the nod.",
      "Ruben Amorim would surely regret his decision when in the 13th minute, Bayindir failed his first test. Declan Rice patiently waited to swing in a corner, increasing the tension among the hosts' defence.",
      "His delivery was right on top of Bayindir and with minimal contact from William Saliba, the Turkey international was shoved out the way and could only get half a punch on the ball. Riccardo Calafiori was lurking at the back post for the simplest finish of his career, as Bayindir's appeals for a foul fell on deaf ears.",
      "It was a tale of two goalkeepers in the first half. Although Arsenal boasted the lead at the break, United had fired off double the amount of attempts on goal and hit post through Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The Red Devils were dangerous on the counter attack, with Bryan Mbeumo a constant threat in the channel between Gabriel Magalhaes and Calafiori. But it was Matheus Cunha who forced David Raya into a magnificent save which kept the Gunners ahead just before half-time.",
      "After battling with Rice on the left-hand side of the box, United's new No.10 did well to get a shot off which looked destined to find the net. In a brilliant reaction save, Raya got down to his left and flicked the ball away, leaving Cunha in disbelief.",
      "Arsenal's goalkeeper hadn't been perfect in the first half but did his job when it mattered - just like late on to push away Mbeumo's header. There was much to improve on for the Gunners in the second period but crucially, they had the advantage.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was always going to be playing at Old Trafford on Sunday, there only question for most of the summer transfer window was on which side? Arsenal won the race for his signature in July and Mikel Arteta will hope that he's still finding his feet after a rusty Premier League debut.",
      "The Swedish striker's first start for Arsenal could be summed up by one moment during the first half. After putting Matthijs de Ligt on the floor with a nonchalant show of strength, Gyokeres immediately gave the ball away in United's box, wasting an attacking opportunity.",
      "On the hour mark, his day was done. Kai Havertz entered the fray alongside new signing Noni Madueke while Amorim handed out his own debut. Enter: Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After Sesko came on with 25 minutes to go, we got to see United's new-look attack for the first time. Cunha, Mbeumo and the Slovenian striker make up the Red Devil's £207.5million outlay, showcasing where Amorim feels that his team need to improve most.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo got the crowd off their feet with a number of dribbles and darting runs, although they couldn't deliver the crucial goal. Nor could Sesko, who was given scraps to feed off as United chased a winner, with Harry Maguire brought on to help in both boxes.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "A win and a clean sheet away from home? The ideal start. It certainly wasn't a vintage Arsenal performance, particularly in possession, but they got the job done.",
      "Say that in April and you'd hail it the mark of champions. There's a long way to go this season but the Gunners are up and running, with typically steely defending and a superior goalkeeper making the difference.",

Bayindir called for a foul following the incident due to pressure from Gunners defender William Saliba. While Calafiori and Arsenal's celebrations seemed somewhat muted, VAR did not feel the incident needed to be highlighted to referee Simon Hooper. And Neville simply believed that Bayindir's efforts were not strong enough to prevent a goal.",
      "“It’s going to keep hurting United,\" said Neville from the commentary box. \"The goalkeeper has got to be stronger. I think he will complain that he was fouled. He’s got a player in front of him, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on. I just think your goalkeeper has to be stronger.",
      "\"Get that player out of the way. It’s Saliba. He’s not got his arms up, I don’t think he’s done anything wrong at all. Bayandir if anything has his arm on him. He just parries it, it goes through his hands. It’s definitely a goal. He’s just not strong enough.”",
      "Clinton Morrison, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said simply: \"Manchester United need to strengthen their goalkeeper. There are top goalkeepers around that are available and you're only as good as your goalkeeper.\"",
      "Bayindir was given the nod in goal as Andre Onana missed out on Amorim's squad at Old Trafford. The former Inter Milan and Ajax star has been absent throughout pre-season due to injury but is now said to be fit.",
      "Amorim noted that he simply wanted to keep faith in the players that had performed during pre-season. United's boss left the door open to Onana returning next week however.",
      "He said: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life. This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "Pre-match, Onana was seen in the tunnel alongside United forward Rasmus Hojlund. The Denmark international was also missing from Amorim's squad with a move possible for the forward this summer after Benjamin Sesko's arrival.",
      "The new striker started the game on the bench after signing for the club a week ago. Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were given the responsibility of leading United's frontline.",

The Red Devils also want to sign a midfielder and potentially a goalkeeper, having already spent £207.5m.",

      "Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury in early July and missed the Red Devils' pre-season fixtures. However, both he and United had hoped that he would be ready to start the season in goal for Ruben Amorim's men. But Onana's rehab hasn't gone completely to plan, he's only trained on a handful of occasions since being given the go-ahead to resume and spent the early part of Sunday training alone at United's Carrington training base.",

      "Former Feyenoord defender Malacia has struggled for minutes since returning from a long spell out through injury. The Dutch international ended last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven, but the Eredivisie champions haven't made the move permanent.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim doesn't appear to see a future at Old Trafford for Malacia, leaving him out of United's pre-season tour while working to seal an exit. Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony were also left at home, with Rashford already completing a loan move to Barcelona.",
      "Sancho had been linked with Juventus earlier in the summer, with their Serie A rivals also in the mix. And now, according to reports from the continent, Roma have enquired about Malacia during discussions over a potiential Sancho swoop.",
      "Roma aren't the only ones keeping tabs on Malacia, either. Besiktas have also been mentioned, with former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer potentially linking up with Erik ten Hag's first United signing.",
      "Malacia was not part of United's matchday squad for their Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday. Patrick Dorgu was picked to start at left wing-back while Luke Shaw - another option in the position - took his place as the left-most of Amorim's three centre-backs.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started, though there was no place for young left-back Diego Leon after his summer move. Benjamin Sesko, who joined a week ago but didn't feature in United's pre-season programme, started on the bench.",
      "This is despite Amorim indicating in the lead-up to the game that the Slovenian was in consideration to start. \"Of course. We didn't have a lot of time but he's ready,\" the boss said.",
      "\"First of all, physically, he's ready. That is a big component in our league. Then, he's really smart. Every detail he asks, he's a guy that is always thinking. He spends all afternoon here working on his fitness, so he's ready to play, we will see if he's going to start.\"",
      "United have secured a number of loan exits during the summer window but are still waiting to complete a first significant sale. Rasmus Hojlund could be the first to leave for a fee, having been left out of the squad for Sunday's opener.",
      "In the lead-up to the Arsenal clash, midfielder Toby Collyer completed a season-long loan move to West Bromwich Albion. The young midfielder made his Baggies debut from the bench on Saturday as they beat Wrexham 3-2.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Altay Bayindir was given the nod to start Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday, with Andre Onana left out by Ruben Amorim. The former Inter Milan stopper, who cost United £47million two years ago, was not included in the matchday squad.",
      "Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury in early July and missed the Red Devils' pre-season fixtures. However, both he and United had hoped that he would be ready to start the season in goal for Ruben Amorim's men. But Onana's rehab hasn't gone completely to plan, he's only trained on a handful of occasions since being given the go-ahead to resume and spent the early part of Sunday training alone at United's Carrington training base.",
      "However, Amorim insisted he WAS fit enough to play - he had merely chosen not to go with the Cameroon international. He said: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life. This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "As such, the Turkey international was given the nod to start in goal at Old Trafford for the visit of last year's Premier League runners-up, on a day where four new signings featured for both sides.",
      "Only two new signings were included by Amorim in the home side's starting lineup, with Matheus Cunha, the £62.5m arrival from Wolves, chosen to lead the attack. Bryan Mbeumo, £71m from Brentford also got the nod, with Mason Mount making up the side's attacking triumvirate. Benjamin Sesko, the £74m centre-forward, signed from RB Leipzig, had to make do with a place on the bench.",
      "While Sesko was made to wait, Arsenal's new centre-forward, Viktor Gyokeres, was thrust straight into the starting lineup by Mikel Arteta. The £64m Swede, who joined from Sporting Lisbon, was one of two new signings in the Gunners' lineup, with Spain international midfielder Martin Zubimendi given the nod to hold midfield alongside Declan Rice.",
      "Summer signings Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke and Cristhian Mosquera were all among the Arsenal substitutes, where Myles Lewis-Skelly also found himself, with Riccardo Calafiori having been preferred in the starting lineup.",

      "Manchester United's midfield could scupper Ruben Amorim's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League, according to Paul Scholes. The Red Devils have attacked the transfer window again this season by bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nearly £200million has been forked out so far, but the United boss has pumped the majority of his transfer kitty into bolstering his attacking options. Finding the back of the net proved a massive headache for United last term, but doubts still remain over the midfield.",
      "The Red Devils had shown interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, but have since cooled their pursuit after it became apparent the Seagulls won't be parting with him. Considering United's spending spree and the standard across the Premier League, Scholes confessed the engine room could prove to be Amorim's biggest headache.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes, when pressed on what he believes success would look like for United, said: \"It's a tricky one after being so bad last year. Now seasons can change.",
      "\"We saw last year with Nottingham Forest, it doesn't have to take five to 10 years to get back where you want to be. Although it is looking better, I still think there are issues with the team. The midfield, I know we don't want to go through it again. But, top six. I think top six would be more than acceptable.",
      "\"As much as you don't want to say that, I always think Manchester United should aim for the very best and aim for the highest. I am just not sure. I think there are too many good teams now.",
      "\"I think Liverpool, Chelsea and City are all on the up. Arsenal [as well], I did not even mention Aston Villa, Newcastle. I think there is a lot of competition now to get top six.\"",
      "According to talkSPORT, England and Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has surfaced as a potential transfer target instead of Baleba. Nevertheless, Palace have previously suggested the former Blackburn Rovers ace carries a £100m valuation.",
      "Currently, United are expected to enter the season with Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as their primary central midfield choices. Ugarte failed to make a significant impact during his first season at Old Trafford, whilst Mainoo also struggled when deployed as one of two defensive midfielders.",
      "Furthermore, doubts remained over Casemiro's pace considering he has now reached 33 years of age, whilst Fernandes' assets lie in his creativity and finishing ability.",
      "Nevertheless, should any of the midfielders manage to take command of United's engine room, Scholes would prefer it to be Mainoo. He added: \"I think we spoke last year about, what they lack in the midfield is that controlling midfield player.",
      "\"I thought that was going to be him (Mainoo). It seems like it's a little bit confused now. Can he be that midfielder again? Can he be that midfielder who can play in a two? He'll obviously need a lot of legs around him. Or is he now one of the No. 10s? I'm just confused.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be left out of Manchester United's squad to face Arsenal in a brutal decision by Ruben Amorim. Hojlund, 22, faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the Red Devils signed fellow striker Benjamin Sesko for £74million.",
      "The Dane has interest from several clubs across Europe, including AC Milan, but has said that he wants to stay and fight for his place at United. That's despite them sticking a £30m price tag on him and with Hojlund having been an unused substitute during the Red Devils' final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina last Saturday.",
      "Amorim's decision, as first reported by the Athletic, will undoubtedly increase speculation over Hojlund's future, having joined the Red Devils for £72m just two years ago. During his pre-match press conference, the United manager skirted around a question about whether the 22-year-old was still part of his long-term plans.",
      "\"He's one more option, we will see,\" Amorim replied ahead of Sunday's 4:30pm kick-off. \"We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "The Red Devils boss also confirmed that Joshua Zirkzee, another option up front, is now ready to return after working his way back to full fitness during pre-season. New signing Sesko is set to be involved against Arsenal in some capacity, having only had a week to work with his new team-mates following his big-money move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Privately, Hojlund has maintained his professionalism and has so far given no indication that he wants to leave. While Old Trafford chiefs were negotiating for Sesko, Hojlund insisted that he wanted to stay and fight for his place, insisting that he's 'more than ready' for competition.",
      "\"The most important [thing] for me is to keep working hard and stay focused and then we'll see what happens,\" the Denmark international told reporters during the Red Devils' tour of the USA.",
      "\"My plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready.\"",
      "Also in pre-season, Amorim hailed: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market,\" he said.",
      "\"The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. I don’t know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a lot because of the lack of goals last season.\"",
      "Hojlund has scored 26 goals in 95 games for United since joining from Italian side Atalanta in August 2023. If he were to leave, the Red Devils would prefer a permanent sale as opposed to a loan deal.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 to Arsenal in their opening Premier League game of the season on Sunday.",
      "United looked bright in the early stages but any momentum they were building soon disappeared when Altay Bayindir flapped at a corner and allowed Riccardo Calafiori to head home.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came off the bench with 25 minutes to play but it was Bryan Mbeumo who went closest to equalising with an acrobatic effort that went wide followed by a header that was well saved by David Raya.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Lucky to play for United again after he conceded direct from a corner at Tottenham and he practically did it again. Should be nowhere near the starting XI. 4",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not play as much on the front foot as in pre-season and had little hassle from Arsenal's forwards in open play. Switched to the left after Luke Shaw was substituted. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Pitted directly against Viktor Gyokeres, De Ligt's own frame has been the topic of debate in the past but the Arsenal striker appeared overweight. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Amorim instructed United to launch attacks through Shaw, who did not disgrace himself at the start of his 12th season with the club. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Offered Mbeumo ample support and got into the box to provide some crosses that came to nought. Made way for Amad before the hour. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Arsenal could have steamrollered Casemiro but they let him off. The Brazilian still merely existed in an area that Declan Rice bossed. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Scored United's goals against Arsenal last term but started badly and did not improve enough. Too rash with and without the ball. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struck the post after a positive charge towards the Arsenal area at 0-1 but struggled to maintain that level of threat in the second half. Rightly booked. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Played one memorable pass but that was about it from a player whose best work is almost always off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with him. 5",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Continued his promising pre-season form and had the measure of Calafiori. Had shots at goal but none threatening enough. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Made a good fist of the centre forward role. Had chances, drew a terrific save from Raya and worked tirelessly all afternoon. 7",
      "Subs",
      "Amad",
      "Injected energy into the attacks from wide right. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Had little of the ball. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Upped the tempo in midfield. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Immediately conceded a foul. 5",
      "Manager",
      "Picked a team teeming with contentious calls and one of them - the goalkeeper - cost United. Absence of an out-and-out striker was felt as Mount flopped again. 5",

    "body": [
      "A home defeat without scoring is familiar fare from Manchester United. Their productive performance was unfamiliar.",
      "United were the more enterprising and energetic team, fuelled by the optimistic atmosphere that was enhanced by pre-match adjustments. United fashioned more goalscoring chances in one afternoon against Arsenal than they did in one month last season.",
      "Yet the bottom line is they lost their opening fixture for the eighth time in the Premier League era. United have been beaten 16 times at home in the league since the start of the 2023-24 campaign. Ruben Amorim was not on his haunches as much but his hands were often planted on his crown.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt dropped to the turf at full-time. United players and staff still embarked on a lap of honour. Purists would rather see them head straight down the tunnel for a raw debrief.",
      "Hope is at least back again at United, in spite of another home reverse. The six added minutes elicited an excitable cheer. There was no air of resignation as there was throughout the defeatist performances of last season.",
      "But no striker and no goals. Benjamin Sesko crossed the white line to the sound of an expectant roar in the 65th minute. His inactive cameo partly legislated for why Amorim did not start him.",
      "Few teams are better equipped to defend a lead than Arsenal, a throwback to George Graham's artisans. United were undone by another Arsenal set piece.",
      "This was an archetypal 1-0-to-the-Ar-se-nal. They were second best for the majority of the afternoon and their supporters were constantly irked by the referee, Simon Hooper. They still shielded their goal for 77 minutes whilst leading.",
      "United, having invested almost £74million in a new number nine, played without one. Amorim has refused to accommodate Rasmus Hojlund after he aired his intention to stay and the strikerless experiments against Everton in Atlanta and Fiorentina in Manchester signposted a similar set-up against Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund is so unwanted he was omitted from the matchday squad with Joshua Zirkzee available again. Hojlund, loitering in the tunnel pre-match, watched the first half from the directors' box but was not visible in the second half.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made up the front three in United's final friendly against Fiorentina. The only goal United managed was an own goal. They lined up together again and this time there was no goal.",
      "Amorim's team was littered with contentious calls and the 'keeper was the costliest. Altay Bayindir was fortunate to play for United again after he conceded a winner direct from a corner at Tottenham in December and it practically happened again against the other north London club.",
      "Bayindir is not better than Tom Heaton, in his 40th year, never mind Andre Onana. United's first choice will reclaim his role at Fulham this week.",
      "Onana himself was cornered by Arsenal in their victory at the Emirates last season. The sight of Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes, stood forlornly in the technical area was as familiar as United trailing at half-time without scoring.",
      "It was in the 27th minute that the absence of Amad and a striker was visible. Mbeumo delayed his pass too long for the overlapping and offside Diogo Dalot, who crossed to an invisible centre forward, much to the supporters' chagrin. The broadcasters zoomed in on a watchful Sesko. Amad was the first game-changer sent on by Amorim.",
      "Sesko remained in the dugout when the first batch of substitutes headed out to warm up a minute into the second half. Zirkzee was among those to limber up. Amad was soon summoned and his sprints along the touchline were more urgent. Sesko joined them five minutes later.",
      "Amad and Bruno Fernandes were the only two players who started in all five of United's pre-season friendlies. To bench Amad was pragmatic, bordering on the negative. United were lifted by his zig-zag bursts into the Arsenal area.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Sesko could have easily joined their opponents. The Stretford End heckled Gyokeres with a rendition of \"You fat b*****d\". It would be diplomatic to describe him as heavy. So heavy that Casemiro caught up with Gyokeres in the United third after losing the ball inside the Arsenal half. The hostility from the United fans continued up to Gyokeres' withdrawal on the hour.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo gave a glimpse of how productive United's new front three could be. They were responsible for the four on-target attempts from United in the first half. Patrick Dorgu pinged the post. Mbeumo had the measure of the rash Riccardo Calafiori, booked in the 42nd minute for a tactical foul. Calafiori was still the only one to get on the scoresheet.",
      "Mount continues to produce his finest work off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with Mount, misguidedly promoted to the Europa League final starting XI at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. Mount and Casemiro were both hooked simultaneously.",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "Hearty applause followed United's near-misses, such was their encouraging play. Eight minutes in, Declan Rice turned to the Arsenal back four and attempted to gee them up. William Saliba's foul on Dorgu was as much to rouse himself and his teammates.",
      "Mikel Arteta almost encroached onto the pitch to berate the wasteful Gabriel Martinelli after a breakaway broke down. One of the Arsenal analysts reacted by smacking the wall of the press box.",
      "Amorim urged United to commence attacks through Luke Shaw. Sometimes United bided their time, waiting for room to free up either side of De Ligt, the meat in the back-three sandwich.",
      "It was another middle centre back Amorim turned to up the other end. Harry Maguire practically played up front in a team that has negotiated a fee upwards of £180m on three strikers. All three were present at the stadium as United fired blanks.",
      "That was familiar.",

      "Ruben Amorim defended his decision to start Altay Bayindir in goal for Manchester United, despite his error costing them an opening weekend defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Bayindir feebly attempted to punch away Declan Rice's inswinging corner, which ricocheted towards goal and was nodded in by Riccardo Calafiori for the only goal at Old Trafford on 13 minutes.",
      "Bayindir conceded a similar winner at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-final last season when he was beaten directly from Son Heung-min's corner.",
      "Amorim opted not to start Andre Onana against Arsenal as United's first-choice 'keeper had been involved in only three team training sessions since he recovered from a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in pre-season.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",
      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",
      "Amorim was coy on Rasmus Hojlund's future after he was omitted from the matchday squad. United are looking to sell Hojlund two years on from buying him from Atalanta in a £72million deal.",
      "\"He’s [got] to fight for the place,\" Amorim explained. \"We are going to see what happens in the market. [He has] different characteristics and Rasmus has the same characteristics as Benjamin Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, August 18th 2025.",
      "United’s Premier League season got up and running with a narrow defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started the match while Benjamin Sesko’s debut came as a second-half substitute, but Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal took all three points back to London.",
      "United continue to look for new faces to add to Ruben Amorim’s squad, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by the head coach thought to be on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton comes after it was reported that a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, with United relaxed about the situation and happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "There is also the small matter of sales to discuss with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Man United have previously been linked with an interest in RB Leipzig attacker Simons, who has impressed for both club and country in recent seasons.",
      "However, the 13-time Premier League champions would need to outmaneuver Chelsea’s pursuit of the 22-year-old, as Simons is reportedly leaning towards a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and were hopeful of starting the new campaign with a victory, but Arsenal left Manchester with a 1-0 victory after a Riccardo Calafiori goal.",
      "However, Fernandes was hesitant to say the result was unfair. \"I wouldn't say unfair, but I obviously think we came up a little bit short today,\" he said during a post-match interview with MUTV. \"Overall, we did something else to deserve a different result. It's very difficult to see the positive things when you lose the game, but we need to look forward and see next week what we can improve after this game. We will look at what we didn't do so good and what went wrong.\"",
      "When asked about the support from United fans throughout the game, Fernandes added: \"It was brilliant. Like I just said in a previous interview, they talk about hope in the team for what we did and everything.",
      "\"When I finished the game, what gave me hope for the season being very good for us and positive was the way the fans reacted. When we came around and came into the tunnel, they gave us hope with that. The next game is very important for us to give something back.\"",
      "The Sun claims that David De Gea is one of the goalkepers under consideration by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report states that the Spaniard has a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to return to the club at a reduced fee. United have just two weeks to strengthen their goalkeeping department this season, with Onana facing heavy scrutiny for his performances both last season and over the summer.",
      "He was left out of Amorim's squad for their Premier League clash with Arsenal. After the game, the Portuguese boss said: \"He's not injured, he's recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.\"",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has also been linked with a move to Manchester as he is expected to leave the French champions.",
      "Man United are far from sanctioning an exit for Sancho amid interest from AS Roma, claims TEAMtalk.",
      "United have reportedly verbally accepted a £20million offer from Roma for the winger, but reaching an agreement with the player is expected to be challenging. TEAMtalk understands that the main obstacle is Sancho’s wage demands.",
      "He currently earns £250,000 a week at United, with a contract running until next summer.",
      "Roma coach Gian Piero Gasperini is personally trying to persuade Sancho, but the player has reportedly shown no willingness to lower his salary for the move.",
      "Man United are reportedly trying to sanction a sale for Rasmus Hojlund before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Rasmus Hojlund [was] out of the squad and we know that Manchester United are trying to find a solution for him. They want Hojlund to go.",
      "\"They want to sell Hojlund as soon as possible. If a sale is not going to be possible, they want to do a loan with an option to buy – €6m loan fee, an option to buy around €40-45.",
      "\"So negotiations will now follow for Hojlund, with interest from AC Milan and more clubs around Europe, not only Milan.\"",
      "If Man United maintain their interest, they may face a lengthy queue of suitors ready to make an offer next year.",
      "According to The Athletic, Brighton acknowledge that, given the timing and the likelihood of a bidding war, this would be the ideal moment to sell.",
      "Hurzeler, who was asked about what he is looking for from Baleba this season, told reporters: \"Making the next step - getting more mature in decision-making, getting more mature regarding game management, being more consistent in the performances that we expect from him.\"",
      "If he hits those targets, Baleba is set to become one of the standout transfer stories of the summer 2026 window.",
      "Besides interest in Jadon Sancho, AS Roma have reportedly also made contact for Malacia.",
      "Taking to X to provide an update, Fabrizio Romano wrote: \"During talks with Man United for Sancho (no green light yet from Jadon), Roma also ask for Malacia deal conditions.",
      "\"Tyrell, keen on the move; Besiktas also interested in the Dutch left back.\"",
      "AC Milanare reportedly keen to strike a €35m (£30.2m) deal for Hojlund.",
      "The striker, who was left out of Ruben Amorim's squad on Sunday, is expected to leave the club if the right offer arrives.",
      "Milan are one of the interested sides, although they are also said to be considering Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic as an alternative.",
      "The Athletic journalist David Ornstein has quashed any chance of United pulling off a move for Wharton this summer.",
      "\"They've been linked to the likes of [Martin] Hjulmand at Sporting Lisbon and Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace,\" he told NBC Sports on Sunday. \"I'm not sure those are likely to come to fruition at this moment in time; they want to get players out of here.\"",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Man United are among three Premier League clubs showing interest in Brentford centre-back Nathan Collins.",
      "Reports suggest that interest in the Irish defender is 'surging,' though Brentford are expected to resist any attempts to lure him away. For United, however, any new signings are likely to depend on player departures from the current squad.",
      "New manager, and fellow Irishman, Keith Andrews praised the former Wolves defender, calling him 'a natural leader.'",
      "And welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, 18th August.",
      "Stay with us for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and opinion throughout the day."

      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo both showed glimpses of what United can expect this season and were perhaps unfortunate not to produce a goal contribution between them.",
      "In the second-half, Cunha looked more like the player that convinced United to pay £72.5million for him. After winning a foul in the corner against William Saliba, the attacker got up and interacted with the fans in the south stand and Stretford End.",
      "The urge for more noise was received well by the thousands of supporters. Cunha's effort was constantly applauded by the fans inside Old Trafford - it was certainly an encouraging debut.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United lost 1-0 in their opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was hoping to start the new campaign with a positive result, but Arsenal opened the scoring at Old Trafford in the 13th minute after a mistake from Altay Bayindir at a corner.",
      "Bayindir failed to properly connect with the corner and Riccardo Calafiori was gifted an easy header at the back post. United responded well and created enough chances to equalise, but a breakthrough proved elusive.",
      "Here are the talking points from the game and some moments you might have missed:",
      "Arsenal analysts were not happy",
      "Two Arsenal analysts sat together in the press box and one became particularly animated as United wrestled back control in the fixture after falling behind from a corner. There was even a moment when the Arsenal analyst reacted to a misplaced pass and lashed out at the desk in front of him.",
      "Gabriel Martinelli overhit a simple pass to Martin Odegaard on the counter-attack, much to the relief of Amorim on the sidelines, but the Arsenal analyst did not hide his frustration at the move breaking down.",
      "The pair also looked unhappy when Arsenal were dispossessed near the end of the first half. United created enough chances to be level by the interval and Arsenal were only leading due to Bayindir's shocking error.",
      "The frustration proves Arsenal were not good enough on Sunday afternoon, and they were fortunate to leave with three points.",
      "Same old story",
      "There was a melee in the box with just a few minutes to play. United were desperately trying to score an equaliser and committed bodies forward, but it just wouldn't go in for them.",
      "Benjamin Sesko turned his effort over the bar, high into the Stretford End, and Amorim responded on the touchline by placing his hands on his head. United have spent close to £200million on their attack this summer, but the same problem existed against Arsenal: they couldn't score.",
      "Having said that, United were the better side. There were signs of progress and positives to take, despite an opening day defeat.",
      "Cunha the crowd favourite",
      "Matheus Cunha made an immediate impact in the dressing room after his arrival from Wolves. The Brazilian is a huge personality and is a stereotypical fiery South American, so it always seemed likely he would become a fan favourite.",
      "And Cunha took the first steps to earning fan favourite status against Arsenal. He looked dangerous and roared at the crowd just before the hour mark after a scrappy physical battle with William Saliba.",
      "The 26-year-old won the ball near the tunnel by the Stetford End corner, fighting aggressively against Saliba. He reacted by vigorously first pumping to the crowd, who lapped it up. Cunha plays on the edge and he helped to whip up the crowd as United pushed for an equaliser.",
      "Cunha has the quality to back up his behaviour. He delivered an impressive performance on his competitive Old Trafford debut and didn't deserve to be on the losing side.",
      "What did Amorim expect?",
      "Amorim decided to play without a recognised striker against Arsenal. Sesko was ready to start the game, but he was named on the bench and Amorim's front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Cunha was fluid.",
      "Those three players took turns to play down the middle and regularly rotated positions, but the downside of that selection was seen in the first half when Diogo Dalot pulled a ball back into the box and nobody was there.",
      "Amorim was spotted shouting at Mount, who was positioned outside the box, but what did United's head coach expect? He shouldn't have been surprised to see Mount fail to think like a striker.",
      "Sesko was eventually introduced to the game in the 65th minute. The Slovenia international struggled to get into the contest, but it might have been a different story if he'd been included in the starting team.",
      "The directors' box",
      "Avram Glazer was spotted in the directors' box. The 64-year-old last made an appearance at Old Trafford for the opening game of last season against Fulham and showed his face again for the visit of Arsenal.",
      "The 1958 had planned to stage a protest against the club's ownership before facing Arsenal, but they decided to postpone the demonstration after surveying fans about whether it should go ahead.",
      "Whether that had something to do with Avram Glazer attending the game is up for debate. The American co-owner has deliberately made limited appearances in Manchester over the last few years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was among those seated n the directors' box. The striker was dropped from the squad and is being ruthlessly shown the door by Amorim after taking huge backwards steps last season.",
      "JJ Gabriel was also seen in the directors' box against Arsenal. The youngster is just 14 years old, but there is a buzz at United about his potential and the invite to watch the game shows how highly he is regarded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There was also a worrying repeat of United's inability to convert their chances, with Ruben Amorim hoping that Benjamin Sesko will fix that gaping hole in his team. And yet the Reds' overall performance against a likely Premier League title contender offers some room for optimism.",
      "United's XG (expected goals) of 1.59 was higher than Mikel Arteta's side, who managed an XG of 1.05. The Reds also had more possession (61.2 per cent) more shots (22) and shots on target (seven).",
      "But for a howler from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, then Amorim's men would have earned at least a point against one of Europe's best teams.",
      "Much of the improved display was down to United's improved pressing and organisation after a full pre-season under Amorim. Focus must now be on turning positive performances into results - a challenge the Reds have struggled with since their Portuguese head coach arrived in November 2024.",
      "The hope will now be that a combination of Cunha and Mbeumo's creativity will supply Sesko with plenty of chances to score and see United drastically improve on last season's meagre tally of just 44 Premier League goals.",
      "And yet there are still plenty of issues which cannot be fixed before the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Bayindir's blunder which handed the Gunners all three points put United's goalkeeping issues into sharp focus.",

The most important thing - we weren't boring. We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"",

      "The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who scored 58 goals between them last term has revolutionised United's front three and they could line up together for the first time against Arsenal.",
      "If they gel together quickly, United could have a much more positive season. Arsenal will hope there are teething problems at Old Trafford this afternoon.",
      "United decided to sign Sesko, as opposed to Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres who was the top goalscorer in Europe for each of the last two seasons.",
      "He spent the majority of that time playing under United boss Amorim and now he will be the man looking to put a dent into their early season hopes.",
      "United should have an indicator over whether they made the right decision in the transfer market at around 6:30 this evening.",
      "One of the big decisions facing Amorim is who will partner Bruno Fernandes at the base of the midfield.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has had an excellent pre-season, while Amorim talked up Mason Mount as a potential option, too. Manuel Ugarte is the frontrunner, though, given the defensive balance he will offer alongside the United captain.",
      "Amorim is keen to add another midfielder to his squad with Carlos Baleba and Morten Hjulmand among the players linked with United.",
      "How pressing a priority that is may be clearer as United pit their wits against an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice, Martin Zubimendi and Martin Odegaard which is arguably among the best in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa and, as of yet, they are yet to win two consecutive games under Amorim.",
      "In fact, they last won consecutive games when they kicked off last season with a 1-0 win over Fulham and that consistency will be something Amorim must address if United are to be successful this season.",
      "United have won on the opening weekend of a Premier League season 22 times, which is more than any other club in the division.",
      "But they are taking on an Arsenal side who are unbeaten in their last 14 away games and unless the match ends in a draw, there may be a buck to one of those trends this evening.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has changed Manchester United's pre-match routine at Old Trafford.",
      "United prepared for home matches by staying overnight in a city centre hotel before travelling to the game, but Erik ten Hag changed the routine following his appointment from Ajax.",
      "Ten Hag made the players arrive at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off. They would arrive individually in their own cars and enjoy a pre-match meal at the stadium. The Dutchman also repurposed a large hospitality suite at Old Trafford and turned it into a pre-match room for his squad.",
      "However, Amorim has decided to scrap that approach, which means the players will now meet at Carrington, eat together at the training ground and travel as a group to Old Trafford.",
      "United have confirmed they will arrive at Old Trafford at 2.45pm to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the decision, Amorim said: “I always had the feeling that we arrive at Old Trafford and Old Trafford must be the centre of the game, but we cannot spend four hours there waiting for the game.",
      "“And I feel with these facilities [at Carrington] we can be here, preparing for the game away from Old Trafford and when we arrive at Old Trafford, we have to feel the fans and then go directly to the game, not killing the momentum of the connection with our fans.",
      "“We know that we have a lot of people waiting there for us, to be with the players and to sign autographs. We will try to do the same.",
      "“So, it's going to be the same experience for the fans. But for us it's going to be better because we are going to feel, nearer the game, the momentum with the fans and we will spend less time in there.”",
      "United unveiled Carrington's £50million makeover ahead of the new season. “I have no doubt that it will positively impact the performance of our teams,” said Omar Berrada.",

      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has issued a message after being linked with a move to Manchester United.",
      "United have been credited with an interest in signing Baleba this summer as they look to strengthen their midfield options before the transfer window closes. The Seagulls are reported to value Baleba at more than £100million and there are even some suggestions that a price tag may be closer to £120million.",
      "A report in The Athletic recently claimed, however, that United were no longer pursuing a deal to sign Baleba this summer. Despite that, the 21-year-old midfielder is continuing to be linked with a big-money move to Old Trafford, even if a potential transfer is not likely to happen until next year.",
      "Amid the speculation, Baleba took to social media to post a message to his 195,000 followers on Instagram. The Seagulls star posted some photos of himself during Brighton's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday.",
      "\"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys,\" wrote Baleba in the caption on his post, which has received more than 10,000 likes.",
      "\"Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba has been handed a new squad number at Brighton for this season. The midfielder wore the No.20 last term and has now been given the No.17 to wear for the Seagulls this term.",
      "United have already been busy in the transfer market this summer with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all moving to Old Trafford. It remains to be seen if United will still look to sign a new midfielder amid news that a move for Baleba will not be possible before the September 1 deadline.",

      "Manchester United's 2025/26 Premier League campaign gets under way later today, with Ruben Amorim's side taking on Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui are all guaranteed to miss out against Arsenal later today, while Andre Onana could return in goal after missing all of pre-season through injury. The last time the two sides met saw the points shared, with Bruno Fernandes getting on the scoresheet in a 1-1 draw.",
      "So, can United kick off the new season with three points? We used EA FC 25 to get a score prediction.",
      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 25 and updated the squads with the latest injuries, suspensions, and transfers. The kits from the 2025/26 season aren't available in EA FC 25, so both sides were lined up in last season's kits, while new transfers may have incorrect squad numbers in-game.",
      "We predict that United could set up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their line-up as follows: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Fernandes, Ugarte, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "We predict that Arsenal could line up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Zubimendi, Rice, Odegaard; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli.",
      "Arsenal started on top at Old Trafford, and they had two big chances to take the lead in the opening 20 minutes, but Viktor Gyokeres was unable to direct any of his close-range efforts on target. They were glaring misses from the Swedish international, and just before half-time, it was the other new striker who scored first.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad combined down the right to skip past the Arsenal defence, with the latter being allowed to run freely into space on the wing. As Gabriel came across to cover, Amad picked out Sesko unmarked in the box, and after cutting onto his left foot, the striker found the net with a curling effort.",
      "After the break, Arsenal took full control of the game, and they managed to level the score in the 66th minute when Andre Onana pushed Gabriel Martinelli's shot into the path of Bukayo Saka, allowing the Englishman to tap into an empty net from close range. With the score level, the Gunners continued to dominate, and in the 91st minute, Mikel Arteta's side were able to turn the game on its head and find a late winner.",
      "A long ball forward sent Gyokeres through on goal, but as he shot, Matthijs de Ligt recovered fantastically to make an important block. The ball fell perfectly for Martinelli, with the Brazilian sending a sweetly struck volley into the far corner to secure the three points late on.",
      "What do you think the final score will be? Let us know in the comments!",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' insistence that there were \"no hard feelings\" when Ruben Amorim left Sporting CP midway through last season was an indication that he was already planning his move.",
      "Amorim made the switch from the Jose Alvalade Stadium to Old Trafford in November last year while Sporting remained at the top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Gyokeres was left to spearhead the team without the manager who had brought him to the club and, despite a rocky period initially, helped the side retain their domestic crown and lift the Taca de Portugal.",
      "Last month, Gyokeres followed his former manager to the Premier League, but chose to sign for rivals Arsenal rather than Amorim's Manchester United. The Swedish forward's £64million transfer fee means he arrives with enormous expectations to deliver under Mikel Arteta as the Gunners look to improve on their second-placed finishes across the last three campaigns.",
      "As if Gyokeres' debut arriving on Sunday against United at Old Trafford wasn't enough pressure, all attention will be on his display against the club and manager he essentially snubbed. Amorim will be aware of the danger the 27-year-old presents, as Gyokeres netted his first goal in an Arsenal shirt during the pre-season victory over Athletic Club last weekend.",
      "And to make the two English powerhouses' 2025/26 Premier League opener even more intriguing, United have since brought in former Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko. There is likely to be a warm embrace between Amorim and Gyokeres despite some Sporting players being upset by the manner of his departure last autumn.",
      "After United forked out £11m to release him from his contract, the 40-year-old tactician did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later, remaining with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League, and Braga.",
      "Following a 4-2 comeback victory in his final match against Braga, wing-back Geny Catamo revealed to Bar Da Liga how devastated the squad felt watching their boss leave after such a triumphant result, explaining: \"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "Gyokeres, whilst acknowledging his sadness at the announcement, emphasised that he held no grudges against the young manager’s decision during an interview with SIC earlier this year.",
      "The forward explained: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Gyokeres’ comments came despite his agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, previously stating Amorim was the main reason his client joined Sporting two summers ago.",
      "Cetinkaya had also revealed that several Premier League clubs were keen on signing the Swedish international last summer following his impressive breakthrough season, but Gyokeres chose to stay due to Amorim remaining at the helm.",
      "His soft stance on Amorim's exit may have also subtly hinted that he was already set on his own move, while his more distraught team-mates knew they'd be staying put. That, coupled with his agent's comments, means it's not surprising that he too decided to leave this summer.",
      "Sunday's fixture provides the perfect opportunity for both Amorim and Gyokeres to prove a point to each other.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

And if you are moaning about Saliba’s non-foul, imagine a scenario where the goal is disallowed but a penalty immediately given for the exact same offence (much worse) by Cunha on Zubimendi. Let the game flow. Let the game be physical. #VARout\nDiaby, Gooner, poor performance but good 3pts",

      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",

      "",
      "19) James Trafford (Burnley to Manchester City, £27m to £31m, July 2025)\nBurnley were claiming this was a British record fee for a goalkeeper while Manchester City were briefing that they had only paid an initial £27m for their former keeper. Any which way, it’s a decent whack of money for an uncapped player. But that status will surely only last so long…he was in the England picture even while in the Championship.",
      "",
      "18) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "16) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "15) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "14) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "13) Jarell Quansah (Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m to £35m, July 2025)\nA winner of the U19 and U21 Euros, having captained England at various levels and been on Gareth Southgate’s standby list for Euro 2024, is destined to make the senior grade at some point.",
      "Quansah was even in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad and Liverpool will be among those keen to monitor how he fares in Germany.",
      "",
      "12) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "11) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "10) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Barca boost for Rashford? Arsenal could sign six players\n👉 Eze to Arsenal and Watkins to Man Utd: Best of the rest reassigned to Premier League big boys",
      "",
      "9) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "8) Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town to Nottingham Forest, £37.5m, August 2025)\nA year after joining Ipswich Town for a doomed year in the Premier League, the Tractor Boys almost doubled their money when Nottingham Forest came calling with a big pile of Anthony Elanga money. He has played for Jamaica but has since switched allegiances back to England, winning the Under-21 Euros in 2024.",
      "",
      "7) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "6) Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa to Newcastle United, £39m to £43m, August 2025)\nIt feels like a lot of money for a player who started just half of Aston Villa’s Premier League games the season before, but then you remember that West Ham paid £40m for…",
      "",
      "5) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Man City have made an offer of £250m for Chelsea superstar Cole Palmer as they look to bring him back to the Etihad Stadium, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been rejected by Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, while Arsenal have decided to ‘distance’ themselves from a deal, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak is ‘training alone’ amid uncertainty over his Newcastle, who have been dealt another huge blow as a second star ‘wants to join’ Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea have turned down a huge bid from Premier League rivals Man City as they look to re-sign Cole Palmer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly bracing themselves for an ‘improved offer’ from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz with Anthony Gordon on their list of replacements."

      "6) Raheem Sterling (Liverpool to Manchester City) – £49m\nJoined Liverpool academy at 15",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and even though we’re only halfway through the opening weekend there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "8=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season; it’s interesting that the bookies give him more chance of keeping up that form than Richarlison.",
      "",
      "6=) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6=) Joao Pedro (0)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning.",
      "",
      "5) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd.",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an opening-day goal. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson thinks Liverpool should be looking to sign another centre-back before worrying about signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle.",
      "Nine Premier League players rank among the top 20 most valuable players in the world. They are joined by only one Paris Saint-Germain star.",
      "Manchester City have the most players in the top 10 as well as the highest-paid player for the 2025-26 Premier League season…"

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",

      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "13) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "8=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "3=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "3=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Arsenal) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Brighton) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Fulham) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Aston Villa) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Chelsea) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Crystal Palace) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Newcastle) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Everton) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Leeds) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Manchester United) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Bournemouth) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Brentford) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” he has at his disposal at Manchester United and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Bayindir was a surprise selection ahead of Andre Onana at Old Trafford and flapped at Declan Rice’s inswinging corner to gift Riccardo Calafiori the easiest chance to score with a header at the back post for the Gunners.",
      "Roy Keane urged the Turkey international to use “violence” to get to the ball ahead of the attacking players and Amorim admits his players – including Bayindir – need to match the aggression of their opponents from set pieces.",
      "“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same,” Amorim said when asked if he was disappointed with the goal. “When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.",
      "“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No, (I’m not saying he should have acted differently) I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball, he chose to get the ball but he didn’t push so he cannot defend it.",
      "“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "When it was suggested Bayindir was at fault, Amorim responded: “He suffered a goal like this (before) when?",
      "And when a reporter reminded him of Tottenham last season, Amorim replied: “But without VAR. With VAR, it’s a foul. And then what happened in the next game against Arsenal? Who saved the penalty? Who saved the game?",
      "“You don’t remember the game, I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one in or the other (goalkeeper). I choose Altay.”",
      "Amorim was then asked about his decision not to include Onana in the squad after the Cameroon international was his No.1 last season.",
      "Amorim said: “I didn’t drop Onana from the squad. It is not the case of dropping Onana. Not putting in Andre Onana after just one week without seeing a game, without time training.",
      "“Tom and Altay, during the pre-season they did a very good job.”",
      "United have been heavily linked with a number of goalkeepers this summer, with Gianluigi Donnarumma’s decision to leave Paris Saint-Germain leading to suggestions he should be targeted.",
      "Pushed on whether he is happy with his current goalkeeping options and if the club need to sign another, Amorim continued: “We proved today that we can win any game in the Premier League. Especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team.",
      "“I’m happy with the players. I’m happy with the three goalkeepers.”",
      "Ruben Amorim has been criticised for a “terrible substitution” in Man Utd’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Roy Keane branded Man Utd ‘weak and soft’ at half-time in their clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford and urged ‘violence’ from one of Ruben Amorim’s players.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s first big call of the season came back to bite him just 13 minutes into Man Utd’s opening game against Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Gary Neville insists that Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is not yet “fully on board” with Kobbie Mainoo being a long-term solution in midfield.",

      "The emotions usually run too high, the resentment too bitter, the rivalry too deep and the bragging rights too enticing for analysis and introspection to override outcome bias.",
      "But a collapsed giant in 15th spending a similar amount to the perennial runners-up to bridge a 32-point gulf in quality, even just in a one-off game, only feeds the narrative of one side finding its feet at the start of a grand rebuild while the other stagnates and struggles to make the final step.",
      "",
      "2) The challenge as ever for Manchester United is to use this platform and these foundations properly.",
      "This was not the calibre of game Amorim’s side failed to show up in last season. He engineered a victory over Manchester City, draws with Liverpool, Arsenal and City and single-goal defeats to Spurs and Chelsea in his few chastening months since being appointed.",
      "It reached the point where a spirited draw at Anfield left the manager “really mad” because “we have to do it against any opponent,” while captain Bruno Fernandes said he “wasn’t worried about people putting in effort today because it’s Liverpool, everyone’s going to try to do their best. I’m more worried about Southampton”.",
      "Amad rescued them with a hat-trick in the final ten minutes of that game but Amorim was breaking televisions against Brighton a few days later and the club’s only Premier League victories from February up to the final day were at home to Ipswich and away at Leicester.",
      "Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.",

      "Liverpool and Manchester City can make their four-goal statements before Arsenal stumble over their words, but the final message was all the same. And Chelsea showed that the title tag can weigh heavy for those unprepared.",
      "The run also goes on: Arsenal remain unbeaten in 22 Premier League games against the rest of the Big Six, dating back two and a half years. It is a phenomenal record.",

      "4) But Mikel Arteta knows that there will come a time when style and substance must amalgamate, when performances and results coalesce. 1-0 to the Arsenal is a fun chant, not a sustainable diet.",
      "The Spaniard’s measured post-match take was heartening, with a healthy balance of satisfaction with the result and contentment with certain aspects of the game, but an acceptance that the standard has to be much higher when the pre-season kinks are ironed out.",
      "“Twenty-two years at Old Trafford without winning before I came,” he said. “Now I go into the dressing room, we won and they’re not happy. It’s a good sign.”",
      "That mentality and the ability to grind out a result will be imperative and routinely ignored by the critics. But Arsenal have to show soon that £200m has been spent to add more feathers to their bow than set pieces in this turbocharged nuclear title war.",
      "",
      "5) Having Viktor Gyokeres up to anything resembling speed would have been useful.",
      "A challenger signing a brutish Scandinavian striker who ostensibly changes their entire style makes the comparison a bit on the nose but no less inevitable when it comes to Erling Haaland.",
      "And 21 touches with four passes completed in an hour really underpinned that same all-or-nothing narrative Gyokeres will bring to the table.",
      "The plan cannot have been for him to have more crosses or clearances than shots, although that neat centre-forward trick of relieving pressure by winning fouls on the halfway line with no teammate within 20 yards will be particularly handy when defending those narrow leads.",
      "But really – and understandably – the team’s instincts of playing with that brand of attacking spearhead were not there and will take time to develop.",
      "There were two moments when he was played in out wide, on either side and in either half, and the Sporting iteration of Gyokeres might have expected to battering ram his way inside before finishing with at least one plomb. But an overhit ball which soared over all three teammates, and a clumsy run which ended with him stepping on the ball in the area and fouling a defender, pointed to a player some way off the pace.",
      "Maybe going on strike to force a move which was always likely to happen and thus missing most of pre-season wasn’t too bright an idea. A shiny penny to whomever is first to ask whether Arsenal are better without him.",

      "The Premier League premium can be excessive but the plug-in-and-play performances of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo showed why clubs charge and pay them.",
      "With no time needed to acclimatise to the league and its demands, an entire attack was transformed. Cunha and Mbeumo had as many shots as Arsenal between them, and more on target. Even Benjamin Sesko looked bright and busy in his cameo.",
      "Worra trophy indeed. And ultimately it did still end with Harry Maguire chucked up front. But it turns out spending £200m on a completely new frontline while loaning out all the previous composite parts can rejuvenate it.",
      "",
      "8) It is not worth contemplating how much needs to be spent fumigating and then rectifying their other glaring problem positions.",
      "The hosts’ midfield was semi-functional. It turns out Casemiro lacks mobility and Bruno Fernandes is often stretched across a few different roles and responsibilities. A more coherent side would have exploited the gaps Mason Mount didn’t frequently drop deep to plug.",
      "But the substitutions were revealing. Kobbie Mainoo was unused and instead Manuel Ugarte was given a half-hour cameo summed up by an atrocious shot from 30 yards out to waste some excellent Sesko link-up play.",
      "Brighton are going to extract a comical amount of money from skint Sir Jim next summer for Carlos Baleba. Whether this midfield can hang on for long enough is unknown.",
      "",
      "9) The goalkeeper situation is untenable. Leaving Andre Onana out was a choice and the justification of him having barely trained after recovering from injury stands up to reason, but when his back-up is inhibited by the exact same issues of reliability to the extent that conceding a corner is tantamount to conceding a goal regardless of who stands between the posts, investing hundreds of millions on forwards is pointless.",
      "Altay Bayindir had almost nothing to do besides – certainly in terms of saves – but flapping at that corner was a game-changing moment.",
      "",
      "10) It did not help that early in the second half, when Cunha had purchased one of his many fouls from William Saliba by the corner flag, David Raya confidently and competently punched the delivery away despite being pinned on his line among a raft of bodies.",
      "The way Raya has transitioned to becoming a genuinely brilliant keeper is not spoken of often enough, nor how Arteta absolutely nailed such a ruthless decision.",
      "There were a couple of shaky moments on the ball in his own area but also some fine saves from a man starting his hunt for a third consecutive Golden Glove in decent fettle.",
      "",
      "11) That sort of brutal, cutthroat call really might need to be made on Arsenal’s left wing at some point. If Gyokeres is going to be slightly detached from team play and judged on the quality and decisiveness of his touches rather than volume, Gabriel Martinelli cannot afford to do similar.",
      "It surely wasn’t by design that two-thirds of Arsenal’s attack were isolated but Martinelli had even fewer touches and completed passes than Gyokeres despite not even being close to the sort of peripheral player in the link-up who comes alive in front of goal.",
      "One quick break collapsed due to the Brazilian’s dreadful pass, while his opportunities to test Bayindir were snatched and wasted.",
      "Arsenal could charge a sizeable rent based on the room for improvement in that position; it really could hold them back.",

      "12) Mbeumo was electric from the first minute, when his combination of sublime touch and forearm into Martin Zubimendi’s face drew roars from the crowd.",
      "He earned bookings for both the left-backs he faced, pulled out an overhead kick and looked like he belonged.",
      "Cunha was arguably even better and that dribble from midway inside his own half through three opponents to manufacture a shot must have been manna to supporters who didn’t realise forwards were allowed to do such things.",
      "Their character and instincts are a massive upgrade on what came before. Fernandes has finally been relieved of that attacking burden, albeit at great expense.",
      "",
      "13) But where the captain fits on this ship is unknown as the issues in slotting him into this system persist. His midfield pairing with Casemiro is not viable and the duty he has to drop deep in the build up is not always beneficial.",
      "The corner Arsenal scored from was conceded unnecessarily when Fernandes played a six-yard pass backwards to Leny Yoro inside his own area as the centre-half was being closed down in plain view. Bayindir, Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu were guilty of similarly careless turnovers of possession in dangerous areas.",
      "Fernandes still created five chances because that’s what he does, but maybe £100m in exchange for a brilliant but incongruous 30-year-old wasn’t the worst deal.",
      "",
      "14) A key difference between Arsenal’s first and second-half performances could be seen through the prism of Martin Odegaard, who capitalised on those midfield spaces to complete the most take-ons of any player in the opening 45 minutes with three.",
      "Those chances were squandered but Manchester United were struggling to cope at times with his dribbling.",
      "",
      "15) Matthijs de Ligt was really good. In both boxes actually. That late block on Bukayo Saka was exceptional. He might yet start successive seasons under the same coach, the lucky sod.",

      "Ruben Amorim denied us the ‘battle of the new No.9s’ we were after from the off at Old Trafford, with Benjamin Sesko’s introduction after 65 minutes meaning he and Viktor Gyokeres were never on the pitch at the same time.",
      "And yet, we still got we wanted: the opportunity for a knee-jerk reaction. Gyokeres was – and therefore is – rubbish.",
      "He was hooked on the hour mark and deservedly so having bumbled around the pitch with the grace and skill of a pub player. His best moment of the game was a shoulder barge on Matthijs de Ligt which sent the Manchester United centre-back flying and was reposted roughly a billion times by Arsenal fans desperate for some sign of worth from their £55m ‘final piece’.",
      "Apart from that his first Arsenal outing consisted of quite a lot of running about, dodgy touches and a complete lack of goal threat. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he trod on the ball.",
      "He had no shots, completed no dribbles, made 11 passes, attempted no tackles and won one aerial duel before being replaced by Kai Havertz, who will be starting ahead of him before long if there isn’t a massive improvement. By Christmas at the latest, as one particularly astute F365er predicted.",
      "Arsenal spent most of the summer deciding between Sesko and Gyokeres and although Manchester United’s shiny new striker touched the ball just seven times in his 30-odd minutes, there were good signs from the guy Andrea Berta opted against.",
      "He had two half-chances, both fairly weak headers, but at least he was in position. And there were several moments in the first half as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha broke on Arsenal when it looked as though they were a £74m striker short of getting back into the game.",
      "Arsenal fans will blame the service to Gyokeres at Old Trafford – and they’re right to – but there’s also a sense that this was the sort of game, in which Mikel Arteta’s side weren’t particularly dominant, when there was space in behind the United defence, in which Gyokeres could have made a real difference with his famous barrelling runs, with or without the ball.",
      "Sure, he didn’t have much of a pre-season, the link between him and the midfield will take time and none of his fellow Arsenal forwards were anywhere near their best – Gabriel Martinelli completed five passes in his 60 minutes, FFS – but Gunners fans hoping for their Erling Haaland instead got a below-par Salomon Rondon.",
      "This was the first game since Gyokeres left Coventry that he hasn’t managed a shot on goal and on his Premier League debut at Old Trafford he looked far more like the guy who scored seven fewer Championship goals than Chuba Akpom in his last season in English football than the guy who’s got 97 in 102 games for Sporting since.",
      "After just half an hour, you can see how Sesko fits at Manchester United, in stark contrast to Gyokeres and Arsenal, for whom it is perhaps the unsuitability that’s as big a worry as anything.",
      "Gyokeres makes runs into the channel and Arsenal don’t play those passes. It’s a learning curve for him and his teammates, obviously, but that’s a difficult bond to forge during the season when Gyokeres’ qualities are so vastly different to those of Havertz or any of the other strikers who have led their line under Arteta.",

      "As the away side, Arsenal at least have some excuse for being pretty boring and uninspired after Altay Bayindir placed a pretty routine down-the-throat corner directly onto the head of Riccardo Calafiori, who we swear laughed as he gently nuzzled it over the line with as much force as it takes to go nose-to-snout with a big stupid friendly labrador.",
      "Still, we had hoped for more from them – some sense that they might have upped their game from last season, or that they were keen to see what Viktor Gyokeres could actually do if they, you know, gave him the ball in front of goal or something. Feels a bit weird to cry out for a good centre-forward and then pretend he doesn’t exist – not that he especially helped himself when the ball did come his way. Maybe another day.",
      "We are left once again that Arteta has grown much too conservative for his own good. With the home crowd deflated by that all-too-familiar route to goal, United were there to be got at again. Kill the game off, lads? Nah. But hey: they won on the road, so fine. Chalk it up as a rugged, resilient victory.",

      "Manchester United meanwhile…well, they were clearly better than Arsenal for much of the game, but to come from a goal behind, they had to be a lot better. It turns out playing nine of the side that stank the Premier League out last season plus the actually-good Bryan Mbeumo and Mattheus Cunha still isn’t a vast improvement. Better, but not great.",
      "United fans have continued reason to feel frustrated about that. For us as neutrals, though, their greatest sin in the nine-month old Ruben Amorim era is just how persistently dull they are for such long spells of games.",
      "The repeated errors Bayindir and Andre Onana have committed in that time as a valid talking point, but the criticism has been amplified by the fact that United have so rarely given us hacks anyone else of note to talk about. They only continue to call Old Trafford the Theatre of Dreams because it’s been a fantastic place to go to catch up on your sleep.",
      "Here, Mattheus Cunha was the only United player to bring any kind of verve to the side in the first half. Seeing Cunha driving his way through the entire Arsenal defence several times in the first half was particularly fun, and it took a stupendous reaction save from David Raya to keep Arsenal in front as the former Wolves man shot from a narrow angle.",
      "It wasn’t until the final half hour that United really started to click into gear. They can take some encouragement from that; it’s something, anyway.",
      "Mbeumo looked especially bright in the second half, and helped inspire United into finishing the game strongly. Amorim’s side showed quite a bit more promise here than they did at almost any other point last season. Cunha, Mbeumo and ever-dynamic substitute Amad should have better luck against less defensively capable sides than Arsenal – which, in total fairness, is basically everybody in this division.",
      "Until we see that happen, though, promise is all it is, and there is clearly still plenty more work to be done in the transfer market – particularly between the sticks.",
      "There have been plenty of other sides who have not been anything like their best and have issues to address: Liverpool, Newcastle, Villa.",
      "But for the sake of our continued sanity over the course of the season, it is United and Arsenal we most want to see raise their game and show us something more."

      "However, a triple swoop for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha has many predicting a better season for the Red Devils.",
      "There are also rumours surrounding a potential move for Carlos Baleba, so it’s clear to see that Amorim has been backed from the boardroom, but the real question is whether he can succeed where many predecessors have failed and transfer that on to the pitch.",

      "Arsenal will be a tough test and they have also had a transformative summer in terms of recruitment.",

      "As always this fixture promises to be a fascinating prospect and you can follow it on our live score centre.",
      "",
      "Sesko will likely make his debut after signing from RB Leipzig last week, while Mbeumo and Cunha will likely start for Amorim’s side.",

      "We get the sense that Ruben Amorim will be looking forward to Manchester United’s opening-day clash with Arsenal far more than Mikel Arteta, for whom anything other than a win at Old Trafford will result in some gloriously early sack chat.",
      "Here are five reasons why a trip to Old Trafford is a nightmare first fixture for Arteta…",
      "",
      "Polar expectations\nEven a couple of seasons ago, Mikel Arteta would have been praised to the hilt for beating Manchester United on their own patch on the opening day of a season; even a draw would have been commendable.",
      "But this is the worst Manchester United team in living memory, or at least it was last season, when the 1-1 draw in the same fixture saw Arsenal described as ‘utter toss’, with Arteta condemned for his ‘Tony Pulis tribute act’. It’s no longer acceptable for Arsenal to do anything but beat Manchester United.",
      "Only one of us reckons Arsenal will win the Premier League, which is as much to do with our burgeoning lack of faith in Arteta to get the job done as much as anything, but they were in all of our top fours, while the only shred of positivity for United to be found in our pre-season predictions came from our resident Red Devils fan Ian Watson, who believes ‘they will be a lot less sh*te if they get a midfielder with legs and a competent goalkeeper’.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres vs Ruben Amorim\nWe’re bracing ourselves ahead of a fixture featuring a new £70m striker per club, both of whom were heavily linked with the other before making their moves to grant us the delicious prospect of immediate knee-jerking into labelling one a genius and the other a flop amid gloating and gnashing of teeth depending on your red allegiance, for Arsenal and Manchester United to start with Kai Havertz and Rasmus Hojlund up front. We beg you – give the people what they want.",
      "At this stage we would be picking one over the other through a flip of a coin, which doesn’t appear to be far off Arsenal’s strategy. But we do predict Gyokeres will have the tougher time on Sunday.",
      "That’s again partly down to expectation – Gyokeres is ‘the final piece of the puzzle’ for Arsenal, who needs to drive them to the title, whereas Benjamin Sesko has a laughably low bar to clear in order to be a dramatic improvement up front for United.",
      "But there’s also no manager who knows what Gyokeres is capable of – and therefore in an excellent position to stop him –  better than Ruben Amorim, without whom the Sweden international would not have got his dream move to Arsenal. Whether the United defenders are able to carry out Amorim’s orders is another matter.",
      "",
      "Manchester United might actually be quite good\nThe defence looks pretty good though. They’ve conceded just five goals in five pre-season games and that area of the pitch was rarely picked out as a problem under Amorim last season. Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven looks to be a nice mix of experience and youth to rotate in the three centre-back positions.",
      "There have been good signs from Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon on the left in pre-season, while Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot provide very different but decent options on the right. The midfield is the obvious concern as Manuel Ugarte hasn’t got near to proving himself capable of granting United enough stability alongside Bruno Fernandes, hence the interest in Carlos Baleba as a ‘perfect’ fit for that role, at odds with the imperfect Kobbie Mainoo and the formerly perfect Casemiro. And sure, we’re also far from convinced by Andre Onana.",
      "That front three could be a real handful though. It’s about as good a trio as Amorim could have hoped for now that United aren’t able to fish in that top pool of talent. The dynamism and hunger to succeed feels like the big thing among all three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with the deep-seated love of Manchester United (or at least greater love for them than Newcastle) key to Amorim’s desire to sign them.",
      "And while an entirely new forward line could be a problem for United, with the relationship between them not yet embedded, it also makes it very difficult for Arteta to prepare his team as he has no idea what to expect from them.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim might actually be quite good\nIt became easy to forget as Amorim lost game after to game to drum up the worst record of any Manchester United manager in the Premier League era last season that he didn’t want to be Manchester United manager last season.",
      "He made it very clear to Omar Berrada when he approached Sporting that his preference was to stay in Portugal and take over at Old Trafford this summer, and said the same again when he was unveiled as the new Red Devils boss, revealing he was forced into a corner by Berrada’s “now or never” ultimatum.",
      "He made a compelling case for not arriving mid-season being the right course of action, admitting on several occasions last term amid some quite extraordinary sack pressure that he may not be the man for the job while many of us queried his unwavering belief in his principles and style of football.",
      "But he’s still here, with his reputation largely intact, after a pre-season he craved to bed in ideas which worked so brilliantly at Sporting and now at least have a serviceable chance of proving successful at United.",
      "There’s a sense of no harm done about Amorim at United. He’s got rid of or sidelined the ‘bad apples’, got a few of his players in and has had time to work with a squad which crucially (hopefully) knows what the end goal is. Could we about to see a ‘new manager bounce’ from someone who’s already been in the job for nine months?",
      "",
      "Or Arsenal might be a bit sh*t?\nWe’re thinking more about the post-match reaction here. We don’t think Arsenal are sh*t, nor do we think they will be sh*t in this game. But, because we will have no barometer for how good Manchester United are, no other games to provide context for their quality, we suspect most fans and pundits will see a United victory as proof that Arsenal have no chance of winning the title rather than say, proving Ruben Amorim’s side could qualify for Europe.",
      "If in doubt, football stakeholders take the path of pessimism, and it’s far more fun to suggest Arteta’s set for the sack than Amorim might be an alright manager, actually.",
      "Arsenal beat Manchester United but it’s the Gunners who get an absolute kicking from the fans while Man Utd are optimistic.",
      "Halfway through the first weekend of the new Premier League season and we already have a brand new favourite in the Sack Race. It’s a brutal game.",
      "Ruben Amorim insists he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” at Man Utd and defended Altay Bayindir after his blunder saw them lose to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo humbled Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres in the war of the debutants but Manchester United may be reconsidering that £100m Bruno Fernandes call.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been criticised for a “terrible substitution” in Man Utd’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s first big call of the season came back to bite him just 13 minutes into Man Utd’s opening game against Arsenal."

      "Man Utd were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in their opening Premier League game of the season; an error from Altay Bayindir led to Riccardo Calafirori's goal; Andre Onana was not in the matchday squad; Gary Neville says Man Utd need a goalkeeper, with Emi Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma linked",
      "Monday 18 August 2025 06:51, UK",
      "The stopper replaced formerly regular first choice Andre Onana - who was not in the match squad - but failed to stop a Declan Rice cross that was then nodded home by Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Despite an improved attacking performance from Man Utd, they were unable to answer the 13th-minute strike, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya given the player of the match award by Neville.",
      "The game highlighted the difference in quality of goalkeepers between the two sides, and the former Man Utd defender is adamant that Ruben Amorim must sign a new stopper.",
      "On the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"There's a glaring issue that Man Utd cannot ignore and it is the fact they need to find a goalkeeper.",
      "\"They have to. I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes.",
      "\"I don't know where they are on PSR, but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan.",
      "\"The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters.",
      "\"You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina.",
      "\"They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man Utd need that.",
      "\"There are a number of things Man Utd need this season and Amorim is getting to that point now where he thinks he's got a team that could do something.",
      "\"However, they need to sort the goalkeeper because they concede goals and lose points, and it continually undermines what you are doing.",
      "\"When the goalkeeper is flapping at the ball, those 72,000 home fans are groaning and that sends a shiver through the spines of defenders. It also sends a shiver through the goalkeeper and creates an anxiety around the stadium.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position, and Man Utd are going to have to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim also has veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton at his disposal, but would not be drawn on whether he is looking to sign another stopper before the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"We need to focus and forget about the noise. We're fighting for places and that's a good thing. It doesn't matter who is playing, we want to win games.\"",
      "Reflecting on the goal, the coach defended Bayindir, adding: \"[It was] more or less the same thing that happened at times last season.",
      "\"For me, it's not playing the ball, it's protecting the guys they're attacking. I understand that we want goals but when you're touching the goalkeeper in that way, I think it's hard. To lose with a goal like this is hard.",
      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",

      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",

      "\"Arsenal were never at their best but to come to Manchester, whether it is Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, it's always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.",
      "\"The Manchester United players look dejected. They are on the floor but if they keep up this level of performance, which is the big question, they will win a lot of points this season.",
      "\"I thought they did a fair few decent things out there but Arsenal were strong, and that set piece in the first half was the big difference in the game.\"",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home. We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",

      "Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.",

      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",
      "Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.",
      "Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter",
      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",
      "A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
      "If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter",
