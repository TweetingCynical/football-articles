      "Former Manchester United and Tottenham star Dimitar Berbatov was once held hostage in a bid to force him to swap clubs.",
      "The former Bulgaria international was just a teenage in his homeland, plying his trade for CSKA Sofia when the incident happened. Berbatov, who joined United from Spurs for £30.75m in 2008, was taken to a restaurant by a team-mate after training, Once there, he was accosted by a group of men - believed to be henchmen of gangster Georgi Iliev - and held captive for several hours as they looked to force him to move to a rival.",
      "Berbatov, who starred in the Premier League, also appearing for Fulham, told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"I was playing for CSKA Sofia and I was really starting to show my qualities. And normally, when you show your quality as a player, teams will come for you, submit offers, ask, you know, how long do you have as a contract, how much do you cost to buy, and stuff like this.",
      "\"But back home was more different. Back home it was like, 'Him? All right, bring him here.",
      "\"I didn't have a car. So a teammate of mine, after training, he was like, 'come with me, I need to bring you to a friend of mine.' And I was a bit naive, of course. And maybe I trusted him because we played in the same team. So I get into his car. He drove me to a restaurant.",
      "\"We get into the restaurant, and in the restaurant there were obviously tables. And on one table, there was a guy by himself. And on three other tables, there were big guys, refrigerators, typical Balkan guys sitting behind him, just looking scary.",
      "\"And the guy who brought me there was like, 'go over there, sit, I’ll see you later.' And the guy was like, 'come here, sit down.'",
      "\"I'm sitting down, and it's like, thinking to myself in my mind, 'what is going on? What is going on? I need to call my dad, I need to call my dad.'",
      "\"And the guy started talking. He's like, 'do you know what they call me?' Now, in English, it’s going to be like, the word probably is going to be, they call me the cook.",
      "\"I'm like, all right. 'So we know about you. We need to change the team. We want you in our team. We need to get you.' And I’m like, “'yeah, but I'm playing in CSKA Sofia. I mean, I like it there.'",
      "\"He said, 'we will figure that out. Don't worry about it.' And the guys were sitting there and I’m just like this, you know, intimidated, of course. So maybe two, three hours sitting there, and in the end, the guy let me call my dad.",
      "\"And I'm like calling my dad, 'I'm here. I don’t know where I am. You know, the people around me, big guys.' You know, I was talking really fast, and he’s like, 'calm down, breathe. Like, just calm down and just breathe.'",
      "\"And I'm like, 'what the f**k? They're going to kidnap me here and I don't want to go, I want to go home.' And he’s like, 'OK, OK. Let me see what I can do. I'll call the guy.' So eventually someone calls someone, and the big bosses of the two teams figure out a way of me not moving, just staying where I was.",
      "\"And in that situation, 18 years old, seeing and knowing how things were done back then in Bulgaria, I was thinking to myself, 'this is it for me. Maybe they’re going to beat me, or I don't know, you know'.",
      "\"But eventually my dad came in and took me in the car, and I was like, 'oh my God.' Makes me realise I need to grow up quick and be a man really early in my stage of life.\"",

Berbatov admits he felt speechless and paralysed when Fergie told him he wouldn't even be on the bench for the showpiece game against Barcelona at Wembley in 2011.",

      "\"The boss said, 'Well, you're not playing. It's very difficult for me to say. It pains me to say it, but you're not playing today'. And I'm like, in my mind, 'All right, I'm on the bench. Am I on the bench?'",
      "\"'No, no, you're not playing. You're not in the squad'. And in a moment like this, even if you're strong, even if you're a man, you can be paralysed like I was.",

      "\"I just felt worthless. I changed my mind and I stayed. But I watched the game in the dressing room. So it was one of the most difficult points of my career. But after a while, the boss just apologised. And when I asked him to do the foreword for my book, he wrote it inside it. It was a mistake.\"",

      "After a stint at Aston Villa last season, Rashford was keen to leave Old Trafford and, finally, got his wish when he secured a switch to the Camp Nou. Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has netted five goals and provided seven assists, including one in their recent 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid in El Clasico, while his performances for the La Liga giants have drawn comments from Saha.",
      "\"I've always been a fan of Marcus Rashford; his quality is amazing. I was even jealous of his talent, and he's a nice guy,\" Saha told BetVictor.",
      "\"However, I don't like the narrative where a player leaves a club like Man Utd, and performs better elsewhere, and then blames United for previous struggles. As a professional, you need to find solutions, regardless of whether the manager likes you.",
      "\"We all face moments where we have to perform on the field. That wasn't his response.",

      "Former Manchester United No.1 Andre Onana appeared to aim a subtle dig at his Old Trafford colleagues when reflecting on his start at Trabzonspor. The Cameroon international moved on loan to Turkey after falling out of favour with United and has enjoyed four straight wins with his new club.",
      "Trabzonspor sit second in the Super Lig with 23 points, picking up 13 of those in Onana's six outings between the sticks. While the move is only a loan at first, the ex-Inter Milan man could end up completing a permanent move in 2026.",
      "Certainly, Senne Lammens has impressed so far as he makes his case to remain United's first choice for the present and future. Onana, meanwhile, appears far happier with his current team-mates.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has praised Onana for his play with ball at feet on multiple occasions. Responding to that praise, the keeper pointed to the value his colleagues play in allowing him to take the approach he does.",
      "\"As I always say, most of the time, it’s my teammates who give me the options when I’m building up the game,\" he said, per Sporx (via Sport Witness). \"If they help me, the work looks much better.”",
      "The comments could be read as an implication that he didn't receive the same kind of help at United. While Onana came in for criticism for some high-profile errors unrelated to playing out from the back, United's defensive struggles were well documented.",
      "In Onana's two seasons between the sticks, the Red Devils conceded 58 and 54 goals respectively. They had only conceded more than 50 goals in two other seasons in the Premier League era, though one of those instances came in the 2021/22 campaign with some of the same defenders who are at the club now.",
      "Reflecting more widely on his approach, Onana said: “If I have to create a play, I analyse it first. Are the opponents pressing, are they pressing with their wingers, are they pressing with their strikers, or are their centre-backs coming forward?",
      "“These are the things I need to see when I have the ball. I watch how the opponents are moving and then I look at the options and make my decision. Of course, it’s always great to hear a comment like that from Pep Guardiola. He’s one of the best managers in the history of football.\"",
      "With just seven goals conceded in 10 games, Onana's Trabzonspor side boast one of the better defensive records in Turkey. His parent club have conceded 14 goals in their nine league games - three in three with Lammens in goal and 11 in six with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",

      "Brendan Rodgers picked a fight he could never win. Just like Sir Alex Ferguson did more than two decades ago.",
      "Because those who take on Irish businessman Dermot Desmond, tend to finish on the losing side. Just like Rodgers has now, having left Celtic with his managerial reputation in ruins.",
      "But no-one should be surprised how Desmond, the most powerful figure at Celtic, decided to unleash a brutal character assassination on Rodgers. Because Desmond doesn't suffer fools. Back in the Noughties, Desmond was a significant shareholder at Manchester United when he found himself embroiled in what became an infamous row between Fergie and fellow Irishman businessman John Magnier.",
      "The protracted and public dispute was over the ownership of stallion 'Rock Of Gibraltar'. Fergie had been given a half share of the horse, which went on to become a champion one.",
      "Fergie believed his share was worth more than what Magnier, and his Coolmore bloodstock empire, were willing to give him. The dispute, which started in 2003 when Fergie was managing United, resulted in Magnier putting pressure on the club, by questioning some of their past transfer dealings and agents involved in them.",
      "These included Fergie's son, Jason Ferguson. Ferguson launched legal proceedings, while United supporters protested against Magnier, and threatened to disrupt the Cheltenham Festival.",
      "But the dispute was resolved once Desmond agreed to act as peacemaker. Which resulted in Fergie getting a settlement much lower than what he had asked for. With help from Desmond, Magnier had won.",
      "Desmond gets what he wants, in the end. A fact Rodgers is now coming to realise.",
      "Desmond operates in the margins, with stealth. He is someone who believes business should be done with discretion. He makes all the big calls - and doesn't feel the need to have to explain them.",
      "But he has taken the unusual step of making an exception for Rodgers. Accusing the former Liverpool manager of speaking words which \"have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club, fuelling \"hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\"",
      "In short, whatever Rodgers has done, it has persuaded Desmond to go nuclear on him. It's difficult to see where Rodgers goes from here.",
      "He might even feel like taking legal action himself, just like Fergie did all those years ago. But then again, he might want to think long and hard about that.",

      "No sooner had Jadon Sancho been taken off the pitch during the Man City match than a flurry of comments flooded social media, suggesting the winger should feel embarrassed or that his career had reached a new nadir. Sadly, these extreme reactions were to be expected.",
      "Many outsiders were also prematurely anticipating a failed loan spell for Marcus Rashford months before it even kicked off. A dream transfer to Barcelona was next for forward, whose resurgence in form - thanks to his stint at Villa - can only enhance England's prospects of winning the World Cup next year.",
      "At present, Sancho is not at the same fitness level as Rashford was when he signed with Villa back in February, but this is a season-long loan. The 25-year-old still has ample time to demonstrate his worth.",
      "A quick scroll of social media indicates that Sancho has more than just Emery to impress. However, it's crucial he maintains a laser-like focus, like Rashford, concentrating on the task at hand and disregarding external pressures.",
      "Sancho had a chat with Rashford last season, with the former Villa loanee expressing his delight at finding himself again at a club willing to offer the platform he needed.",
      "Sancho's situation mirrors this closely, and he will be scrutinised intensely during his tenure at Villa - a fact not uncommon for any Manchester United player or one who has previously commanded a hefty transfer fee. Frankly, it's part and parcel of the job.",
      "Some things, however, need perspective - Sancho’s performance against City is one of them.",
      "Sancho was called into action in the 29th minute, replacing Emi Buendia who had suffered a foot injury shortly after setting up Matty Cash's goal.",
      "Operating from the left flank in his fifth loan appearance for Villa, Sancho nearly got on the scoresheet in the second half. A well-timed run onto Boubacar Kamara's lofted pass saw him leave Matheus Nunes trailing in his wake, before forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian shot-stopper was again called into action to deny the rebound.",
      "Just four minutes after almost doubling Villa's lead, Sancho made way for Evann Guessand, whose work rate off the ball was required at that stage of the match.",
      "Despite Sancho being brought on earlier than expected due to Buendia's injury, Unai Emery, like all top managers, prioritised the team's needs and made the necessary changes to secure victory.",
      "Guessand came on, along with Ross Barkley who replaced John McGinn. Both substitutes performed admirably, easing pressure on the defence and fulfilling their roles - much like Sancho did during his 45-minute stint.",
      "Naturally, no player wants to be subbed off after coming on as a substitute, but Emery's intention was always to give Sancho some game time. It just so happened that his introduction came sooner than planned.",
      "In fact, there have been nine other occasions when Emery has 'subbed the sub', with Morgan Rogers, Leon Bailey, Moussa Diaby, and Buendia among them. Did anyone really bat an eyelid when those substitutions were made?",
      "Villa beat Man City at home for a third successive season. Sancho played his part, is looking sharper and fitter, yet the narrative was predictably polarising - yearning for an instant reaction before Emery had even shaken Guardiola's hand or spoken at the press conference.",
      "Asked about the substitution, Emery said: \"It was not easy, firstly, after Sancho played 60 minutes against Go Ahead. He is getting fit, but not enough.",
      "\"I planned as well with him to play him in the second half, but after the injury to Buendia, I decided to get him on the field as best as possible to get minutes and fitness, using his skills and qualities.",
      "\"His impact was good, but I knew before that it was my plan was to sub him, and I did it before with Morgan Rogers and Emi Buendia.",
      "\"It was not a punishment, it was a plan - he played 45 minutes. The other sub players were ready. Malen, Maatsen and Barkley were all very good.\"",

      "\"Marc Guehi is definitely a top player and a leader. I love him as a player,\" Saha told BetVictor. \"It's simple: if Man Utd can hijack the deal to Liverpool, even by paying £20million more than his market price, do it.",
      "\"I think he's a terrific player. I really like his consistency and the security he provides.",
      "\"I also appreciate his communication, he's a very reliable player. He will undoubtedly be part of a huge team and play for significant stakes in the future.\"",
      "In the summer of 2024, United made the decision to bring on board both Leny Yoro and Matthijs De Ligt to bolster their centre-back options, while Ayden Heaven was also snapped up from Arsenal.",
      "Harry Maguire's contract is due to run out at the end of the season, whilst Lisandro Martinez is still on the mend from a long-term knee injury.",

      "His departure from United had been brewing since he voiced his disappointment at Amorim's decision to bench him for May's Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Earlier in the season, Ruben Amorim also felt Garnacho wasn't paying heed to instructions when he was about to be subbed in late during a Europa League match against Viktoria Plzen.",
      "Having joined the Red Devils from Atletico Madrid in 2020, Garnacho spent pre-season training away from United's first team after expressing his wish to leave.",

      "Garnacho, who has made four appearances in the Premier League this season and scored his only goal against Sunderland at the weekend, expressed no regrets about his move. He said: \"At 10 years old, I moved to Atletico Madrid. I was there for five years before I moved to England, and I'm very happy to play here.",

      "And, heck, said challenge has even proved too much for some of the managers that have come and gone from Old Trafford.",

      "Ten Hag's sacking marked a gloomy period for many associated with the club for various reasons. It suggested United may have made a mistake in retaining the manager despite his FA Cup victory over Manchester City just months before, with the team languishing in 14th place in the Premier League at the time of his departure.",
      "Many fans had hoped for success after the excitement of that Wembley win. Instead, the same dreary atmosphere persisted around the team, who fell back into their old habits of struggling for consistent results.",
      "However, Fernandes, who was appointed United captain by Ten Hag in July 2023, was the first to step forward. The Portugal midfielder displayed pure class as he bade farewell to the outgoing manager.",
      "\"Thanks for everything boss! I appreciate the trust and the moments we share (sic) together,\" he wrote on Instagram, accompanied by the raised hands emoji. \"I wish you all the best in the future.",
      "\"Even knowing the last period hasn't been great from all of us I hope you fans can keep with you the good things the manager has done for our club!\"",
      "Despite the inevitable focus on the negatives of a departing manager, United experienced some highs under Ten Hag. He was just one victory away from securing a cup double in his first season, bagging the League Cup and narrowly missing out in the 2023 FA Cup final to City.",
      "It's also worth mentioning United finished third in the league during Ten Hag's inaugural campaign. However, a dramatic fall to eighth place the following season played a significant role in his dismissal.",
      "Fernandes would have developed a unique bond with the man who gave him the captain's armband at Old Trafford. And the 31-year-old had reason to be hopeful with the appointment of fellow Sporting CP graduate Ruben Amorim as his successor.",

      "Rio Ferdinand claims Ruben Amorim is playing \"Russian Roulette with his job\" as he refuses to change at Manchester United - which is now yielding results after a period of turmoil.",
      "The Portuguese boss has been under the spotlight for much of the year he's been in his post, presiding over their worst ever Premier League campaign last term. A consistent talking point has been Amorim's 3-4-3 system, which he's refused to veer from despite the number of defeats.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has defended his system when its been cited as the key issue during United's poor run, even suggesting United should sack him if they want to see a different way of playing.",
      "His refusal to veer from his philosophy has paid off in more recent weeks. After beating Sunderland prior to the international break the team returned and stunned Liverpool at Anfield. That was the first time they'd won successive Premier League games under Amorim and they've since made it three on the bounce.",
      "Ferdinand admits there is something to admire about Amorim's loyalty to his beliefs, but equally accepts it could have gone horribly wrong that he not begun getting results.",
      "He said on the latest episode of Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"I admire it to a certain extent, but, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don't think he's changed drastically, he's just tweaked. That's what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you've got. Maybe don't be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven't got the ball.",
      "\"You can't press, press, press for 90 minutes, unless you're an absolute beast of a team. PSG do it. This manager couldn't do that with this squad.",
      "\"That's just sometimes how the cookie crumbles. We might look back in six months and, say Man United finish in the Champions League or something like that, he'll probably sit there confidently and go, 'Well, if I did change, I probably would be out of a job because I have been doing things that are alien to me'.\"",
      "United's upturn in form has seen them win four of their last five and push them up to sixth in the table - level on points with Manchester City. They've leapfrogged Liverpool amid their poor run of results with Amorim's side now part of the European conversation.",

But the 12 months since haven’t exactly gone according to plan for the Portuguese manager.",
      "Having inherited a squad of players not of his choosing, who struggled to adapt to his preferred 3-4-2-1 formation, Amorim's Red Devils ended up in a dismal 15th place in the Premier League last season - the club's worst-ever finish. To add insult to injury, they were also beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham, missing out on a Champions League spot.",
      "The start of the current 2025/26 season had been equally difficult, until recently when United managed back-to-back wins for the first time under Amorim, beating Sunderland and Liverpool, followed by a 4-2 victory over Brighton last Saturday.",
      "Now sitting in sixth place, things might finally be falling into place for the Old Trafford side. A significant part of this turnaround has been Amorim's ruthless approach to his squad, showing the door to those who don't fit his tactical ideas or simply lack the right attitude.",
      "Two such players are Marcus Rashford, on loan at Barcelona since the summer, and Antony, who signed for Real Betis after a successful loan spell there last season. Interestingly, former manager Ten Hag reportedly believed the pair had let him down throughout his tenure.",
      "According to the Daily Star, Ten Hag felt that Rashford, Antony and Casemiro had all underperformed significantly during his tenure, contributing to his eventual downfall.",
      "Rashford in particular managed to net only once in the league last season under Ten Hag and consistently underperformed at the start of the campaign. The prolonged slump in form of a previously prolific striker left Ten Hag without a reliable goal-scorer, the player having netted 17 times (30 across all competitions) during Ten Hag's inaugural season.",
      "Antony was specifically brought in by Ten Hag for a hefty £86m, with hopes that he would replicate his Ajax performances under the same manager. However, he fell far short of justifying such a price tag, tarnishing Ten Hag's transfer record.",
      "Casemiro also saw a dip in form after an impressive first season at Old Trafford, with his fitness levels dropping and several costly errors not helping Ten Hag's cause.",
      "Amorim seemed to share Ten Hag's sentiments, having frozen out Rashford less than two months into his tenure and loaning both him and Antony out in January. Of the trio, only Casemiro remains in the picture.",
      "Despite being in the twilight of his career at 33, Casemiro remains a dedicated professional, making significant contributions to United's campaign last season. The Brazilian midfielder was instrumental in the latter stages of the Europa League, scoring vital goals.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder also played the majority of minutes in United’s last three Premier League matches, which all ended in wins, scoring and assisting against Brighton. Unlike the aforementioned duo, the five-time Champions League winner still has the chance to play a key role in United’s potential resurgence under Amorim.",

      "The Portuguese coach dismissed that notion, but admitted it was among the toughest jobs in football, noting that several talented and experienced managers before him had tried - and failed - to restore the club to its former glory.",
      "\"You have here different types of coaches: the guys that won everything like Van Gaal and Mourinho, the new ones that knew the club inside out like Solskjaer, then one of the best outside the top five leagues - Ten Hag,\" Amorim said.",

      "It's been exactly a year since Ten Hag was dismissed by United. During just over two years in charge, the former Ajax boss ended the club's long wait for silverware, lifting both the FA Cup and the League Cup. Yet his reign was ultimately defined by inconsistency.",
      "Flashes of promise were too often overshadowed by prolonged dips in form - and by 2024 Ten Hag was fighting to keep his job. A surprise FA Cup final victory over Manchester City merely delayed the inevitable, with the Dutchman finally dismissed following United's dismal start to the 2024/25 season.",
      "Amorim hasn't really been able to stop the rot. Last season, the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League - their lowest position in club history. They also suffered heartbreak in the Europa League final, losing to Tottenham and missing out on a crucial route back into the Champions League.",

      "After all, he certainly believes he is. \"I truly believe I'm the right guy for this job. I really don't know the biggest challenge [here] - I will find out during the next months,\" he told reporters in November last year.",
      "\"I'm a little bit of a dreamer, and I believe in myself, I also believe in the club. We have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help, but I truly believe in the players also. I know you guys don't believe a lot in these players.",

      "The Portuguese coach was part of a five-man shortlist to take over at the Theatre of Dreams, alongside Southgate, Potter, Thomas Frank and Xavi Hernandez. This was after Ten Hag's position at the club became untenable, with just four wins in 14 games across all competitions in the 2024/25 season.",

While the now-40-year-old's first year in charge was full of ups and downs, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stuck by his manager despite fierce criticism.",

      "\"You know, he’s not a guy who … he’s got to be good on the stage, but we want him to be good on the grass. And part of that is life on the stage, isn’t it?",
      "\"You know, you’re a young guy, you’ve come into the Premier League for the first time in your life, you’ve come in mid-season, it’s not your natural language. You have to give the guy a bit of a break.",
      "\"I mean, give me a hard time, I have no problem with that. But give Ruben a break. I think he’s a good guy; he’s working hard, and I think he’s doing a great job.\"",
      "When asked if he believed Amorim was the right man for the job, Ratcliffe added: \"Yeah, I do, honestly. I really, really like Ruben. He’s a very thoughtful guy. Every time I go to the training ground, I speak to Ruben.",
      "\"I sit down and have a cup of coffee with him and tell him where it’s going wrong, and he tells me to f*** off. I like him.\"",
      "Amorim's attitude seems to have been a strong selling point for Ratcliffe, and it looks like the businessman has been right to stand by the young coach for the time being. Right now, United are sitting pretty in sixth place in the Premier League, recently recording wins over Sunderland, Brighton and reigning champions Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United are sitting level on points with city rivals Manchester City, and are just six points off first-placed Arsenal heading into November. Two tricky away days to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur are coming up next but the feeling around Old Trafford is now one of hope rather than despair for fans.",

      "Paul Scholes has recalled an occasion when Ravel Morrison was on the subs bench for Manchester United's reverses and, despite being told to warm-up, headed down the tunnel and \"f***ed off home\".",
      "Scholes was in the midst of getting coaching experience and was alongside Warren Joyce as he took a set of United players to Altrincham. Morrison was hailed as a generational talent coming through the youth ranks and was tipped for big things.",
      "Despite his obvious quality his attitude was cited as an issue and, clearly disgruntled about being left on the bench for so long, he snubbed a request to get ready to come on and opted to instead leave.",
      "Morrison never made Joyce or Scholes aware so they planned to bring him on, only to find he wasn't there with Scholes admitting he was a tough player to manage and was capable of going AWOL.",
      "He told The Good, The Bad, The Football podcast: \"Remember Ravel Morrison - We we're playing a reverse game when I was doing a bit of coaching under Warren Joyce. We played at Altrincham and Ravel was sub. We'd made all but one sub so we told Ravel to warm-up.",
      "\"At Altrincham the dugouts and where you warm-up is where the tunnel is. So we're looking for him 'Ravel, time to come on'. Not there. He'd gone down the tunnel, got changed and f***ed off home.\" Pressed further on why he chose to leave Scholes suggested that maybe it was because he was the last player to come on. \"Don't know, he was the last sub,\" he said.",
      "\"Warren went mad obviously but Ravel was like he could just disappear. He wouldn't coem in to training for two weeks and you'd go find him playing 5-a-side with his mates. Look he had issues, but what a talent and he's just f***ed off.\"",
      "Morrison would play just three times for United, none of which came in the Premier League, before moving on to West Ham. There he had a brief stint whereby he began to realise his potential, but it was short-lived. He had loan spells at the likes of Birmingham and QPR before his nomadic, globe-trotting career really took off. Now 32, Morrison has played in Sweden, the Netherlands, the USA. Currently he's calling the second tier in Dubai home.",
      "Rio Ferdinand previously claimed: \"Look at Ravel Morrison. This guy was the best young kid that I've ever seen in my life. Better than Joe Cole was when he was a kid. Ravel Morrison, I've never seen a guy look so comfortable on a football pitch, but you can't just have one of them without the other, you've got to have everything.\"",

      "Grimsby boss David Artell believes overcoming Brentford will be a tougher task than their Manchester United giant killing in the Carabao Cup - insisting the Bees' principles are far more deep rooted than at the Red Devils.",
      "The League Two outfit enjoyed one of the greatest nights in their history when they stunned the Premier League giants back in August. They led 2-0 at Blundell Park before being pegged back, but completed the job following a lengthy penalty shootout.",
      "Grimsby remain the lowest ranked side still in the tournament, beating Sheffield Wednesday in the third round, and are now just one game from the quarter-finals. Brentford stand between them and that stage but the west Londoners are fresh off beating Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "Last month they also got the better of Ruben Amorim's side and Artell insists they will pose the toughest test yet. Keith Andrews was hired internally to replace Thomas Frank when he left for Tottenham and the Grimsby boss believes their continued identity makes them a tougher outfit.",
      "He said: “I don’t want loads of letters from Manchester United fans from Kenya or Norway - or Stretford - but I think they’re still in that process of finding their way again.Brentford are fully in, fully understanding. That makes it so much more difficult. I think everyone agrees that Man United are still - maybe not in transition per se - but finding their way under a new manager that needs to be given time.",
      "“I think you can see the fruits of the green shoots of progress from their side, but Brentford are not that team. Brentford are a well-established team. They’ve appointed from within to continue the work that the previous manager [Thomas Frank] did, and I think everyone would suggest that Keith Andrews is doing a brilliant job and he’s taking them on.",
      "“You don’t beat West Ham so comprehensively, you don’t beat the reigning [Premier League] champions [Liverpool] if you haven’t got those principles of play already ingrained. Whether it’s set pieces, whether it’s transitions, whether it’s in possession, whether they come and get you out of possession, all that is already really well implemented into the squad. I’m not sure that was the case with Man United.”",
      "Grimsby have outlined their plan to go after Brentford with their head coach maintaining they will not sit in hoping to force the lottery of penalties. \"We’re not playing for penalties. We didn’t do that against United. We went and got them and they didn’t expect it,\" he said.",
      "Andrews has hinted at changes to the Brentford team as the games come thick and fast but wouldn't be taking the fourth tier outfit likely as he claimed they are \"very respectful around them and the qualities they have\".",
      "Grimsby sit sixth in League Two but have lost three of their last four in all competitions having been beaten by Crewe at the weekend.",

      "Manchester United could turn their attention to Nottingham Forest ace Elliot Anderson as they look to add a central midfielder to their squad - but the England star could cost as much as £120million.",
      "The Red Devils were keen on adding more quality in the middle of the park back in the summer but ultimately ran out of cash, putting it on the back burner. Carlos Baleba emerged as a target following his stellar efforts with Brighton.",
      "A move was always deemed unrealistic and the player remained at the Amex, but United have a number of midfielders they are tracking with Anderson among them. Newcastle are also keen on the midfielder, who came through their academy before he was sold for PSR reasons.",
      "Anderson has since thrived at the City Ground, becoming one of their top performers. He was part of the triumphant England U21 side at the summer's Euros and has been named in several senior squads with World Cup involvement on the horizon.",
      "Sky in Germany report that Anderson has no release clause, putting Forest in a strong negotiating position. They want somewhere between £100m-£120m if they are to sell their midfielder. That would be a club-record fee for either United or Newcastle.",
      "Anderson only cost Forest £35m but at 22 has his prime years ahead of him. He would also help fill the homegrown quota, making him a more attractive proposition. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has confessed that his exit still irks him and he'd welcome him back with open arms.",
      "The midfielder's value could further skyrocket if he excels at the World Cup across North America next summer. Ruben Amorim is currently playing with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his preferred midfield duo, but pundits believe both players have flaws in that position.",
      "Fernandes is having to play in a deeper role, limiting how much influence he can have in the final third. Casemiro is now into his 30s and, despite some impressive weeks, critics have claimed he lacks the stamina to get round the pitch effectively.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is a clear admirer of Anderson having given him England opportunities and recently lauded the qualities possessed by the Forest ace.",
      "“He’s just a very, very good football player,\" he said. \"He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he’s very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe showed he can swallow his pride when admitting there were \"errors\" made at Manchester United regarding the handling of Erik ten Hag's dismissal. Tuesday marks the first anniversary of Ten Hag being sacked at Old Trafford, not long before Ruben Amorim took over as his successor.",
      "United co-owner Ratcliffe fired Ten Hag in October 2024, just a few months after the Dutchman was handed a new deal. The Red Devils rewarded their former chief after he surprised Manchester City to lift the FA Cup, believing that the victory would signal the start of a revival.",
      "It wasn't to be, however, and Ten Hag was shown the door with United sitting 14th in the Premier League at the time. And it wasn't long after that Dan Ashworth was also relieved of his duties as sporting director only a few months into the role.",
      "There's no telling where United might be had they decided to cut ties with Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 rather than grant him a stay of execution. However, Ratcliffe has already conceded it was a mistake in his judgment to grant a reprieve.",
      "\"Those decisions [delaying Ten Hag's dismissal and hiring Ashworth] were errors,\" he said in March 2025. \"There were some mitigating circumstances, but they were errors. I accept that and apologise.",
      "\"It wasn’t just the FA Cup final. The fans were of the view that we’d like to stick with him. With Erik, there was an emotional response. We get criticised for being unemotional and there was a bit of emotion with that.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik, the management team hadn’t been in place more than five minutes. It became clearer three months later. We corrected it and are in a different place today.\"",
      "That's even more true today after United entered unfamiliar territory having climbed to sixth in the table. The Red Devils beat Brighton 4-2 on Saturday to celebrate three straight league wins for the first time under the incumbent chief.",
      "United have also now won four home games in a row since losing to Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season. That's seen the club restore some of its former lustre after looking so vulnerable at Old Trafford for stretches of last term and beyond.",
      "Amorim's side sit level on points with bitter rivals City and are just two points below Bournemouth in second. And after so many questions of faith in Amorim's project, there appear to be signs of their investment paying off.",
      "The Portuguese tactician has had to endure a torrent of scrutiny over whether he too was the right man for the job. And although a long road filled with many more potholes lies ahead, there is renewed trust he and United have the means to weather the journey.",
      "Ten Hag, meanwhile, returned to coaching this past summer but was swiftly sacked once more at Bayer Leverkusen. His loss is proving to be not only Amorim's gain, but the change in leadership also vindicates Ratcliffe and his team - for now.",

      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

      "The arrival of Hojlund saw United commit to paying as much as £72m, but with his loan move to Napoli including an obligation to buy at the end of the season for £38m next summer, the £34m loss is far smaller than it could have been.",
      "Jadon Sancho has avoided the wrath of United fans lately, purely down to the fact he has spent so much time away from the club looking to restart his career. His career is still in freefall and there's every possibility he will be allowed to leave for free next summer. £72.9m signing, £72.9m loss. Even Antony and Hojlund weren't that bad.",
      "It seems absolutely unthinkable that a club could spend £72.9m on a player and not choose to trigger a 12-month extension in his contract, thus allowing them the opportunity to try and sell him next summer - the fee would be minimal but it would be better than nothing.",
      "Yet that's the position United in themselves in with Sancho. What chance have they got of offloading a player who Chelsea paid £5m not to sign in the summer and who already looks to be causing problems at Aston Villa after he snubbed Unai Emery's handshake on the touchline on Sunday.",
      "It must be added that United have received some handsome loan fees from Dortmund and Chelsea, meaning their loss on the player won't be as bad as it could have been. But the fact both sides opted against signing him permanently having initially been so keen to take him on a temporary deal says a lot in itself.",
      "Sancho might turn it around at Villa and secure himself a permanent both to Villa Park or elsewhere, but it's difficult to see that happening.",
      "The January transfer window will mark the two-year anniversary of Sancho's loan move to Dortmund, in which time his only United appearance came in the glorified pre-season friendly that is the Community Shield. Two years on and United still don't want him yet still can't sell him.",
      "The argument for letting a £72.9m signing stroll out of the exit door for free is starting to look a compelling one.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "The January transfer window is fast approaching but for Manchester United, they are riding the crest of a wave after claiming their third win in a row after beating Brighton 4-2 over the weekend.",
      "United were red hot against the Seagulls at Old Trafford and raced into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo. Brighton provided a late scare with two goals before Mbeumo made sure of the three straight wins.",
      "While the immediate focus is on United's recent upturn in form and next Saturday's trip to Nottingham Forest, transfer talk is still bubbling in the air with the January transfer window approaching.",
      "Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo is enjoying a breakout season as he establishes himself as the Cherries' main man. The forward's exploits have been instrumental in a brilliant start for Andoni Iraola's side.",
      "Elliot Anderson is another being closely monitored with Newcastle United also interested in bringing their former midfielder back to his boyhood club. It would likely cost any team three times the £35million paid by Nottingham Forest to sign him in 2026.",
      "Marcus Rashford has also remained in the headlines after another strong outing for Barcelona with a permanent exit from Old Trafford next summer seeming likely.",
      "While Harry Maguire's training absence was a blow, Mason Mount has fully overcome the minor issue that made him a doubt for the win over Brighton.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls.",
      "The midfielder took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "Marcus Rashford spoke on a number of topics before the El Clasico clash between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The England international assisted Fermin Lopez in his side's 2-1 defeat.",
      "That is now 10 goal contributions for the season with Rashford certainly enjoying life at the Catalan giants. It is perhaps no surprise he is doing so well having made it clear during an interview with ESPN that a fresh challenge may have been needed",
      "It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.",
      "While several Premier League clubs are preparing for Carabao Cup action, Ruben Amorim will have plenty of days on the training ground ahead of Manchester United's next clash against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby Town in the second round came as a major blow but it may have actually been a blessing in disguise for United as they have less games when it comes to mounting a top-four charge.",
      "Victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have built confidence with fixtures against Forest and Tottenham their only two matches prior to the November international break.",
      "Forest have also been eliminated from the Carabao Cup however, with Sean Dyche having 24 hours less prep than Amorim after his side played on Sunday.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in Manchester United's latest training session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",
      "Maguire scored the winner in his side's historic triumph over Liverpool earlier this month.",
      "Odsonne Edouard has made his feelings clear on Manchester United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy with a brutal verdict when discussing their time together at Leicester City.",
      "The 27-year-old joined the Foxes on loan from Crystal Palace, but only played a total of 142 minutes. None of those arrived under Van Nistelrooy with Edouard - now at Lens in France - making his feelings clear on the Dutchman.",
      "He told L’Equipe: “Being a great striker doesn’t necessarily mean being a great coach. At the beginning, I played a little [under Steve Cooper], then things didn’t work out with Van Nistelrooy.",
      "“I didn’t get along well with Van Nistelrooy. I found myself blocked for seven months without playing.”",
      "Manchester United have won their last three games in the Premier League, triumphing over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Veteran midfielder Casemiro has played a key role in all of those wins but Ruben Amorim may soon have to handle a match without him.",
      "Having received three yellow cards this season, he is just two cautions away from having to serve a one-match ban. Patrick Dorgu is also in the same position after his booking off the bench this past weekend.",
      "In order to avoid being suspended, both players will have to try and get past United's 19th game of the season without picking up two yellows.",
      "Manchester United are one of three teams being linked to RB Salzburg winger Kerim Alajbegovic.",
      "He joined Salzburg for just over £1million after coming through the Bayer Leverkusen academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford has revealed the true feelings of several Manchester United players towards former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The Norwegian was in charge of United for three years with performances arguably as consistent as any head coach had managed since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "During his tenure, United finished in the top four twice and also reached the Europa League final but did suffer defeat in that showpiece clash to Villareal. A 4-1 defeat to Watford just a few months later was his final game in charge with United having had five big names take the helm since his exit.",
      "Since being given an opportunity in the senior team by Louis van Gaal, he has played under eight different managers and his recent comments suggest that his best memories came with Solskjaer in charge.",
      "“Ole is a fantastic person,\" he admitted to TV2. \"I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him.”",
      "“We played good football under Ole. It was a very successful period for me personally. He is a fantastic person, and I don’t have a bad word to say about him.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand believes Danny Welbeck could still do a job for Manchester United.",
      "The striker was on target for Brighton as he helped spark the fightback but it came to no avail as they lost 4-2.",
      "But given the struggles at Old Trafford, Ferdinand has described the business to let Welbeck go as a 'balls up'.",
      "'It was a balls up that they actually let him leave the club,\" he said.",
      "'If you're talking form, and if the squad was picked right tomorrow, Danny Welbeck has to go, no?",
      "\"Experience, can do different things on the pitch for you, Manchester boy, loves the club, a great kid, never a day's trouble at the football club, got a nice way about him, great family.",
      "\"What are you selling him for?\"",
      "Some more from Florian Plettenberg this morning, United are in concrete talks with Swedish side AIK over 16-year-old striker Kevin Filling.",
      "It has been said that the striker could leave as early as January, with his price around €3million.",
      "Bundesliga clubs are claimed to be considering him.",
      "He has two goals in seven appearances this season and only made his debut four months ago.",
      "However, he adds that Newcastle United are also into the hunt with both clubs registering interest.",
      "But in his report, it's suggested a move in January is unlikely with the summer more likely, where he is likely to be priced around £100m to £120m.",
      "Wayne Rooney has lavished praise of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Manchester United hero has lauded the summer signing after he continued his run of form against Brighton on Saturday.",
      "Rooney said: \"Mbeumo has been consistent with his performances, I think that's the main thing.",
      "\"If you're consistently getting in the right positions, getting chances, you will score. When you're a forward and you score goals, you enjoy scoring goals and that feeling keeps going.",
      "\"His confidence is very high at the minute. Hopefully that continues because he's certainly been the best signing for United this season.\"",
      "West Ham United have been credited with interest in Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "According to David Ornstein, the Hammers are in a rush to sign reinforcements to aid their bid for survival.",
      "They sit second from bottom in the Premier League and the forthcoming window poses as a crucial opportunity to add quality to help them avoid the drop.",
      "Ornstein told NBC: \"I am told by sources at the club that they (West Ham) are looking to bring in a few new players.",
      "\"A forward would surely be on the agenda, but not Ivan Toney. Other players are linked with them: Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee at Manchester United.",
      "\"But I think it’s a pretty remote chance [that the Hammers get either of them]. We don’t even know if they will be leaving Old Trafford.\"",
      "According to The Telegraph, Man United were among the clubs interested in Antoine Semenyo in the summer.",
      "It has been reported that a £50million bid was rejected for the forward.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are also said to be interested in his services.",
      "Instead, the 25-year-old signed a bumper new five-year deal at the Vitality Stadium.",
      "But in doing so, a release clause was included.",
      "It was an indifferent weekend for Jadon Sancho.",
      "He was introduced as a first-half substitute during Sunday's 1-0 win over Manchester City. However, he was brought off late on.",
      "What does the future hold?",
      "Well, Steven Railston has reported that Manchester United will decide on his future before the end of the season.",
      "Sancho is contracted at Old Trafford until June, but there is the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "United chiefs will decide whether to allow Sancho to leave when his deal expires. There is also the option of triggering the one-year extension with a view to obtaining a transfer fee for the winger.",
      "Hello and welcome to our dedicated Man United news and transfer blog.",
      "What a time to be a United fan, Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best period as manager and the club look to have established themselves as early Champions League contenders.",
      "All the build-up and focus on the training pitch is for Nottingham Forest as United face a battle against Sean Dyche's side.",
      "Let's get this show on the road."

      "After Manchester United's defeat to Grimsby Town in August it was clear Andre Onana needed to be moved on.",
      "Onana was given the benefit of the doubt under Erik ten Hag after a rocky start to his United career. The Cameroonian was brought in to play out from the back, and the manager who spent £47.2million to sign him was always likely to afford him time to adapt, but it soon became clear his shot-stopping wasn't at the level required and the ball-playing ability he was meant to bring also deserted him.",
      "An injury picked up during pre-season allowed Altay Bayindir the chance to stake his claim for a place in the side. The Turkey international looked even less reliable than Onana, yet Amorim persisted with Bayindir, meaning it was obvious he didn't see a future for him at Old Trafford.",
      "When Onana got his chance to prove he could return to his best he blew it. His first half display at Blundell Park was a nightmare and Senne Lammens' arrival on deadline day meant Onana was destined for the exit door.",
      "His move to Trabzonspor was the right outcome for all parties. Since Onana joined the Turkish club, Lammens has shown himself to be up to the task of being No.1 at Old Trafford. While Onana is unlikely to play for United again, he is doing exactly what is needed of him over in Turkey.",
      "Onana has been an ever-present in the Trabzonspor team since his move, and has only suffered defeat once - on his debut against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor have won their last four matches in the Super Lig and United's loanee has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances.",
      "Only three teams have a better defensive record in the Super Lig than Trabzonspor this season, with Onana's side currently second in the table behind leaders Galatasaray.",
      "United will likely look to cash in on Onana this summer and so it's within their best interests for Onana to showcase his ability while out on loan. United's overhaul under Ruben Amorim is ongoing and they need to make as much money as possible from sales to accelerate the rebuild.",
      "There is still a long way to go this season but if Onana can continue to impress over in Turkey then it can only be good news for United.",

      "Ruben Amorim applauded Manchester United fans as he hurried down the touchline after the win against Brighton. Amorim prefers to make a hasty exit after wins to allow his players to soak up the applause.",
      "Amorim couldn't resist passionately shouting \"come on!\" at the Stretford End before he disappeared down the tunnel on Saturday.",
      "The moment was captured on video by a supporter and has amassed nearly 1million views on X. United fans have been lapping up Amorim content after what has been a potentially tenure-defining six days.",
      "Amorim spent around 30 minutes posing for photos and signing autographs for fans after the Brighton victory. He has done that after every Old Trafford game during his tenure.",
      "It's an admirable trait. Amorim has made time to engage with supporters even after shocking results and did not ignore young fans who requested a photo after the Grimsby Town defeat in August.",
      "Amorim was seething about the result and would have been forgiven for ignoring the supporters. Most managers wouldn't have acknowledged the request, but he took five seconds to take a photograph.",
      "It felt like Amorim had a mountain to climb after the Grimsby and Manchester City defeats, but United have won three league games on the bounce and are officially an in-form team.",
      "Amorim's passionate \"come on!\" shouted into the Stretford End was a release of 12 weeks of huge pressure. He needed to oversee an unlikely turnaround to save his job and seems to have done so.",
      "Amorim was asked how important the victory was and said: \"It was really important, also the performance, we had to play different games in different moments of the game.",
      "\"And I think the players understood really well what to do in every moment. We had to suffer a bit at the end, it wouldn’t be Manchester United without a bit of suffering, but we deserved the win against a very good team, a team that is hard to press against high, but we did really well.",
      "\"I think they [the players] are more confident, the best game we did this season was against Arsenal. But then when you are confident, you have a different spirit, that helps you to win games. That's what I'm feeling now. We're a little bit more free. Last week we are a bit more luck because of that.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I have that feeling [that Brighton is a bigger win than Liverpool], I think it was a more complete performance. You can say whatever you want to say against Liverpool, but Liverpool did not deserve to win that game. Today we did everything. We had the ball and created chances.",
      "\"We defend high, we defend low and when it's more complete, it's not a statement, but I feel more complete as a manager. So today, I liked it more today than the last weekend.\"",
      "Amorim has always been good value during press conferences and possesses no shortage of personality, so it's fitting that two big characters have transformed the team's attack.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were the standout performers against Brighton. Cunha is hugely popular in the dressing room, he's extroverted and has the character to demand the ball during games.",
      "Mbeumo is slightly different and gradually comes out of his shell with new acquaintances, according to the man himself, but he never shies away from the ball and can always make something happen.",
      "Amorim wanted to sign personalities in the summer transfer window, while Bruno Fernandes advised decision-makers that signing players with the right character should be the priority.",
      "There will be more first pumps from Amorim if United continue to win games. They suddenly look like a confident team with a solid defensive foundation, which bodes well ahead of the winter schedule.",

The 49-year-old took charge of the Foxes in November 2024 with relegation from the Premier League a few months later sealing his fate.",
      "United arguably played a role in his appointment at the King Power Stadium as he enjoyed a very fruitful four-week stint as interim boss at Old Trafford following the dismissal of Erik ten Hag.",
      "Leicester were beaten twice by United in that period with it clear the club's hierarchy got a good look at Van Nistelrooy. However, when managing Leicester, he oversaw just four league wins from a possible 25 with Leicester ending the campaign 13 points from safety with his exit confirmed soon after that.",
      "A public falling out with Harry Winks certainly did not help matters and it seems as though he and Edouard also did not have the best relationship.",

      "It was one in and one out for Manchester United's striker department this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival meant it was inevitable Rasmus Hojlund would be on his way out of the club, and so it proved as the Dane signed for Napoli on loan. Hojlund's switch to Naples included an obligation to buy, meaning we won't be seeing him back at Old Trafford in the red of United.",
      "The signing of Sesko and the departure of Hojlund meant is was very much as you were for United's only other senior striker, Joshua Zirkzee. And yet he's still dropped a place in the pecking order.",
      "Despite not being a conventional centre forward, Zirkzee was expected to provide competition and support for Sesko, as he had done the previous season with Hojlund.",
      "At this stage of last season, Zirkzee had made 13 appearances in all competitions, playing a total of 592 minutes. A year on and he has made just five appearances, with his outings amounting to a combined total of just 90 minutes worth of football. Granted last season there were a few more games due to United's Europa League involvement and them spending longer in the Carabao Cup, but clearly the Dutchman isn't being given the chances he was last season.",
      "And it's not because Sesko is flying. The Slovenia international has started to find his feet of late but he still has just two goals in ten games. The reason for the dramatic reduction in Zirkzee's playing time is Ruben Amorim's use of a striker-less formation.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount led the line for United in their opening three league games of the season, with Amorim moving back to the same three-pronged attack against Liverpool.",
      "The Anfield outing was comfortably United's finest performance of the season and proved to Amorim that the striker-less formation can be a genuine option moving forward.",
      "Amorim either doesn't play with a striker or he goes with Sesko. So where does that leave Zirkzee? Surplus to requirements is the answer.",
      "The Netherlands international is understood to be attracting interest from a number of clubs, with West Ham and Sevilla both monitoring his situation.",
      "Valued at £24million by Transfermarkt, there's every chance United could look to cash in on Zirkzee in January as they look to address their problems in midfield, whether that be in the mid-season window or in the summer.",
      "If it hadn't been for the striker-less formation proving its worth, there's every chance United would have decided Zirkzee had to stay.",
      "As it is, he's clearly not going to get the game time he needs ahead of next summer's World Cup. It's within the best interests of all involved for a buyer to be sought.",

      "Marcus Rashford claims to have shared the true feelings of several Manchester United players towards former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The Norwegian was in charge of United for three years with performances arguably as consistent as any head coach had managed since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "During his tenure, United finished in the top four twice and also reached the Europa League final, but did suffer defeat in that showpiece clash to Villarreal. A 4-1 defeat to Watford just a few months later was his final game in charge with United having had five big names take the helm since his exit.",
      "Since being given an opportunity in the senior team by Louis van Gaal, Rashford has played under eight different managers and his recent comments suggest that his best moments came with Solskjaer in charge.",
      "“Ole is a fantastic person,\" he admitted to TV2. \"I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him.",
      "“We played good football under Ole. It was a very successful period for me personally. He is a fantastic person, and I don’t have a bad word to say about him.”",
      "Asked if he keeps in contact with the former Besiktas and Molde boss, he replied: “Yes, from time to time, but it’s been a while now.”",
      "Erik ten Hag and current boss Ruben Amorim have been the only two permanent hires since then with Rashford enjoying very different relationships under both. The 27-year-old was unplayable at times under Ten Hag and he played a key role in United winning both domestic cup competitions.",
      "Rashford scored three goals in as many appearances following the arrival of Amorim, but he was later ostracized from the first-team squad after a falling out with United's new manager.",
      "A successful loan move to Aston Villa arrived that January all while United endured the worst season in their history.",
      "Having not been reintegrated back into the squad, Rashford looked destined to depart permanently this past summer, but instead sealed a dream move - if only on a temporary basis - to Barcelona. The transfer does include a £30million buy-option.",
      "While a decision is unlikely to be made until next year at the earliest, it is looking very likely he will be a permanent signing.",
      "That is because he has managed 10 goal contributions from as many games so far this season with the latest of those an assist in the El Classico defeat to Real Madrid this past weekend.",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has shared an update on his recovery from injury after a heartbreaking Manchester United setback earlier this year.",
      "The eldest son of the United legend hopes to emulate his father's incredible career, but he suffered an injury setback, stating: 'Life couldn't get any worse.'",
      "The youngster clearly has his father's passion for the game and has impressed for United's youth sides this season. He caughgt the eye during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament in which his father also shone as a youngster at Everton.",
      "Kai was in the midst of a meteoric rise, having been called up to United's Under-19s side, where he competed against professionals four-years older than him.",
      "Prior to that call-up, he'd scored an incredible goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that nestled in the top corner, reminiscent of some of his father's brilliant strikes.",
      "Earlier this year, Kai shared an image on social media of his right foot in a boot, but has now updated fans on his recovery.",
      "Taking to Instagram, he shared two photos enjoying some down time in Dubai, with his foot no longer in a protective boot. The youngster captioned the pictures: \"Recovering\" followed by an emjoi shrowded in smoke.",
      "It's still unclear the exact nature of his injury, though the images suggest a return to action may not be too far away.",
      "The youngster tends to operate in a central attacking role, like his father Wayne, but can also play on either side of the attack.",
      "When asked about his son's football, in an interview with BBC Sport, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Rooney's eldest son has been a part of the United academy since he was 11-years-old after joining the youth set up in 2020.",

      "Mbeumo is expected to be named in the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, which will take place across December and January. If selected, the 26-year-old will not be available for United during Cameroon's involvement in the tournament and could miss several club fixtures.",
      "Because of this, The Sun is reporting that United have decided against letting some players leave the club in January. Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo are two players who have been linked with moves away from United during the winter window.",
      "As reported over the weekend, Zirkzee is set to request a transfer away from United in the upcoming window, with West Ham United leading the race to provide the Dutch international an exit route from his Old Trafford woes. The 24-year-old managed to net just seven goals in 49 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "This season, he has featured only four times, with his most recent league goal for United dating back to December, 10 months ago. While Mainoo has also been linked with a midseason move away from the Reds.",
      "But the report The Sun claims that in the event that either player does express a desire to leave Old Trafford, United will not allow them to leave the club in the New Year.",
      "Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui could also link up with their countries to compete at the Africa Cup of Nations, meaning they would also be unavailable for United for several weeks.",

      "The relief around Old Trafford was obvious when Matheus Cunha opened the scoring for Manchester United against Brighton.",
      "Not only had the Reds made their dominance count but Cunha had broken his duck. The Brazilian did well to open his body up and slot the ball out of the reach of Bart Verbruggen.",
      "Cunha continued to play an important role for United in the victory and deservedly mopped up the plaudits, even if his teammate Bryan Mbeumo stole the back pages. It was only after the match though that Cunha proved why he was the perfect signing for United.",
      "\"It is hard to say something now,\" a smiling Cunha admitted. \"I have worked so hard for this.",
      "\"This is the club and this performance needs to be common and normal. I feel so good to be part of this.",
      "\"My first goal here at Old Trafford, I dreamed a lot of this but of course the win is much more important. I joked with Bryan [Mbeumo] and [Benjamin] Sesko, I told them I need to have this feeling [scoring], I felt so anxious to be a part of this and when I scored they said 'look, you can enjoy it now'.",
      "\"All the day the support for my teammates, I feel so good to be part of this.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim needs players with character, and in Cunha he certainly has that. Every player who pulls on a United shirt should recognise just how privileged they are to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, and it's clearly not something Cunha takes for granted.",
      "Let's not forget, Cunha could have moved elsewhere. Plenty of big clubs wanted him, but for him, it was always United.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho showed his true colours after being substituted during Chelsea's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The former Manchester United winger was visibly frustrated when Enzo Maresca replaced him with Estevao in the 58th minute. After scoring the opening goal inside four minutes, Garnacho believed he had more to offer before Chelsea went on to lose 2-1.",
      "Maresca's decision sparked backlash from Chelsea fans on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).",
      "One said: \"Garnacho was probably the only attacker having a decent game … so of course he’s the first one Maresca subs off. No wonder he was shaking his head,\" while another posted: \"Maresca taking out the attacker who was most likely to score today in Garnacho was not the move.\"",
      "A third continued: \"Maresca makes terrible substitutions. Why take off Garnacho so early?\"",
      "Garnacho celebrated his goal by sitting on the advertising hoarding, joined by team-mate Pedro Neto. The moment served as a reminder for United fans - a similar celebration took place during their win over West Ham in February 2024 when Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund struck the same pose.",
      "At the time, the trio were seen as the future of United. But Garnacho later completed the £40million move to Stamford Bridge while Hojlund is also expected to leave Old Trafford, having shown positive signs following a loan move to Napoli.",
      "Before his switch to west London, Garnacho found himself in United's so-called 'bomb squad' - sidelined during pre-season as Ruben Amorim eyed an overhaul that included moving him on alongside several teammates.",
      "As for Chelsea, their run of four straight wins in all competitions came to a dramatic halt as Sunderland's Chemsdine Talbi struck a stoppage-time winner at Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I think in general we were not good enough,\" said Maresca afterwards. \"When you are not good enough in the Premier League we know that the consequences can be bad.",

However, a nervy finish was in store after Danny Welbeck's free kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header in added time.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up to seal the victory late in the game, meaning he now has five goals since his move to United. Cunha's strike was just his first for the club and Mbeumo admitted it was a relief for the Brazilian to get off the mark. \"Yeah, of course the pressure is off his shoulders today with the goal, he was waiting for it and we were waiting for it as well,\" he explained.",
      "\"We are very happy for him. We are growing the link-ups between each other [himself, Sesko and Cunha].",

It hasn’t been easy coming into this environment, a big club, the expectations are not easy to handle but with the teammates, everyone is helping me, helping the team, helping the new players and I think that was very important.\"",
      "When asked whether he could match the 20 goals he scored in the last campaign, Mbeumo said: \"I always try to aim big in everything that I do. I try not to set limits on myself and on what I can reach. I am just going to work on that as much as possible.",
      "United's win moved them up to fourth and Mbeumo is optimistic for the future. \"Everyone wants to fight for as high as possible,\" he said.",

      "While the post was deleted, the impact of it perhaps lingered as the Cameroonian's hour at Old Trafford played out. At 21, there is plenty of room for improvement but that possible United transfer will need to be put on hold for now.",
      "Baleba was the player United fans had their eye on in the opposition ranks but he struggled. Bryan Mbeumo gave him a torrid time and when the midfielder unleashed a wayward shot in the second half, Fabian Hurzeler knew it was time to make a change.",
      "With Baleba not being the £100m man that Brighton hoped he would be at Old Trafford, his exit allowed another player to catch the eye in the form of Yankuba Minteh. When the 21-year-old left Newcastle in 2024, eyebrows were raised considering he had only been at St James' Park for a year.",
      "During that 12 months he was loaned to Feyenoord so Newcastle supporters did not get to see his potential. Eddie Howe may have been kicking himself had he watched Minteh's display at Old Trafford.",
      "He showed what he could do early in the first half as he turned the normally unflappable Leny Yoro inside out, before just running out of room. However, he continued to be positive and direct, proving to be the main source of all that was good about Brighton's play.",
      "In the second half, he switched to the right-hand side but was no less effective, providing a stern test for Ayden Heaven. When he broke down the middle, Patrick Dorgu was in trouble and was very fortunate to see the winger take a slightly heavy touch.",
      "Minteh and Danny Welbeck were arguably the two Brighton players who did not deserve to be on the losing side at Old Trafford.",
      "Would Minteh fit into the United system? Potentially. He is young and you could see him playing a similar role to Amad or Mbeumo.",
      "Should United pay £100m for him? Almost certainly not, especially as that position is well stocked at present and it may not take that much to sign Minteh anyway. But the winger showed Baleba the level you need to be at to earn that United move.",
      "Yes, one is a forward and the other a defensive midfielder, but Minteh played with the freedom that his teammate did not.",
      "Instead of being overawed by the occasion, Minteh relished it, and United would not go wrong looking at him in the future.",

      "The wing-back seemed to be clipped by Maxim De Cuyper, but referee Anthony Taylor was quick to wave away any claims for a spot-kick. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre account on X read: \"The referee’s call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "In the aftermath of the game, both Gallagher and Bothroyd debated a host of controversial refereeing decisions, including Amad's incident. However, they were unable to reach an agreement.",
      "Bothroyd said: “This is a definite penalty for me. Amad Diallo is running into the box. There is the slightest touch.",
      "“The defender, he puts his leg out, so obviously he has made contact. He touched the ball slightly, but that contact, has stopped Amad getting to the ball.",
      "“So whether he has touched the ball or not, and it’s a miniscule that he has touched that, because the ball is basically travelling in the same direction, he has stopped Amad getting to that. That’s why I would say that is a penalty.",
      "“It’s the same as [Viktor] Gyokeres, again the smallest touch. These touches are not enough to say, ‘Oh he has touched the ball. It can’t be a penalty,’ because players can still get back to the ball. That’s why I would say the Amad one is a penalty.”",
      "Gallagher, who spent over 15 years refereeing at the top level, disagreed with Bothroyd and pointed to previous incidents as to why the decision was made.",
      "He said: “It’s interesting we have seen Gyokeres with Pope, we saw Saka with Kevin and we’ve seen this one, they’ve been consistent - if they get a touch on the ball, they are not going to give a penalty, they’ve done it for week six, week eight and week nine.\"",
      "Bothroyd then replied: “But they did not do it for week five when Sanchez touched the ball and Mbeumo goes through. So they’ve changed the rule after week five is basically what you are saying.",
      "Gallagher then said: “I didn’t say that at all. I said since the Gyokeres one where they came out and said, ‘He’s got a touch on the ball.’ In this situation, they have been consistent, as you’ve asked for, and they haven’t given any of them.”",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "A pundit has explained why Manchester United should avoid signing Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, with it argued that the Red Devils “don’t need” him.",
      "Wharton has emerged as one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League and it’s been suggested that he is a possible signing for Man Utd next year.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils were focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd’s next transfer priority will be to sign a new centre-midfielder as they require an upgrade on Casemiro and it’s been suggested that Wharton could cost as little as £60m next year, though Palace will likely demand nearer to £100m.",
      "Wharton has immense natural ability and could play for any team in the world, though ex-Man Utd player Paul Parker reckons his former club “doesn’t need” him because he’s injury-prone.",
      "“Adam Wharton looks good. Everything he does, I like him,” Parker told MyBettingSites.",
      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "“Playing for a progressive side at the moment. A lot of injuries. Always has something, but it doesn’t seem to bother a lot of clubs who keep on paying money.",
      "“At the moment, United don’t need a player like him who cannot play two-three games without picking up a knock.",
      "“Adam Wharton has done great. Came from Blackburn, hit the ground running. Why didn’t anyone else get him? You’ve got to pat Crystal Palace on the back for that, for the money they spent and how he’s performed.",
      "“Big clubs would rather spend even more money on players whose shirts they can sell. I’m sure Adam Wharton would have loved to come to Man Utd.”",
      "Parker has also explained why he thinks Crystal Palace will refuse to sell Wharton in January.",
      "“But if you’re Crystal Palace, you don’t sell,” Parker added.",
      "“Unless it’s really, really stupid money and the fans can relate to it. They’ll look at the profit margin and go wow.",
      "“The way they are, Crystal Palace, at the moment, they could fill that berth and no one would notice because no one has noticed that they’ve lost two of their best players in the last three seasons, in Eze and Olise.”",
      "England international Elliot Anderson has been mentioned as an alternative, with Parker arguing that Man Utd have a greater chance of signing him than Wharton in January.",
      "“Eliott Anderson has done well at Nottingham and he’s now being pushed as a starter for England but that’s because you don’t have Jude Bellingham to talk about,” Parker claimed.",
      "“So everyone would talk about Anderson because now he’s an England international and his name is popping up. Man Utd need a player with discipline and good legs in that midfield.",
      "“Nottingham Forest are in that position now. With Nuno gone and how things have changed, anything can happen in January.”",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",
      "Man United with Casemiro on the pitch: 3 goals conceded",
      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces.",

      "It has been a pretty great couple of weeks for Man Utd, with the first back-to-back Premier League wins under Ruben Amorim becoming three straight victories over the weekend.",
      "Credit should go to Amorim as he has made slight tweaks to his approach to make his system more effective and this has borne fruit against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Amorim is far from out of the woods, but for the first time in his tenure, it feels like the Red Devils are on an upward curve and can mount a sustained push for Champions League qualification this term.",

      "Summer signings Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have forced a U-turn on the transfer debate as winners Man Utd actually had a better window than losers Liverpool.",
      "All four players have settled nicely in recent weeks and have made a great impact on their winning run, while Man Utd also did a good job at offloading unwanted talents on their terms.",
      "Still, Man Utd’s summer transfer window was not perfect as they failed to sign a quality No.6.",
      "The Red Devils did try to sign one as they pursued an audacious deal for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, though they opted against signing an alternative after being priced out of a £100m-plus transfer.",
      "Without Baleba or another No.6, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have started together in most of Man Utd’s games and although the Brazilian’s revival has been outstanding, Amorim’s side remain far too easy to play through even in the games they have won.",
      "So if Man Utd are to truly be back under Amorim, an upgrade on Casemiro needs to be their next marquee signing, and this looks increasingly likely to be the case.",
      "But this does not mean necessarily mean Baleba.",
      "A report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd have ‘serious doubts’ about a ‘record’ deal for Baleba as he is ‘not yet worth breaking the bank for’.",
      "And these concerns are justified as Baleba is far from the final product and there are issues surrounding his mentality; his performances have clearly been impacted by transfer speculation this season.",
      "The report claims Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ’emerging as names of interest’ and these two would be cheaper than Baleba, while also potentially being better fits for the No.6 role at Old Trafford.",
      "And a contract ‘decision’ is another positive sign for Man Utd, with Football Insider claiming they ‘are not planning to trigger the extension option’ in Casemiro’s deal to extend his deal to 2027 on the same terms.",
      "Although Casemiro’s performances this season have been stronger than in 2024/25, he remains a weak link in Man Utd’s side and his reported £375,000-a-week contract cannot be justified at this stage of his career.",
      "Casemiro could stay at Man Utd by accepting a sizable pay cut, but this feels pretty unlikely with Saudi Pro League sides ‘tracking’ the veteran midfielder. Signing Wharton or Anderson to replace him will be a necessary upgrade in a key department to take the club to the next level under Amorim.",

      "“Casemiro’s game is not about chasing high up the pitch constantly,” the former United defender said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“He built a stellar career on the back of being the glue, the person that knitted the back line and the midfield together and just plug the gaps. He wasn’t asked to run all over the place or be a creator. He was asked to get it and give it to the people that can create.",
      "“He might have scored the odd goal here and there when he went a bit loose, but he was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and being able to stay in an area and marshal that area.",
      "“Recently, this is what we’ve seen. He’s looked something like the old Casemiro.”",

      "Vinicius Junior muttered “I’m leaving the team” having failed to hide his frustration at being substituted in El Clasico and reports on Monday suggest he is ‘seriously considering’ an exit owing the lack of ‘respect’ afforded to him by manager Xabi Alonso. But where could he go? There’s just one option.",
      "Vinicius has helped Madrid win 14 trophies since his arrival in 2018, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, playing a starring role in many of those triumphs. But the 2024 Ballon d’Or runner-up’s frustrations – which have been bubbling under the surface for weeks at the Bernabeu – came to the surface as he stormed off the pitch on Sunday.",
      "After starting on the bench for Madrid’s previous league clash with Getafe, Vinicius was recalled to Alonso’s XI as goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham sealed Madrid a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, but was withdrawn in the 72nd minute by Alonso and made it abundantly clear what he thought of his manager’s decision.",
      "“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?” Vinicius was heard shouting at Alonso as his No.7 appeared on the fourth official’s board.",
      "The 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes in just three of Madrid’s 12 games in all competitions this season and before making his way straight down the tunnel, he’s alleged to have muttered: “Always me! I’m Leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!”",
      "And according to AS, ‘the option of leaving’ is now ‘being seriously considered’ by Vinicius, who believes Alonso ‘doesn’t like him’ and that his ‘status isn’t respected’ by the Spaniard, with the growing rift between the pair a ‘massive problem’ for the club.",
      "Alonso looked to pacify the situation after the game, saying: “I’m taking away many positive things from Vini’s game and I don’t want to lose focus on what’s important.",
      "“He contributed a lot. It’s an important victory, a deserved one. Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.",
      "“Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.”",
      "The report adds that the Madrid hierarchy are prepared to back any decision Alonso makes with regard to Vinicius’ future having been far from impressed by the winger’s reaction to being subbed.",
      "And with it suggested last month that Vinicius may seek a January exit having been benched for Madrid’s Champions League opener, we can only assume his resolve to seek pastures new has gathered strength after this latest perceived snub.",
      "But the question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be the man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case. And there’s nowhere to go for him but Saudi Arabia.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain used to be a landing spot for the star misfits of other European giants, but they’ve become a serious football team of late.",
      "Liverpool made several Galactico signings in the summer, but to their cost so far this season, and we can’t see Arne Slot welcoming such a character into his dressing room.",

      "If anyone could get a handle on Vinicius, it might just be Pep Guardiola, but Manchester City haven’t typically chased players of such repute, other than Erling Haaland, who joined for the relatively meagre prices they’re used to paying for their recruits.",
      "Arsenal may still be after a left-wing upgrade, but much as we would enjoy his clash with Arteta, theirs is a boat that doesn’t need rocking.",
      "Manchester United aren’t in a position to attract a player of Vinicius’ quality even if they wanted to, and we can’t imagine they do at a point where Ruben Amorim looks finally to have his squad pulling together as one.",
      "There’s very little chance of Chelsea paying that much for a player who is on the brink of being too old for them anyway at 25, and even less chance of Vinicius joining a club where the chances of the most major trophies look slim in the short-term.",
      "And given there is no European club other than PSG outside the Premier League with the wherewithal to pay Real Madrid and Vinicius what’s required to sign him, even assuming they had the desire, if we were his advisors, and weren’t the money-grabbing so-and-sos we suspect they are, we would urge him to mend bridges which are currently singed at a club from which he has no better, or even remotely comparable, place to go, before he burns them beyond repair.",

      "Arsenal, Sunderland, Bruno Fernandes and Ezri Konsa are sitting pretty, but West Ham and Wolves are in abysmal states and Liverpool need more help.",
      "Here are your Premier League winners and losers starting with the…",
      "The time has come to stop viewing Sunderland through the prism of a newly promoted team. It underlines their immediately acclimatised brilliance to compare their results and performances to those who have come up from the Championship in recent years, but also does them a massive disservice and puts a natural ceiling on what they can achieve.",
      "This is, for all intents and purposes, a ready-made and proven Premier League side. They have remarkable depth – only four clubs have used more players so far – and can win games in a variety of ways.",
      "If they don’t catch you from a corner or a counter, Granit Xhaka will find an alternative route through or Wilson Isidor will exploit the space in behind.",
      "Regis Le Bris is fully subscribed to the power of long throws and set-pieces, but Sunderland have also scored more goals in open play than Arsenal and Newcastle, with just Arsenal, Brighton, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs boasting more different scorers. They have won matches with 54% and 32% possession.",
      "No club has gained more points from losing positions than a Sunderland side which has dropped none when winning. Sure, they have already passed the tallies of the last two teams to come up and finish bottom, but the Black Cats also have more points than Leicester did at this stage in 2015/16.",
      "They probably won’t win their seventh English top-flight title this season, but that qualifier being necessary for Sunderland about four years after they were in the midst of a losing run against Charlton, Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday in League One, when Le Bris was managing a French club’s B team and waiting for his first post at a senior level, is astonishing.",
      "",
      "It would have been a phenomenal weekend had they not even played, with Liverpool and Manchester City both falling to obstacles of a similar size and difficulty to facing Crystal Palace at home.",
      "Mikel Arteta told his players he “valued more this victory than any other victory this season because we knew the difficulty of it”. Palace are an obdurate opponent but at the end of an eight-day stretch in which they also faced Fulham away and Atletico Madrid at home, it was a substantial test of their mental strength and credentials.",
      "Arsenal did not concede a single goal in those games. Their majesty is built not on set-piece mastery but unmatched defensive excellence. They have kept five consecutive clean sheets and faced at least 13 fewer shots than any other team.",
      "Had Arsenal automatically conceded every shot on target they had allowed this season they would still be in the top half of the table with 13 points, while occupying a seeded Champions League knockout phase place. David Raya is more libero than goalkeeper at this point.",
      "Only four clubs in the entire history of the Premier League have conceded fewer than three goals after nine games – and that Chelsea 2005/06 side is not actually among them. A ludicrous record is in genuine jeopardy.",
      "",
      "Perhaps Arsenal won’t replace Mikel Arteta with Nicolas Jover, and Aston Villa might not promote Austin MacPhee to Unai Emery’s seat in the dugout. But the appointment of Keith Andrews as Brentford manager ahead of the season of the long throws seems like remarkable prescience.",
      "That is not to denigrate an entirely deserved win over the champions. As with Arsenal, the Brentford set-piece approach only works when underpinned by energy, bravery and clarity. It is designed to complement their quality rather than define it.",
      "Brentford are intelligent with their pressing, incisive when counter-attacking and committed in defence. Those are the foundations, not Michael Kayode launching it into the box.",
      "As Andy Robertson said, “you can’t come to Brentford away and just expect to play them off the park because they’re always going to be ready to fight”. But they can absolutely play too. You might say they are as adept at floating like a butterfly as they are stinging like the Bees if you were so inclined.",

      "It does feel like they’re doing Chelsea’s bit, just comfortably better.",
      "Bournemouth have the American owner, the multi-club system from which they are able to pluck the best talents, the focus on youth and the embrace of a player trading model which sees millions spent and recouped each year when it functions properly.",
      "But Bournemouth also have an exceptional coach to bring everything together, and a unity which seems to run all the way through the chain of command.",
      "Their only Premier League defeat this season was basically a case of poor timing; had they faced Liverpool at any other time beyond that opening weekend, Bournemouth might well have won.",
      "And the way in which Andoni Iraola has drilled these players to the extent that they are essentially interchangeable is ridiculous. Veljko Milosavljevic can already be trusted to deputise at 18 and Eli Junior Kroupi has stepped up incredibly well in place of Evanilson at 19.",
      "",
      "A stunning win for Burnley and Scott Parker, but what an absolutely breath-taking last-minute save to secure it. James Trafford could never.",
      "",
      "That late shift of his body to block a Phil Foden through ball into Erling Haaland was sublime. It felt like a replay of the sort of goal Manchester City have scored habitually over the years, doctored to show how it could theoretically be prevented.",
      "It is impossible to do justice to the levels of concentration and fitness required to pull that off in the 86th minute of a match Konsa dominated before and after too. He and Amadou Onana were fantastic.",
      "READ NEXT: Liverpool could lose £35m windfall after ‘selfish’ player dropped before stunning win",
      "",
      "Ao Tanaka admitted he was “not good enough at the moment” having only recently recovered from an injury, although he did also say every Premier League game is “difficult” as “the opponents are so good” after facing Nuno’s West Ham so he might not be the most reliable narrator.",
      "Perhaps only Ange Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest and Vitor Pereira’s Wolves have been easier assignment in this season’s top flight, and Leeds were lucky enough to face and beat the latter too.",
      "Only five clubs have picked up more points against sides currently in the bottom half; winning these six-pointers is a handy knack for Daniel Farke’s side to develop.",
      "And the remarkably potent combination of Tanaka and Elland Road could be key. The Japan international made his 20th home start for Leeds and the Whites have won 18 of those games, with draws against West Brom and Swansea in March the only exceptions.",
      "Tanaka might not be able to match the physicality of his teammates, but his more technical side can give Leeds a dimension they sometimes lack.",
      "",
      "For the first time since April 13, a run stretching back 17 matches, Newcastle have won a Premier League game in which they also conceded. Each of their last five victories had been to nil but this was overdue proof they can just about strike a balance between defence and attack.",
      "With clean sheets on the agenda, the Rafa Benitez ‘short blanket’ analogy again comes to mind. He frequently spoke of the inherent difficulty in finding an equilibrium between keeping the ball out of one net and scoring in the other. “If you cover your head, you have your feet cold, but if you cover your feet, you have your head cold,” he would say at a time when managing a club owned by Mike Ashley meant he was fortunate to have the choice between the two.",
      "This version of Newcastle is far closer to that than the We’ll Score One More Than You energy of Kevin Keegan, with seemingly only Liverpool able to evoke the free-scoring spirit of The Entertainers. But Eddie Howe will delight in seeing his side finally learn how to convert a score draw into a win.",
      "",
      "There is no bigger swing between a Premier League team’s PPG home and away this season. Spurs will need to bring their form in north London more in line with that everywhere else at some point but it is handy to develop a knack for winning every other week.",
      "And Guglielmo Vicario has already matched his Premier League clean sheet tally from last season. What a club.",
      "",
      "The face swaps are imminent. West Ham and Nuno might have felt like a perfect marriage born out of opportunism but in less than a month both have been given cause to regret their decisions.",
      "Nuno has accepted the keys to a broken home. West Ham are a complete mess, a picture of complacency and hubris being steered aimlessly by individuals who seemed to believe they were somehow above or insulated from this sort of crisis.",
      "If this ship cannot be turned around or prevented from inevitably capsizing, it will be difficult to think of a more disastrous line of managerial succession than Moyes-Lopetegui-Potter-Nuno. The middle two have since taken up international coaching roles, so harrowing was their last club experience.",
      "And of course West Ham now apparently plan to solve their myriad problems with a busy and ambitious January transfer window, as if their head of recruitment wasn’t sacked earlier this month and they didn’t spend well over £100m in the summer on players the majority of whom apparently cannot be trusted to start.",
      "Nuno dropped Mateus Fernandes – who came on to score – while once again almost completely ignoring Soungoutou Magassa until it was entirely too late.",
      "After making three half-time substitutions in the last game, Nuno changed his formation in the 25th minute having already conceded twice at Elland Road. He seemed to crack the code in his first match but the manager has taken some bizarre steps backwards since.",
      "Nuno insisted his recent changes in team selection and systems did not constitute “experiments” but there are few other explanations for picking inverted full-backs on the wrong side, naming a midfield of Tomas Soucek and Andy Irving or continuing to deploy Lucas Paqueta as a false nine.",
      "Games against Brentford and Leeds had to be circled as opportunities for West Ham to build momentum in a quick five-day burst but instead it has destroyed whatever hope and expectation the club seemed to have, and rendered Nuno a shambles of confused ideas and poor career choices.",
      "",
      "It feels terminal and irreversible at this stage, with the slow death of Wolves as a Premier League club to be stretched out over seven more agonising months.",
      "The manager and captain for the day likely went over to irate fans at full time to try and ease tensions but it seemed to only exacerbate the split between the club and its supporters.",
      "How can Vitor Pereira understand “frustrations” which overlap multiple seasons when he has not been here for a full year yet? Can Jorgen Strand Larsen really empathise with the plight of a club he tried to leave in the summer?",
      "Wolves have mustered two points in nine games and already lost to all three promoted clubs. But this is not the result of a single bad summer; it is the culmination of a controlled and sustained downgrade of the squad through annual asset-stripping.",
      "Only for so long could they get away with habitually selling their best players and replacing them with rank unknowns at a fraction of the price. Wolves have been sleepwalking into this relegation for a couple of years but must now live through the rest of this nightmare.",
      "And if anyone of a Wolves persuasion wants to take any encouragement from John Textor’s interest in buying out Fosun, have a quick talk with Crystal Palace fans first.",
      "",
      "It is a stunning reflection of 18th-placed Nottingham Forest that the manager they so covet is in 17th and the one they sacked is 19th.",
      "The visit of Wolves to Craven Cottage on Saturday is magnitudinal and potentially season-defining.",
      "Silva could do with rediscovering his touch when it comes to making goalscoring substitutions, but at least one selection from the start against Newcastle was sub-optimal in hindsight.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe will be consigned to the bench again after being taken off at half-time of his first Premier League start this season. Calvin Bassey perhaps ought to be after marking his return to the XI in place of Jorge Cuenca by conceding possession for both goals. Not ideal.",
      "",
      "The first team in English top-flight history to win their opening five matches of a season before losing their next four.",
      "“It is definitely that teams have a certain playing style against us. It is a very good strategy to play. We have not found an answer yet,” is a remarkable thing for the manager of the reigning champions to say.",
      "",
      "Just a thoroughly unreliable institution, incapable of properly building on a galvanising victory over the champions or a consummate thrashing of European royalty.",
      "It must be maddening for Chelsea but then this sort of result is always possible with such an inexperienced group of players being guided by a coach still relatively unseasoned at this level.",
      "That second Sunderland goal should not happen, and doesn’t with any sort of leadership or responsibility being taken in defence. An opposition centre-forward cannot set up camp in the penalty area for five seconds from a long ball and wait for reinforcements while holding one defender at literal arm’s length as another watches.",
      "Between that, the concession of a goal from a long throw and the glee with which Isidor explained how he carried out the full Steed Malbranque on Claude Makelele treatment against Moises Caicedo to shut the hosts down at Stamford Bridge, there was yet more evidence that this is still a Chelsea side far closer to the start of a project than the end.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola has been warning of an overreliance on Erling Haaland. When the opposition isolates and nullifies him so masterfully there should be a raft of players desperate to step up and take responsibility.",
      "Instead, Manchester City have lost both of the Premier League games Haaland hasn’t scored in to nil this season. That won’t be nearly close enough to compete for the title this season.",
      "",
      "The wait for consecutive wins goes on. Who wants to live in a world which doesn’t feature Brighton ransacking Old Trafford on an annual basis?",
      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side are stranded at the bottom of one particularly damning table and it is difficult not to see their stuttering start as a quite considerable step back from previous seasons.",
      "The Carlos Baleba situation in particular might have reached the point of necessary intervention. With Manchester United focusing on Premier League-proven talent again in the transfer market this was a glorious opportunity for the £100m target to follow in the footsteps of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha by impressing against his prospective future employers.",
      "What instead transpired was a deleted social media post and yet another early substitution after being booked. Any audition that results in being shown up by Casemiro and taken off for James Milner in 2025 has not gone well.",
      "",
      "An incredible coach but presumably a terrible poker player. Glasner has one massive tell: if he is breathing he will dig out the Crystal Palace hierarchy for leaving it too late to make signings.",
      "In fairness, it must be especially frustrating considering he specifically warned against it in public and Palace are locked in a midweek-to-weekend European grind which makes adaptation difficult for players.",
      "Palace have perhaps not coincidentally lost both of the Premier League games they have played immediately after Conference League matches.",
      "But Glasner does also need to shoulder some responsibility here. Seven players have started every Palace game – no club has more – and played basically every minute. And most of those have barely been given a Conference League rest either. The manager either has to rotate more or accept some understandably tired performances.",

      "I remember years back John Nicholson writing an article about how there were many ways to play football, and none of them were objectively the ‘right’ way. I think this was in response to everyone trying to play like Pep’s Barcelona and failing miserably, but the point still stands. Besides, this Arsenal side do also play some very easy on the eye football.",
      "Also, as a United fan, I started the season with the uncomfortable realisation that it was Liverpool, City or Arsenal for the title, and as such only one vaguely palatable option. Sure, Liverpool seem to have messed it up and City are hardly flying (although if they are in touching distance come Christmas then watch out), but Arsenal were and are the least bad (realistic) option from a United perspective.\nJack (Very quickly falling in love with Mbeumo) Manchester",

You’re shit and you know you are.",

We’ll have a clearer idea by the end of the season how Liverpool are going to be under Slot in the mid term. God only knows how long the death of a friend and colleague will hurt the team for.",

Dispelling the hoodoo of not winning at Anfield for 10 years then getting a win against a team that we’d lost 6 of the last 7 to has rightly given United fans and hopefully the team a nice lift. However, as a fairly staunch Amorim advocate I think we need to hold off on the ‘we told you so’ rhetoric to those who wanted him sacked.",
      "Firstly, it not like they didn’t have good reason. The team have been awful at times and Amorim is certainly accountable for a portion of that. Given the last year’s worth of evidence thinking a change of manager is needed wasn’t an unreasonable position to take. Also, United still haven’t won a game in the way the manager ideally wants so it’s difficult to point at these results and say ‘look how well it’s working’.",
      "Against Liverpool we had significantly less possession. Against Brighton 70% of the shots were on target. Across both games we ended up scoring 6 goals from an xG of about 2.6. There was definitely an element of making the most of the chances we created and setting up to counter the opponent, both of which won’t work every time.",
      "Having said that the underlying attacking numbers for this season are really positive. 1st for shots on target, 2nd for total shots attempted, and 3rd for shots in the box. 14 non penalty goals from a non penalty xG of 14.3 shows we’re performing as expected and this is backed up by a shot conversion rate of 45% and goal conversion of 11% both of which are fairly average and thus hopefully sustainable.",
      "The defending numbers still show plenty of room for improvement. Being 15th for goals conceded and 16th for xG conceded looks worrying but this is somewhat distorted by having played both City and Liverpool away from home (accounting for about 40% of that xGc total). Sitting 7th for total shots conceded is probably a more reliable indicator for our defensive performance so far which is probably about where we’ll end up.",
      "Whilst the team have looked better in the last few weeks the style of play hasn’t changed significantly all season. Amorim may have decided to be a little more pragmatic and more training times seem to be helping but a lot of the improvement in attack has come from buying significantly better attackers. There still isn’t a settled effective system for winning games and the only win achieved whilst dominating possession was against Burnley which ended up too close for comfort anyway.",
      "I’m cautiously optimistic for the rest of this season and looking ahead to the next. Stats, performance, and confidence are all trending upwards, albeit slowly. Yet don’t be despondent if we look awful again in the next game, that’s what it will be like for a while yet, patchy and inconsistent. With a few more points some good will in the bank it will be interesting to see over the next set of games if Amorim returns to his high possession model or sticks with a more opponent specific approach.\nDave, Manchester (4 more wins by Christmas and I’m happy)",

That situation is the fabled: oh he’s got a touch on the ball.",
      "Most famously we see it in the goalkeeper closing in to an incoming striker. Certainly the coverage and VAR replays seem to suggest if said goalkeeper touches the ball in any way, that absolves them of any subsequent impact. Certainly the reference to Taylor’s masterclass on Saturday is the same: there is no doubt whatsoever that Amad is not just fouled but fouled so hard the defender gets up rubbing his shin, but because the ball maybe came into the area of his studs, no foul.",
      "My point is simply this: that’s not the rule right? Just because you touch the ball, you do not have carte blanche to kick a player? In the Amad case, sure maybe the defender touched the ball but he didn’t change the path and Amad is now past him with a shot on goal, if not being taken out completely. Same with most of the goalie situations – maybe they touched it but the striker is now past them and still able to get the ball if not for being flipped into the air.\nRyan, Bermuda (winning a game involving Taylor AND Oliver should count for 6 points)",

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played four lost four in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become a seven-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "Liverpool now also trail in forlornly behind Bournemouth, Tottenham, Sunderland, Manchester City and – most humiliating of all – Manchester United.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",

      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",

It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",

      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces.",
      "Arsenal and the rest of the Premier League are boring one journalist while another wants Liverpool to drop their captain.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",

      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",

      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Have got to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Tuesday 28 October 2025 14:51, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (7), Shaw (6), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Heaven (7), Dorgu (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a). \n\n\nBrighton: Verbruggen (6), De Cuyper (6), Dunk (5), Van Hecke (5), Wieffer (6), Ayari (6), Baleba (5), Minteh (6), Rutter (6), Kadioglu (6), Welbeck (7).\n\n\nSubs: Watson (6), Milner (6), Gomez (6), Kostoulas (6), Tzimas (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
