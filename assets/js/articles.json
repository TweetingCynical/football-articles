      "Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson has issued a stark warning to Manchester United against appointing Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner should Ruben Amorim get the boot. Amorim finds himself under mounting pressure following a dismal start to the campaign.",
      "The Reds have managed just two wins - a chaotic clash with Burnley and a fortnight ago against ten-man Chelsea. Saturday's crushing defeat at Brentford has cranked up the heat on the United chief, with numerous reports suggesting Amorim could be heading for the exit door if things don't improve.",
      "Whilst the manager remains in his post for now, question marks hang over his future should United stumble against Sunderland this weekend. Several candidates have been touted for the United hot seat if Amorim gets his marching orders, with Glasner amongst the frontrunners after his remarkable work at Palace.",
      "\"He's a brilliant manager,\" the pundit acknowledged. \"He doesn't get too up and doesn't get too down.",
      "\"It's very impressive. He's put a team together and they are all very comfortable in their positions.",
      "\"Everyone knows their job in the team. Let's say Ruben Amorim was manager at Palace now, he'd have half a chance of being a success.",
      "\"Palace have the players to play three at the back. They have the attributes in their squad to play in that system.",
      "\"For me, that's why I'd be concerned about Glasner going to Man United. He's a three-at-the-back man and it is being proven that it is a system that just doesn't fit the players at Man United.",
      "\"Glasner is not a good fit for Man United. Of course, I'm sure he'd be adaptable, and he's proven with how he handles the players, but the system he uses is just all wrong for United - Amorim can tell you that.\"",
      "Merson's comments came as it emerged that Glasner declined a new contract at Palace back in the summer, as per BBC Sport. Glasner was unhappy with Palace's approach in the transfer market, and the club's chances of keeping hold of him beyond the end of the season are now reportedly deemed 'remote' following internal talks.",
      "Should Glasner not be in the running for the hotseat at Old Trafford, other potential candidates for the United position include former England boss Gareth Southgate, ex-Barcelona chief Xavi and AFC Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Amorim is scheduled to address the press on Friday before the fixture against Sunderland.",

      "Manchester United chiefs reportedly gave thought to turning to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before landing Ruben Amorim last year. Amorim was hired in November as a replacement for Erik ten Hag and arrived with a stellar reputation from Sporting Lisbon, but he now finds himself under intense pressure as he approaches a year in the job.",
      "The Portuguese boss has won just 18 of his 49 games in charge of United and endured a nightmare debut campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final. With no European football this season, there was added emphasis on domestic success, but defeat by League Two Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and a stuttering start in the Premier League has seen his position questioned again.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner, who has led his side to an unbeaten start this season and won the FA Cup in May, is among those being considered by United’s hierarchy. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos team were behind the appointment of Amorim, who they believed was a coup, having been so successful with Sporting.",
      "They moved for him after sacking Ten Hag just months after handing the Dutchman a new contract. And the muddled thinking is shown by the fact that bringing back Solskjaer was given fleeting consideration, according to The Sun.",
      "Former United striker Solskjaer was sacked by United in November 2021 after nearly three years in charge. He was available last November and remains well liked at the club due to his personality and history as both a player and manager.",
      "Solskjaer is also a proud United alumni, having scored 126 goals in 366 games as a player and won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League. Even under the dire circumstances in which he was sacked as manager, the statement United released showed the depth of feeling between the two parties.",
      "“Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,” the statement said. “Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future.",
      "“His place in the club’s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.”",
      "Solskjaer is once again available, having been sacked by Besiktas in August after seven months with the Turkish club and was reportedly back in the Manchester area this week. While United insist they haven’t lined up replacements for Amorim, who faces a crucial game against Sunderland on Saturday, they know the Norwegian would be interested in the job.",
      "Speaking at Oslo Business Forum last year, Solskjaer underlined his feelings on the job. \"If the family (United) asks, I would say yes every day of the week,\" he said. \"It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",

      "Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez could be lured to Manchester United if Ruben Amorim is given the boot, according to former Premier League ace Gaizka Mendieta.",
      "Amorim's reign at Old Trafford has been far from smooth sailing since he took over the reins in November, following Erik ten Hag's departure. The 40-year-old manager led the Red Devils to a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season and this term hasn't started much better.",
      "With just two wins from their first six league matches and a humiliating Carabao Cup second-round exit against Grimsby Town, the pressure is mounting on Amorim. This has sparked rumours about his future, with several high-profile names being touted as potential replacements - including Xavi.",
      "Xavi, who boasts an impressive eight La Liga titles with Barcelona both as a player and a manager, has been out of work since Hansi Flick replaced him at Camp Nou last May. Despite only having five years of managerial experience, Mendieta, a former team-mate at club and international level, believes Xavi would relish the opportunity to bring success back to United.",
      "In a chat with OLGB, the ex-Valencia and Middlesbrough star said of Xavi: \"I think if it's the right project, he will be tempted. Who doesn't want to coach in the Premier League?",
      "\"Who would not want to coach Manchester United, even if it's in a difficult time? He won trophies at Barca during a very peculiar period of history of the club and he changed that.",
      "\"Of course, he doesn't know Manchester United as he knows Barca, but he's been there, he knows that, he's capable of doing those things. So if the project seems right to him, I'm sure he will take it.",
      "\"He's been preparing himself already, waiting for the chance to come. I know he's had a few options to go and coach, but it wasn't the right project.",
      "\"I think for a coach like him, it's the project that matters, not only the history and the club. A lot of people were hesitant in his move to Barca because he had only been in Qatar.",
      "\"People thought he wasn't ready, then he won the league and the Super Cup in his first season. I think football has changed a lot. The coaches and players tend to adapt.",
      "\"It's at an incredibly high level and it's a lot faster because people are more prepared. There's more tools out there for coaches to gain an understanding, knowing what's happening at other clubs and with other players.",
      "\"He has his own platforms to understand and analyse situations. So wherever he goes, which could be Man Utd, he'll be prepared for the job he takes for sure.\"",
      "Whilst there has been no indication that Amorim is presently in danger of losing his position, the hierarchy will undoubtedly expect swift improvements in form, with ambitions of bringing an end to a decade of disappointment at Old Trafford.",
      "With a challenging line-up of matches against newly promoted Sunderland, reigning champions Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest, and Tottenham on the horizon, Amorim's United squad will have their work cut out as they strive to regain momentum.",

      "Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat after a disappointing start to the season for Manchester United. The Portuguese has only managed to secure 19 victories from 49 games during his first 11 months at the helm.",
      "Despite guiding the team to the Europa League final, he has struggled to make an impact on the domestic front. After a dismal 15th-place finish in the 2024/25 season, United are currently languishing in 14th position this term, with a mere two wins from six matches.",
      "If Amorim gets the boot, Gareth Southgate would reportedly turn down any offer from United. The former England manager was previously one of the top candidates to take over at United in March 2024.",
      "Although Southgate's commitment to England ahead of the European Championship put a stop to United's plans to enter discussions at that time, he is currently without a club. However, the Daily Star reports that Southgate is in no hurry to return to football and is keeping his options open.",
      "Interestingly, Southgate is good mates with Dan Ashworth. The former United sporting director had a long-term plan to bring Southgate to Old Trafford during his tenure, but left after just five months.",
      "\"He's been in the hot seat for coming up to a year, and he's had a transfer window, but you can't see any signs of improvement. There have been one or two matches where we've seen flashes of potential; they [United] played quite well against Arsenal on the opening day, but still lost.",
      "\"I've never seen a manager conduct their business the way that Ruben Amorim is at the moment. It's a well-trodden path about his system and the fact that it maybe doesn't suit a lot of the players.",
      "\"But you're not telling me he shouldn't be doing better, even with that system. You look at the players at the back - Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire - Bruno Fernandes going forward, [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got good players.",
      "\"It doesn't look like the right fit, and that's putting it mildly. There's a lot of talk that they're not going to sack him until a certain date towards the end of this year to save a pay-off. It's difficult to read the minds of the hierarchy at United as to what they're thinking, but I think they know, and everyone will be telling them that it is time for a change.\"",
      "Few seem convinced that Amorim's position remains secure, with journalist Fabrizio Romano indicating that, whilst the manager won't face immediate dismissal, forthcoming fixtures could prove decisive. \"I'm not here saying that Amorim is absolutely safe,\" he said.",
      "\"Amorim's job is not absolutely safe at the moment because they need to perform in a different way because Man United want to see results. But it doesn't mean that Manchester United have met with Southgate or already started the process to appoint Gareth Southgate as new boss.",
      "\"So let's wait, let's see what happens. But for sure, the next games will be important for Ruben Amorim.\"",
      "Amorim might have just one additional month to persuade United bosses he deserves backing. Reports previously suggested that United could postpone any dismissal of Amorim until he completes a year in charge, owing to the significant compensation package he would be entitled to.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United would face a substantial £12m bill should they axe the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months in charge. Conversely, there are worries that Amorim might be the one to trigger his departure.",
      "United's co-owners, Ineos, are reportedly concerned that their manager could opt to quit before facing the sack in an attempt to protect his managerial standing. He is reputed to grow increasingly exasperated by the relentless criticism following defeats.",
      "As per The i Newspaper, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are ready to back their manager, but Amorim may soon need to consider resigning to 'preserve his managerial career'. The United boss believes that evaluations of United's losses can be 'knee-jerk' reactions and is allegedly surprised by the intense scrutiny over his managerial tenure.",

Glasner is hot property right now, having masterminded Palace’s FA Cup final win and made an unbeaten start to the season, with Manchester United among the interested onlookers.",
      "The 51-year-old has been in charge of Palace since February 2024, when he replaced Roy Hodgson, and has completely changed the club’s trajectory. He has lost just 15 of his 71 matches in charge of the Eagles, bringing a first major trophy in their history by beating Manchester City at Wembley in May.",
      "The fact that captain Marc Guehi’s contract expires on June 30 has been well documented after the defender saw a £35million move to Liverpool collapse on deadline day. But Glasner is in the same boat, with his contract also only having nine months left on it.",
      "BBC Sport reports that Glasner was offered a contract extension over the summer, yet he declined to sign it, preferring to wait until the end of the transfer window. Glasner was openly critical of Palace’s approach in the transfer market and threatened to resign if the club sold Guehi without finding a replacement.",
      "Palace’s low-key window could ultimately lead to Glasner’s departure because it didn’t match his personal ambitions. The club brought in just five players, two of whom came on free transfers, and only Yeremy Pino has made an impact so far this season.",
      "The chances of Palace keeping Glasner beyond the end of the season are reportedly deemed ‘remote’ following internal discussions. The club will try to persuade him otherwise, but it seems that he could jump ship to a different club who are able to match the success he had at Eintracht Frankfurt, where he won the Europa League in 2022.",
      "Manchester United are keeping an eye on Glasner, who would be a good fit were they to replace Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss has won just 18 of his 49 games in charge and is under huge pressure following the 3-1 defeat by Brentford last weekend which left United 14th in the Premier League with two wins from their opening six games.",
      "While Glasner is being considered as a potential replacement, United stress that they remain committed to Amorim ahead of a crunch match against Sunderland on Saturday afternoon. The fact that the Austrian is coming to the end of his deal and plays a similar three-man defence makes him an obvious target for Ineos should they sack Amorim.",

      "After a shaky start at Barcelona, Rashford has found his stride since the September international break. In fact, he's either scored or assisted in each of his last six matches for Barca.",

      "As Manchester United's early-season struggles persist, manager Ruben Amorim has come under fire for his tactical decisions and team selections. Amorim’s biggest critics have questioned whether his squad is suited to the 3-4-2-1 formation that the Portuguese boss insists on using.",
      "That has resulted in three losses in six Premier League matches and an early exit from the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town. Yet, questions also linger about United's summer recruitment strategy, particularly whether the Red Devils' spending of over £200million on six new players was wise.",
      "INEOS missed out on several key targets before bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. And we now turn our attention to three high-profile players that Amorim failed to sign and how they've fared since their Old Trafford move failed.",
      "Liverpool pipping Newcastle to the £79m transfer of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt received plenty of attention. But the Anfield club also managed to thwart an attempt by their fierce rivals Manchester United to swoop in for the striker at the eleventh hour.",
      "The Athletic reported that those in power at Old Trafford tried to stun Liverpool by making a late bid for the Frenchman during the transfer window. However, by that point, Ekitike had already committed his future to the reigning Premier League champions.",
      "Since then, United have been left to rue Ekitike's decision, as the forward has wasted no time in settling into English football. He's managed to bag five goals in nine appearances while impressing with his overall link-up play. After failing to bring in other forward options like Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap, Amorim eventually signed Sesko for an initial £66.3m, but the Slovenian has struggled, scoring just one goal so far.",
      "The Aston Villa goalkeeper was rumoured to be on the verge of a deadline day move to Old Trafford following a series of blunders from United keepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana at the start of the season. Martinez even appeared to have said his Villa goodbyes and was dropped by Unai Emery.",
      "But despite showing interest in the Argentine shot-stopper, the Red Devils decided to sign Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens for £18.2m instead. That was due to Lammens' younger age profile, lower wages and the hefty £40m Villa were demanding for their ageing World Cup winner.",
      "Central midfield has long been viewed as a problematic position in United's squad, and Brighton’s 21-year-old starlet Carlos Baleba was identified as an upgrade in early August. Despite reports of United intermediaries making contact with the Seagulls over a potential deal, Brighton chief Paul Barber denied those claims and dismissed the transfer links as “speculation”.",
      "Brighton had reportedly demanded over £100m for the Cameroonian, who they wanted to keep for another year at least. That valuation proved too steep for United to meet as their interest eventually faded.",
      "The dynamic midfielder has continued as a regular starter for Brighton, featuring in eight matches across all competitions, though he has yet to play a complete 90 minutes or contribute a goal or assist. Having been among their most reliable performers last campaign, his showings haven't been as impressive this season, with the player appearing to be going through the motions.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler admitted after the 2-2 draw with Tottenham that Baleba is still not 100 per cent physically. \"Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he's a very young player,\" the Brighton head coach said. \"He's not a machine. He needs help from us. He tried everything today; he only had 45 minutes in his body, and it's something that we have to accept.\"",
      "Hurzeler also spoke about whether transfer speculation has affected the Cameroon international. \"It's all a lot of theory,\" he said. \"We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there's interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he's not saying; 'It affects me', maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.”",

      "Hojlund, who was shipped out on loan to Naples following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford, has made an impressive start with the Serie A champions",
      "The Red Devils pocketed a tidy £5.2million loan fee for the striker, with the deal to become permanent for £38m, if certain conditions are met.",
      "Manchester City legend De Bruyne, who set up both of Hojlund's goals, heaped praise on the forward in a post-match interview with UEFA, saying: \"Rasmus has a lot of quality and as a striker when you go forward you need that smell of goals - it's really important for him and the team.",
      "Speaking to Corriere dello Sport, De Bruyne added: \"I was trying to get into that space for the first goal and was waiting for the right moment to pass it to Rasmus, luckily he did the rest. I think Rasmus is growing a lot and is very similar to [Erling] Haaland.\"",
      "The midfielder was pressed about that comparison, and said: \"I think they are very similar because they both like to attack the depth. Maybe Hojlund comes to play the ball towards us more, but I think he needs to attack the space a lot because he can score and give us a big hand.\"",
      "Hojlund himself said: \"It was the night you dream of, playing in the Champions League. I celebrated touching the Napoli badge because I'm happy to play here and the Champions League badge because I love to score in Europe.",
      "\"Playing with an exceptional talent like Kevin De Bruyne is special. I just need to get into space and he'll get me the ball.\"",
      "The striker then posted a cheeky message on social media: \"Hojlund scores twice in the Champions League after two assists from Kevin De Bruyne was not on my 2025 bingo card.\"",
      "United splashed out £72m to bring Hojlund from Atalanta during the summer of 2023. The promising forward netted 16 times across all competitions during his debut campaign, though he managed a mere four Premier League strikes last term.",
      "Amorim failed to include Hojlund in any matchday squad this season and he departed for Napoli on transfer deadline day. Napoli manager Antonio Conte swooped for Hojlund following an injury blow to ex-United frontman Romelu Lukaku.",

      "The transfer window might have been shut for over a month but Manchester United are still hard at work getting deals done. The Red Devils remain keen to add new faces to their squad.",
      "Cristian Orozco looks set to become the latest to complete a move to Old Trafford, with reports suggesting that United are on the verge of sealing a deal for his services. An agreement has been reached with his current side for a deal worth around $1million (£741,000).",
      "The 17-year-old will officially move to England next summer, with his arrival signalling the next stage of the club’s plan to hoover up some of the most promising young talent in the world. Diego Leon, Sekou Kone, Chido Obi Martin and many more have already been tempted to move to the North West.",
      "Orozco is a young midfielder currently plying his trade for Colombian side Fortaleza. He only joined his current side from Rojo FC in the summer.",
      "He is a slightly more defensive minded midfielder. Orozco has already made an impact on the international stage, having made nine appearances for the Colombia under-19 side.",
      "A lot has already been said about Orozco despite his tender years. One of his former coaches, Álvaro Escobar, said: \"He has a positive leadership style that has allowed him to be captain of the Colombian national team. He expresses himself well and is receptive.",
      "\"He doesn't get upset when corrected; it's a pleasure to coach him.\" Escobar shared his delight when he found out about the switch to Old Trafford: \"I was very happy when I found out he could go to Manchester United.\"",
      "Campo Elías Santacruz has also been full of praise. He added: “With his character and playing style, he established himself in the U15 and U17 teams. Despite being so young, he always showed leadership in practice.",
      "Where will Man United finish in the Premier League this season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "\"He trained hard and, on and off the field, acted like a young man with experience. His teammates helped him grow, and today we can say he's a great human being.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Orozco himself has also spoken out. Amid speculation that he could move to Old Trafford, he wrote on social media: “La buena pa’ todos, bendiciones”, which translates roughly to, “Good for everyone, blessings”, alongside an image of Diego Maradona.",
      "Despite a deal being close, it appears that it might be some time before United fans get to see him in action. United are not allowed to formally complete a deal until he turns 18, which will likely see him move to Old Trafford next summer. Even before then, club chiefs still have to complete the formalities of any deal.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has suffered another torrid few days following last weekend's crushing defeat to Brentford in the Premier League. That was the fourth time United have been beaten in this campaign already, with the looming clash against Sunderland now crucial to ease the mounting pressure on his position.",
      "Despite losing 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium and links to potential replacements, Amorim retains the backing of United's hierarchy, but time could be running out. There was at least one bright spot from Saturday as Benjamin Sesko found the target.",
      "He has joined fellow summer arrival Bryan Mbeumo in netting his maiden goal for the club, though Matheus Cunha has not scored yet.",
      "That forward trio took the places of Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony in the United ranks.",
      "Those five stars were all considered expendable by Amorim, but several are already appearing to vindicate that call as misguided. Since returning to Real Betis, Antony has bagged a goal and assist, whilst Sancho has impressed in brief appearances for Aston Villa.",
      "Nevertheless, it is the influence of the remaining trio in Champions League encounters that has been most telling, all whilst United gear up for their next fixture.",
      "Garnacho proved instrumental to Chelsea's match-winning strike against Benfica on Tuesday, with his delivery deflected into his own goal by Richard Rios. The Argentine has subsequently shared an Instagram story with the caption: \"Champions League nights.\"",
      "Just a day later, Rashford set up Ferran Torres' goal for Barcelona against Paris Saint-Germain with a beautifully timed pass. Despite the European champions taking the win, Rashford impressed throughout the match, marking his sixth goal contribution since his move - a clear signal to Amorim.",
      "Hojlund also cheekily celebrated after a precise finish with his weaker right foot and a courageous headed goal in Napoli's 2-1 victory over Sporting CP, with ex-Manchester City ace Kevin De Bruyne providing both assists.",
      "Upon celebrating his first goal, the Danish star pointed to the Champions League badge on his Napoli jersey.",
      "With three United cast-offs shining in recent matches, it's certainly a worrying sign for Amorim, particularly following United's disappointing result.",

      "The biggest Champions League fixture of the season so far certainly delivered as Barcelona hosted Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday evening. The Catalan giants struck first after 19 minutes, with Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford setting up Ferran Torres with a sublime through-ball to break the deadlock.",
      "Following his heroics in Barcelona's Champions League opener against Newcastle, where he netted a stunning brace, the England international's assist took his tally to seven goal contributions across nine outings since his summer move, as well as his third assist in as many matches.",
      "AS characterised Rashford's display as \"very active and dynamic on the left flank\". That assessment rang true, with the attacker managing 37 touches in total, eight inside the penalty area and two successful take-ons.",
      "He was also effective in his duels, winning three before being taken off for Robert Lewandowski in the 72nd minute. However, the outlet also mentioned that he needed to be more precise with his final actions in the second half.",
      "Mundo Deportivo praised the 27-year-old's impressive assist tally as he seems to be settling well into life under Flick in Catalonia. The publication noted the brilliance of his incisive pass to set up Torres, having spotted a gap in the PSG defence which he exploited with a perfectly-timed through ball after receiving the ball from Pedri.",
      "His \"dangerous\" movement off the ball was also commended, having had two potential scoring opportunities. One arrived early on when Torres chose to shoot rather than square the ball after rounding the keeper.",
      "Another pass in the second period might have presented Rashford with a simple tap-in, but it was cut out. The Spanish outlet did acknowledge, however, that Rashford’s role had faded by the time of his substitution.",
      "El Des Marque labelled Rashford as one of Barcelona's standout performers on the evening, with his 7.5 match rating surpassing that of Pedri's (6), Lamine Yamal's (7) and goal-scorer Torres' (6), which showcased his excellent overall impact.",
      "The outlet stated: \"Rashford continues his good assist streak, today with the first assist for Ferran Torres. He made several dangerous plays with dribbles and crosses and didn't stop trying until his substitution.\"",
      "That is certainly a credit to Flick for getting the former Red Devils star to buy into his tactics, something Ruben Amorim failed to achieve. It is especially promising given that Rashford has been accused of perhaps not giving his all in the past, particularly on the defensive end.",

      "He departed - along with Fergie - in 2013 with the next 12 years seeing the Red Devils slip further and further into mediocrity.",
      "And after their worst-ever Premier League finish last season, the signs are ominous for more struggles under current boss Ruben Amorim. Defeat to Brentford last time out was their third in six games, leaving them marooned in the bottom half.",
      "United’s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney said earlier this week that he thinks the ‘soul has gone’ from the football club and that a new engine was required to get it moving again.",
      "Meulensteen offered an equally damning appraisal, suggesting that the issues far extend their desperate struggles on the pitch - pointing some of the blame at United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Appearing on Footy Accumulators No Tippy Tappy Football Podcast he said: “The club is broken in two ways. Everybody can see that they’re broken on the pitch, they come up against Brentford with a new manager, they’re finding their feet. If it was under [Thomas] Frank, you would know you’re in for a game against Brentford, he will throw the kitchen sink at you.",
      "“Credit to Brentford, because they had a game plan and it worked a treat, and Manchester United has got zero ability to turn that around to some extent. They’re broken there.",
      "“The club is also broken, off the field. The culture that I was part of and that Sir Alex built was a fantastic culture to be a part of, and it was a family, everybody together. Everybody was looking after each other, and everybody felt valued to some extent.",
      "“All those things that have happened in the background, with the ownership, with Jim Ratcliffe coming in, the redundancies, the whole culture Alex Ferguson built for 26 years has been completely stripped away.”",
      "Rooney spoke similarly about the culture at Old Trafford and the impact of the wholesale changes and job losses implemented since INEOS’ acquired a stake in the club.",
      "\"I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting, I don't see character, I don't see desire to win,” he said on the Wayne Rooney Podcast.",

      "\"It's not even just results on the pitch. It's everything about the club that needs fixing - Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have walked into a real challenge.",
      "\"We're seeing staff members getting sacked after 20, 30 years who are very important people to that football club. The soul has gone from the club. It needs a new engine, a new lease of life. It needs something to kickstart that football club.\"",

      "Napoli had both Manchester clubs to thank for their Champions League win against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday. The Italian club's 2-1 victory came courtesy of a brace from Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund, with both efforts crafted by Manchester City legend Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Hojlund, who also found the net on his Serie A bow for the club, has flourished since leaving Old Trafford. The 22-year-old's opener arrived as De Bruyne surged forward to spark a counter-attack from a corner kick.",
      "The Belgian playmaker threaded a perfectly-weighted pass into Hojlund's stride, with the striker coolly dispatching the ball past the goalkeeper. It was a far cry from Hojlund's struggles in front of goal in a United shirt.",
      "Antonio Conte's men did encounter some resistance as Sporting managed to level from the penalty spot just past the hour mark. Nevertheless, the partnership between De Bruyne and Hojlund delivered once more to secure all three points for Napoli.",
      "A cleverly executed short corner presented De Bruyne with space to whip in a dangerous delivery and Hojlund managed to reach the ball ahead of the goalkeeper, directing his header into the unguarded goal. The stellar display from Hojlund earned rave reviews from the Italian press.",
      "The opening sentence of La Gazzetta dello Sport's match coverage declared: \"From Manchester with love.\" The publication highlights that, despite representing rival teams earlier this campaign, the duo have rapidly developed an understanding on the field.",
      "De Bruyne is hailed as the \"brains\" of Conte's squad while Hojlund serves as the \"arm\" tasked with propelling the club to their first European win of the campaign. The display has rekindled belief in the defending Serie A titleholders, who endured a 2-1 setback against AC Milan last weekend.",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport revelled in witnessing De Bruyne as he \"skipped past an opponent\" before teeing up Hojlund's opener. Napoli clinched victory at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium, despite some anxious moments as Sporting attempted to snatch a draw.",
      "The match analysis from Corriere della Sera praised De Bruyne's recovery from recent criticism. When the City legend was replaced late in the game, the ground showed their appreciation: \"Maradona gives him a standing ovation\".",
      "Following the club's recent loss to Milan, questions had been raised about De Bruyne's performances. Nevertheless, Corriere della Sera maintained that De Bruyne's display against Sporting demonstrated precisely why Conte was eager to recruit the midfielder.",
      "Conte had previously questioned De Bruyne but the Belgian is reported to have delivered a \"forceful response\". Hojlund's \"hunger for goals\" was equally highlighted.",
      "Such was De Bruyne's quality that his showing alone is claimed to have justified the cost of the ticket in Naples.",
      "Corriere dello Sport likened Hojlund to a \"sniper\" - a stark contrast to the criticism he was receiving from the Old Trafford faithful. However, ex-United star Scott McTominay didn't quite hit the mark, based on the standards he has set during his time in Italy.",
      "\"The only less brilliant player was McTominay, but it must be understood: he's not a robot; he can't play every match at 100%,\" their report added.",

      "His spells in north London and Manchester did not live up to the three top-flight titles he won at Stamford Bridge, and after time with Roma and Fenerbahce he now finds himself in charge of Benfica. His new side traveled to England this week to face Chelsea in the Champions League, losing 1-0.",

      "\"I remember Patrick Vieira said when he was at Inter and he subbed him off at half-time. When he went back to speak to him, Mourinho already had the video ready. He had it ready to dissect. He said, 'Then you just have to eat the humble pie.'\"",
      "Mourinho's career has slightly dwindled since his impressive years in west London, and his spells with both Tottenham and United were relatively lacklustre. Before taking on the Benfica job, he was sacked by Fenerbahce after poor performances.",
      "Lescott thinks that this downfall is primarily due to how Mourinho manages his players. He added: \"I think the mentality of players has changed which he has found difficult. Because you can't be as truthful to this generation. You've got to baby them. I think you've got to play into their needs.",
      "\"At Chelsea, he didn't need to do that for one and he had the power of being so successful that [Roman] Abramovich was going to back him kind of thing. It's hard to fail there but you can.",
      "\"Plenty of managers did at Chelsea. It's hard to manage them and he managed them perfectly so I think that would be the adaptation for him. Tactically I don't think he needs to adapt so I think it's the management style and how you treat players.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has shared a cheeky post after Kevin De Bruyne set him up twice during Napoli's 2-1 triumph over Sporting CP in the Champions League. The 22-year-old striker left Manchester United last month to join Napoli on a season-long loan with an obligation to buy.",
      "The Denmark forward has since made a brilliant start to life at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium and bagged his second and third goals for the Italian side on Wednesday. Hojlund broke the deadlock against Sporting in the 36th minute, latching onto a gorgeous through-ball from former Manchester City star De Bruyne before firing past the keeper.",
      "Following Luis Suarez's penalty equaliser for Sporting, Hojlund struck again as Napoli restored their advantage in the 79th minute. De Bruyne was the provider once more, delivering a perfect cross into the area for Hojlund to attack, and the striker powered a header beyond the goalkeeper to seal his double.",
      "Despite intense late pressure from Sporting, Napoli clung on to secure their maiden Champions League victory of the campaign following their defeat to Manchester City a fortnight earlier. Taking to Instagram after the match, Hojlund shared a tongue-in-cheek message that will resonate with both United and City supporters.",
      "Posting alongside two snaps of himself celebrating his brace, Hojlund wrote: \"'Højlund scores twice in the Champions League after two assists from Kevin de Bruyne' was not on my 2025 bingo card.\" Hojlund has been on a scoring spree for Napoli, netting three times in five appearances since his transfer from United, with one of those goals coming on his debut against Fiorentina.",
      "Meanwhile, De Bruyne has made an immediate impact at Napoli following his summer move from City. However, there were whispers of discontent after the Belgian appeared frustrated when substituted during the second half of Sunday's match against AC Milan.",
      "When quizzed about this and his performance against Sporting, Napoli manager Antonio Conte said: \"Kevin, compared to the other signings, comes from a different reality. He spent years at City and played at the very highest level.",
      "\"I have nothing to say to him, he's a very good lad and he works hard. I understand his desire to play, but there are also substitutions. I want to win and if I make them, it's with the intention of improving the team.",
      "\"Then it's normal that in the media they are discussed depending on the results – the important thing is that everyone gives their all for the team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United hit a new low on Saturday as they were comfortably beaten 3-1 by Brentford. United boss Ruben Amorim had managed to alleviate some of the intense pressure on him after beating Chelsea a week prior to the defeat to the Bees.",
      "However, Keith Andrews' side ultimately cruised to victory after Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty. Amorim now finds his already precarious position under threat once again.",
      "United currently sit 14th in the Premier League and have won just two games all season. With Amorim's 3-4-3 system under scrutiny, new signing Bryan Mbeumo has lifted the lid on his thoughts on the formation.",
      "Mbeumo was brought in by Amorim this summer from Brentford. Although the French star has looked sharp in a United shirt he endured a tricky return to west London at the weekend.",
      "\"Obviously, we have a lot of things, but it's our responsibility to find the good things and to be better, I think. I don't think there is anything [wrong] about the system, it's just us improving in certain areas.\"",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "Zidane has tantalisingly ended a mini break from social media this week. The former French icon posted a photo on Instagram, posing against the New York City skyline.",
      "While he's clearly enjoying his time off, fans will now be keeping a keen eye on the 53-year-old's next move. The post is the first personal one he has shared for a week and speculation will be rife that he timed the post just as rumours about him taking the United job have surfaced once again.",
      "However, his agent, Alain Migliaccio, had previously claimed that Zidane was not interested in managing in the Premier League. \"I do not think that he will manage in England. It is much less his style. I have discussed it with him,\" he said, adding: \"It does not really attract him.\"",
      "Should Amorim receive his marching orders from United, names such as Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and ex-England boss Gareth Southgate have been touted. However, United have also been credited with an interest in Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola. The Cherries are sixth in the Premier League after just one defeat so far this season and former United goalkeeper Foster believes the Spaniard could have what it takes to change United's fortunes.",
      "\"Iraola is the one for me,\" he said on the Ben Foster – The Cycling GK podcast. \"To lose half your squad, half your starting line-up, and then still be just as impressive, for me, that means you’re a proper coach. But if they’re trying to get Iraola or Glasner then it’s going to cost an awful lot of money.\"",
      "Foster also made a case for ex-Three Lions boss Southgate taking the Old Trafford hot seat. He added: \"I just think with Gareth Southgate, it’s so different to what they’ve ever done and what they’re doing isn’t working.\"",

      "The Danish international was set up by former Manchester City wizard Kevin De Bruyne before coolly slotting home to give his new side a 1-0 lead, threading the ball through Rui Silva's legs.",
      "Sporting clawed their way back into the match when Luis Suarez converted a penalty in the second half, but Hojlund wasn't done yet. De Bruyne once again played the role of provider, whipping a tantalising ball into the box for on-loan United forward Hojlund to head home, sparking more ecstatic celebrations.",

      "After Lamine Yamal won possession high up the field and sparked a swift break, Rashford whipped in a pinpoint cross that teed up Fermin Lopez to fire home into the bottom left corner. It marked his fifth assist in nine appearances for the Spanish heavyweights, having also found the net twice during his stint.",

      "Boss Hansi Flick has been delighted with the winger's settling-in process, recently revealing to Marca: \"Everyone could see it in the last games. In Newcastle [scoring two goals] he gained a lot of confidence. It's not always easy, he came from another league. He is adapting well.\"",
      "Rashford's former United teammate, Rasmus Hojlund, also had a remarkable evening, netting both goals in Napoli's 2-1 home win over Sporting Clube de Portugal. The 22-year-old, also on a season-long loan from United, now has two goals in four games for Napoli.",
      "The Italian giants have an obligation to buy Hojlund at the end of the season.",
      "As for Rashford, Barcelona hold the option to secure the transfer permanently in 2026 for a sum of £30million. However, Barca sporting director Deco has suggested that a verdict over his future remains undecided.",

      "Manchester United are eager to get back on the winning track in the Premier League as they prepare for Sunderland's visit to Old Trafford this Saturday.",
      "Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat to turn things around after a rocky start to the new season, with United only managing two wins out of their six matches, one of which was against Chelsea. However, their spirits were dampened by Brentford, who handed them a 3-1 defeat last time out.",
      "Rumours about Amorim's future have continued to grow, but the Portuguese manager still has the club's support. That said, several managers - including Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner, and Fabian Hurzeler - have been linked with the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Tough decisions and rumours are always part of this job so you have to accept it, you have to deal with it,\" Hurzeler commented this week. \"But I really want to say that I have a lot of respect for Ruben Amorim so I won't talk about his job or any rumours that might come regarding him.",
      "\"I'm really privileged to be a coach for Brighton and Hove Albion, I'm very happy here and we still have a lot of work to do.\"",
      "With all this in mind, Mirror Sport has delved deeper into the latest headlines as speculation over Amorim's future continues to be topic of discussion.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate is not keen on taking the reins at Manchester United, should current manager Amorim be given the boot. It's understood that Southgate isn't in a hurry to get back into football, but he's keeping his options open, both within and outside of the sport.",
      "Back in March 2024, Southgate was touted as a top contender for the United job when Erik ten Hag's position was under threat. However, since stepping down from his role with England, Southgate has steered clear of football, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work.",
      "He's also taken up hosting duties for a show on the BBC. Meanwhile, talkSPORT recently suggested that Southgate was one of three names on United's shortlist to potentially replace Amorim.",
      "The Mirror says: While it's believed that Amorim currently has the backing of United, having a list of potential replacements ready isn't a bad idea if results continue to disappoint. This allows the club to plan ahead and be prepared.",
      "However, contacting other candidates behind the Portuguese manager's back could seriously undermine Amorim during this challenging period for the United boss if they do indeed still back him.",
      "In the midst of the uncertainty surrounding Amorim's future, United are reportedly still eyeing Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, according to TEAMtalk. United attempted to sign Baleba late in the summer transfer window but were unable to strike a deal due to Brighton's steep asking price.",
      "The Seagulls are reportedly demanding a fee similar to the £115million they pocketed for Moises Caicedo in 2023. Despite this, it's believed that United are still keen on pursuing the 21 year old, regardless of whether Amorim remains at the helm.",
      "They could even make an official bid for his services next year. Liverpool are also said to be keeping tabs on the young talent.",
      "The Mirror says: Regardless of whether Amorim stays in charge next season, United should continue their pursuit of Baleba. He represents a long-term investment for the squad. His skill, adaptability, and potential for development make him a player who could shape the team for years to come - and United need more of that.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund scored twice for Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday night.",
      "Hojlund showcased his pace to get in behind Sporting Lisbon's backline for the first goal, and finished brilliantly with a header to win the game for Napoli after a Sporting equaliser.",
      "Speaking after the game, Kevin De Bruyne compared Hojlund to Erling Haaland, which begs the question: why do players improve significantly when they leave Manchester United?",
      "Scott McTominay has been a revelation at Napoli. McTominay opened up on life in Naples during an interview this year, and he's clearly a fan of the food on offer. \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. Bellissimo,\" he said. \"I never ate them at home, they are just red water. Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. It is all so fresh. It’s incredible.\"",
      "Could Hojlund's improvement be down to a diet of freshly picked tomatoes from the hills of southern Italy? Is there a curse at Old Trafford that makes it impossible to perform?",
      "McTominay was named Serie A's player of the year as Napoli won the Scudetto last season. He smoked a cigarette as the team bus paraded and was subsequently nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "Marcus Rashford recently scored twice for Barcelona in their win against Newcastle in the Champions League. His first goal was stunning and he picked up the man of the match award.",
      "Anthony Elanga left United a few years ago, and he's just picked up a Champions League man of the match award for his excellent performance for Newcastle against Union Saint-Gilloise.",
      "Antony has been given his own clothing line by Real Betis and their sporting director has described him as the \"most important signing\" in the Spanish club's history.",
      "The Brazilian re-signed for Betis on transfer deadline day and was mobbed by hundreds of fans at the airport upon his arrival in Seville. Antony was pictured hanging out of a chauffeur-driven car and waving to supporters.",
      "United fans have been left scratching their heads, flummoxed at the success of former players. It has become almost inevitable that an ex-United player will improve when they depart the club.",
      "In April, Amorim was asked about it after Elanga haunted his former club. \"They had the chance here,\" Amorim insisted. \"At Manchester United, you don’t have the time. I will not have the time.",
      "\"We have to get it right fast. You are not talking about players that didn’t play for Manchester United, they were here playing for Manchester United. In here, the pressure is too big sometimes and sometimes you don’t get time and you should have time for these kids to develop.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag frequently discussed the \"pressure\" of representing United. The Dutchman wanted to add personalities who could deal with that pressure when he was appointed from Ajax.",
      "There are perhaps four reasons to explain why United players go on to thrive after leaving the club. And none of them are linked to Italian tomatoes or a curse.",
      "The first point is that United overpay for practically every signing. That is often their fault - the price for Antony rocketed during talks with Ajax and United agreed to their demands - but sometimes it's because the sellers know they are dealing with England's biggest club, a commercial juggernaut.",
      "Selling clubs know United splash the cash each summer and try to get every penny they can. Invariably, this leads to players arriving for huge transfer fees, bringing added scrutiny.",
      "Antony was signed in an £86m deal and Hojlund was signed in a package worth £72m. They were worth half of those fees, and the price tags increased expectation levels.",
      "That does not help new signings perform. The second reason is that the scrutiny at United is unrivalled in Britain. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona are scrutinised more in Europe. United make international headlines after every game and the headlines have mostly not been positive in the last 12 years.",
      "Some players have the skillset to deal with the intense scrutiny, but others crumble under the spotlight, so it's liberating for them to leave Manchester and escape for a fresh start.",
      "A third possible reason - but one that does not apply to players who leave for fellow Premier League clubs - is that players sometimes leave United to play in weaker leagues. Napoli and Barcelona compete in the Champions League, of course, but they face weaker sides in their respective divisions, which makes it easier for former United players to rack up better numbers.",
      "The final point is that, despite a few domestic trophy wins, United have been a mess across the last decade. The club has often been in crisis, so the players who leave walk into more organised teams.",
      "The combination of not having to deal with such a huge price tag, dealing with less pressure, playing in a weaker league and operating in a more organised team is the perfect recipe for improvement.",
      "It's probably more fun to suggest there is a curse at Old Trafford, though.",

      "In ordinary circumstances, a first goal for a Manchester United striker – particularly one costing an eye-watering £74million - would have been major news.",
      "Unfortunately for Benjamin Sesko, these are extraordinary circumstances at United and, as such, his first goal for his new club went largely under the radar.",
      "That is because it came in a depressingly familiar 3-1 defeat at Brentford last weekend, a loss which compounded United's worst-ever start to a Premier League campaign.",
      "Considering this in the 34th season since the English First Division was rebranded and relaunched, that is some going from Ruben Amorim's side, who have a paltry seven points from a possible 18.",
      "Of the many problems that plagued United last season, scoring goals was the biggest they faced, with just 44 in the league. Only Everton and the three relegated teams scored fewer than United, a damning statistic which underlines just how meek they were in front of goal.",
      "Sesko, signed from RB Leipzig, was supposed to address that paucity of goals. With 21 goals to his name last season, his ability to score goals was there, even if it did seem United – who paid £72m for Rasmus Hojlund – had once again paid over the odds for a young striker unproven at the very highest level.",
      "Despite that, United boss Amorim hailed the 6ft 4in 22-year-old Slovenia international as having the perfect profile to lead his side's attack. \"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" said Amorim at the start of the season.",
      "\"He's really young, he's good in the air, he's good at running the channels and he's good on the ball, so I think he has great potential.”",
      "Understandably, Amorim chose to ease Sesko in gently, the forward making his debut as a sub in United's 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal. Sesko came off the bench again a week later in the 1-1 draw at Fulham, where he did little of note.",
      "Sesko got his first start in United's EFL Cup defeat at League Two Grimsby, was back on the bench for the 3-2 win over Burnley and started the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, where Amorim admitted he was “on his own” too often and ultimately a peripheral figure.",
      "In the 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford it was a different story, Sesko's early headed flick-on for Bryan Mbeumo yielding the foul that saw goalkeeper Robert Sanchez shown a red card for taking out the former Brentford attacker.",
      "Ultimately, though, Sesko was substituted at the break, an enforced tactical change made necessary by Casemiro's red card, a setback for the new signing given how lively he looked against Enzo Maresca's side.",
      "Sesko was back in the starting line-up at Brentford and swept the ball into the net at the third time of asking to make it 2-1, but United were unable to find a way back into the game and lost once again.",
      "So how does Amorim get the best out of Sesko? With Saturday's visit of Sunderland potentially shaping up to be a make-or-break game for Amorim, he will need his big-money striker to deliver for him.",
      "Sesko likes to play on the last line of defences and make darting runs in behind them, something United have failed to exploit in his first few appearances and must improve on. His height also makes him a major aerial threat, again a strength United must ensure they play to.",
      "The Brentford defeat was the first game in which Sesko, Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have started together, so their understanding will take time to develop. Time, though, is not something on Amorim's side.",
      "Saturday is the ideal time for Sesko to show just why United paid such a huge fee for him.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "How do you solve a problem like Bruno Fernandes? If you're Ruben Amorim, you continue to play him in midfield and bury your head in the sand.",
      "The notion of Fernandes - captain and unquestionably Manchester United's most accomplished and inspirational player - being a problem is, on the face of it, an absurd notion.",
      "Last season Fernandes saved United from the ignominy of a relegation battle, eight goals and 11 assists in the Premier League making him the stand-out player in Amorim's woeful squad.",
      "This season, albeit only six games into the league campaign, Fernandes has two goals – one from the penalty spot – and no assists, worrying stats for a player who thrives on being central to everything United do in a creative and attacking sense.",
      "Fernandes, a player blessed with formidable attacking prowess, is seeing his creative instincts and influence blunted by Amorim's insistence on playing him in a deeper midfield role, rather than his customary more advanced position, where he can be a bigger threat.",
      "As a result, Fernandes - normally reliable on penalties but who has missed two of his last three spot-kicks - looks disillusioned and disenchanted with his current predicament, shoe-horned into a role that straitjackets his natural exuberance on the ball and deprives United of getting the best out of one of the finest playmakers in world football.",
      "The frustration Fernandes is clearly feeling surfaced in a reckless challenge in United's 3-1 defeat at Brentford last Saturday, a challenge that could quite easily have yielded a straight red card for serious foul play.",
      "Fernandes caught Brentford's Dango Ouattara with a high boot, leaving him sprawling on the ground in agony, the United skipper surviving a VAR check for a possible red card and escaping with a yellow.",
      "But the tackle was a measure of the exasperation Fernandes is experiencing, being asked to fulfil a role by Amorim to which he is not accustomed, something many of United's players will sympathise with, given their misgivings about their manager's system and tactical approach.",
      "The problem for Fernandes in particular is that Amorim has insisted he will continue to play him in the deeper midfield role, to allow him to accommodate new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the two No.10 slots behind fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Yet the current personnel, operating in the 3-4-2-1 system from which Amorim refuses to shift, is simply not working, which in turn has had the effect of the embattled United coach further digging in his heels and doubling down on his way of playing.",
      "Fernandes could have left in the summer, with a £100million offer on the table from Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal, but both he and United rejected it.",
      "As he continues to toil in Amorim's system, it's up to the United boss to prove Fernandes was right to stay at United.",

      "Several coaches have been linked with replacing the Portuguese, should a decision be made. Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner, Fabian Hurzeler, Zinedine Zidane and Xavi Hernandez have all been mentioned as potential successors this week.",

They have the attributes in their squad to play in that system. For me, that's why I'd be concerned about Glasner going to Man United. He's a three-at-the-back man and it is being proven that it is a system that just doesn't fit the players at Man United.",

      "Former Manchester City midfielder De Bruyne assisted Hojlund for both goals. After the game, De Bruyne spoke to UEFA and said: \"Rasmus has a lot of quality and as a striker when you go forward you need that smell of goals - it's really important for him and the team.",
      "\"It's a great night for him and it's going to help us get more goals with him.\"",

      "The midfielder was asked how Haaland and Hojlund are similar, and said: “I think they are very similar because they both like to attack the depth. Maybe Hojlund comes to play the ball towards us more, but I think he needs to attack the space a lot because he can score and give us a big hand.”",

For the time being, the manager remains in place but concerns linger as to what the future could hold should United lose to Sunderland at the weekend.",

      "Hansi Flick has admitted that Marcus Rashford was one of three Barcelona players that suffered with tiredness during their 2-1 defeat against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.",
      "Rashford, 27, continued his excellent recent form with another assist in Barcelona colours on Wednesday, setting up Ferran Torres to open the scoring at Estadi Olimpic Lluis Companys. The England international delivered a precise pass across the box for ex-Manchester City forward Torres to prod home from close-range.",
      "However, Barcelona ended up surrendering the lead as PSG equalised before half-time with Senny Mayulu pouncing on a mistake to make it 1-1. Despite controlling most of the second period, Barca conceded late on to lose with Goncalo Ramos capitalising on a high defensive line to slide home Achraf Hakimi's low cross.",
      "Speaking post-match, Flick claimed that Rashford was one of the players who saw the physical demands of the game take its toll. \"I think you could see in the second half that some players were very tired. Marcus, Pedri, [Frenkie] De Jong,\" he told Diario AS.",
      "\"They gave their all on the pitch. At 1-1, you have to defend better. You have to learn and improve against teams of this quality.\"",
      "Rashford started and played until the 72nd minute before he was substituted for Robert Lewandowski. His assist was his seventh direct goal contribution in his last six appearances for Barca, after scoring twice against Newcastle United last month and setting up one goal in the other five matches.",
      "Rio Ferdinand, meanwhile, reacted to Rashford's performance against PSG and he was impressed with what he saw. \"#Rashford looks reborn at @FCBarcelona [chart increasing emoji and collision emoji].\"",
      "However, Tim Sherwood was not as enthralled with Rashford's showing in the Champions League. Indeed, the ex-Tottenham and Aston Villa manager branded him as \"bang average\" when comparing him to Lamine Yamal.",
      "\"When it goes out to the left to Marcus, he is one dimensional, we know what Marcus is and he's very effective when he does it. He knocks it, he runs past people and when he doesn't the crowd think, 'why don't you give us the same as the genius on the other side?'",

      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faces a must-win game at home to Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "After Saturday's abject 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which left United in 14th place with just seven points from 18, Amorim's position as head coach is under serious threat.",
      "United insist Amorim retains the full backing of those in charge and have rejected suggestions they are already looking at potential candidates to replace him.",
      "Despite that apparent support, Amorim knows he must deliver a convincing win at Old Trafford to ease the pressure on him before heading into the international break.",
      "Here are five issues Amorim must address to give himself the best possible chance of securing a win on Saturday and quieten the calls for him to be replaced.",
      "Amorim kept faith with Altay Bayindir for the Brentford defeat, rather than give a debut to deadline day signing Senne Lammens.",
      "For the most part, Bayindir did well and was arguably United's best player. There was little he could do to prevent Brentford's first goal and he then produced two fine saves, before his defence left him exposed again and United conceded a second. What will have concerned Amorim is the way Bayindir was beaten so easily for Brentford's third goal in added time, seemingly diving out of the way of Mathias Jensen's shot, which was neither high nor found one of the corners of the net.",
      "Against that backdrop, the time has come to give Lammens his chance and start him on Saturday. Bayindir has not done enough to warrant keeping his place and Lammens - despite being an unknown quantity to most and so something of a gamble - deserves the opportunity to showcase the talent that saw United pay £18.2million for him.",
      "United's defensive frailties were once again exposed in the defeat at Brentford, with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw – both of whom were excellent in the hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier – the main culprits. Both were hauled off well before the end – Maguire with 24 minutes left to go – and can have no complaints if they find themselves starting on the bench on Saturday.",
      "Amorim's go-to back three this season has been Shaw, De Ligt and Leny Yoro. The latter was benched last Saturday, after a poor performance in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, but has to start against the Black Cats.",
      "Given Shaw's poor displays against City and Brentford, Amorim should give a chance to Ayden Heaven on the left side of United's three-man central defence, with De Ligt in the middle. In the wing-back roles, Amad missed the Brentford defeat following a family bereavement, but could return on the right side, with Patrick Dorgu set to continue on the left.",
      "Whatever personnel he chooses, Amorim must bring some solidity and confidence to his weak and hesitant backline.",
      "One of the most peculiar aspects of Amorim's first full season in charge has been his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo from the start in any of United's six Premier League games.",
      "Despite repeatedly stating how much he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, Amorim has not felt sufficiently confident to start him in the league, insisting he is fighting with skipper Bruno Fernandes for a starting place, a battle the England midfielder has no chance of winning, given United's talisman is seemingly undroppable.",
      "When Mainoo came on for Manuel Ugarte at Brentford with 24 minutes left on the clock, he brought more mobility, greater urgency and more attacking guile to United's midfield. Unfortunately for Mainoo, his heavy touch in added time ultimately opened the door for Brentford to launch a counter-attack that saw them plunder a third goal to kill the game.",
      "But Mainoo deserves the chance to start on Saturday and showcase his attacking prowess from midfield, with United needing to start on the front foot and take the game to Sunderland, although Amorim is likely to start with Casemiro – back from suspension – and Fernandes in the midfield.",
      "As Amorim himself so memorably stated, not even the Pope could make him switch from the 3-4-2-1 system to which he is so wedded. Having such conviction in a system and way of playing can be seen as a strength, but the inability to adapt when it is clearly not working, as evidenced by results this season, is ultimately a weakness.",
      "If Amorim were to switch to a 4-2-3-1 system, it would surely bring out the best in the players he has and bring out the best in him. The defenders would be more settled in familiar roles they have played for the majority of their careers, while the change would allow him to play Casemiro and Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as a No.10, where he is best deployed to help create and score goals, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo either side of their skipper, and fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko leading the attack.",
      "It won't happen, of course, given Amorim's refusal to change his system, but if that is the hill the United head coach is willing to die on, we may see the last rites given to him and his 11-month tenure this weekend.",
      "After United's derby defeat at local rivals Manchester City, Amorim admitted his £74m summer signing was too isolated throughout the game and the team needed to play closer to him in order for him to play to his strengths.",
      "It was a similar story against Brentford, even though Sesko claimed his first United goal, scoring at the third attempt after his first two efforts were saved. What Amorim and his players must do on Saturday is improve the service to Sesko, who has been starved of it so far, a fact reflected by the fact he has a solitary goal from six Premier League appearances, albeit only three of them starts.",
      "Sesko registered 21 goals for RB Leipzig last season, so has shown he can score consistently at the highest level, but has yet to develop the understanding with his new teammates to allow him to find the net freely.",
      "One feature of Sesko's first half a dozen outings for United has been his willingness to make darting runs off the ball, yet these have not been picked out by his teammates, which is something Amorim and his staff must work on ahead of the Sunderland game.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been branded as \"bang average\" by former Tottenham and Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood despite grabbing another assist in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "Rashford, 27, signed for Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United in the summer, after Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't in his plans. The Catalan side hold the option to purchase Rashford in a permanent transfer worth £30million in 2026.",
      "After a slow start to life at Barcelona, Rashford has hit some form since the turn of the September international break. Indeed, he has registered either a goal or an assist in each of his last six matches for Barca.",
      "The England forward scored his first and second goal for Barca against Newcastle United in the Champions League last month, while he has provided one assist in five of his last six appearances in all competitions.",
      "On Wednesday, Rashford crossed for Ferran Torres to score the opener against Paris Saint-Germain in Europe's elite club competition. However, despite Rashford's latest goal contribution, Sherwood compared him to teammate and Spain sensation Lamine Yamal.",
      "\"When it goes out to the left to Marcus, he is one dimensional, we know what Marcus is and he's very effective when he does it. He knocks it, he runs past people and when he doesn't the crowd think, 'why don't you give us the same as the genius on the other side?'",
      "\"It's harsh on him (Rashford) I know, but it's a very difficult environment for him to play in. Marcus Rashford will develop if he wants to and get better playing in this Barcelona side. He has to get better.\"",
      "Sherwood quipped: \"At the moment, he looks bang average because the kid on the other side is so good.\"",
      "Hansi Flick has been pleased with Rashford's adaptation to Barcelona, telling Marca: \"Everyone could see it in the last games. In Newcastle [scoring two goals] he gained a lot of confidence.",
      "\"It's not always easy, he came from another league. He is adapting well.\"",
      "Barca ended up losing 2-1 to PSG with Senny Mayulu and Goncalo Ramos scoring either side of half-time to complete the comeback for the Champions League holders. Next up for Barca and Rashford is a trip to Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is one of several strikers who have struggled since changing clubs during the summer transfer window.",
      "Sesko scored his first goal for United last time out away against Brentford in his seventh appearance after arriving. The Slovenian international's integration was initially slow, entering half of their Premier League matches midway through as a substitute.",
      "However, he is now starting regularly and completed a full 90 minutes in the league for the first time last weekend. The more Sesko plays, though, the clearer it becomes that United are not playing to the strengths of their £73.7million signing so far.",
      "Paul Merson acknowledged as much on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast. \"He's gone out and bought the lad Sesko; he's never going to score a goal because there's no one going to cross the ball in,\" the player-turned-pundit said.",
      "\"He has two players behind now in [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, they're off the cuff. They're going to get the ball, and they might beat three players and score, or they'll beat three players and put it wide.",
      "\"You're never gonna get someone out wide and put the ball in the box. I feel sorry for the centre forward.\"",
      "Paul Scholes also agreed. \"It's a great point about the centre-forward,\" he said. \"You think, he's six-foot-five, that centre-forward.",
      "\"I was with Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] Friday night, and he said, historically, you think about wide players, people who get you off your seat, crossing the ball. They've signed a six-foot-five centre-forward.",
      "\"We had fullbacks who could cross the ball; Gary Neville could cross a ball, and Denis Irwin could. How do United score goals?",
      "\"You look at a team sometimes, you think, [Erling] Haaland [at Manchester] City, he runs through, brilliant finisher. I can't tell you how Man United score a goal, everything's off the cuff.\"",
      "Liverpool are also encountering a comparable problem with Alexander Isak. The striker had just four touches in half an hour as a substitute during their 1-0 loss to Galatasaray in the Champions League.",
      "As one Liverpool fan explained on social media in response to a post sharing that statistic: \"We don't play the same way Newcastle did. Don't get as much space as Newcastle.",
      "\"They have wingers who put decent balls into the box. Our wingers cut back, allowing the defenders to get set behind the ball. Too slow. We also don't attack the byline and pull it back.\"",
      "Another of their supporters said, \"He came from a team that pumped the ball upfield quickly. They played him in over the top, and they pumped it up to wingers down the channels, who whipped it in for him. We just hold the ball for ages and have a slow, ponderous build-up. That's not Isak's game.\"",
      "Those assessments could easily apply to United and Sesko. The same issues are afflicting both clubs since the start of this season.",

      "The winger missed United's 3-1 defeat at Brentford due to a family bereavement, but returned to full training with the rest of the squad and is available for Saturday's visit of Sunderland.",
      "Amad, who has mainly been deployed as a right wing-back by Amorim, had started five of United's six games this season, but was allowed compassionate leave last week, which meant he missed Saturday's trip to west London.",
      "Explaining the situation ahead of United's trip to Brentford, Amorim said: “Someone in his family passed away, so we are giving all the support to Amad. We understood it was important to him to have his time and we are here for him.”",
      "News of Amad's family bereavement came after he was criticised on social media by some fans for posting a picture of him and former United winger Alejandro Garnacho swapping shirts after the Chelsea game.",
      "Garnacho made an acrimonious exit from United in the summer, joining Chelsea in a £40million deal, and was subjected to sustained abuse by home fans on his return to Old Trafford.",
      "Following the backlash from fans over the pictures he posted of him and Garnacho, Amad deleted all the posts from his Instagram and X accounts.",
      "Asked about the incident, Amorim said: \"I say the same thing to my players - shut down social media. It's like that nowadays. It's a price you have to pay. The important thing is the club and his friends are real life for Amad. We are here for him. \"",
      "The 23-year-old Ivory Coast international is likely to return to the starting line-up against Sunderland in place of Diogo Dalot, who struggled on his return from injury in the loss at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Also part of the main training group again was Tyrell Malacia, who looked to be heading out of United in the summer, but was unable to secure a move to another club.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui is still sidelined through injury and will not be available until after the October international break, which begins next week.",
      "As well as Amad, Amorim has Casemiro available again, after he served a one-game suspension following a red card in United's 2-1 win over Chelsea.",

      "The incident saw the Republic of Ireland international penalised in the penalty area for a foul on Bryan Mbeumo, however, it has become clear that the stopper denied a goal scoring opportunity. Bruno Fernandes did go on to miss the resulting penalty while the Bees went on to rubber-stamp their triumph as Mathias Jensen added the third in stoppage time.",
      "In the wake of the defeat, the decision from Craig Pawson not to reduce the hosts to 10 men has been criticsed with Premier League icon Alan Shearer doubling down on his criticism.",
      "\"He should have been [sent off], but I think in the first instance the penalty wasn't given on field, there was a slight delay,\" Foy told talkSPORT.",
      "\"I think the assistant referee on that side, Lee Betts, has spoken to the referee, he's communicated that, Craig Pawson points to the spot and the next thing, the penalty is given, that's the decision we want.",
      "\"But there is more to it isn't there? Quite clearly, what we're talking about is, is it a goalscoring opportunity? And should Andy Madley recommend a review? Yes he should, that was a clear red card offence in my opinion.",
      "\"Take the defender away, look where Mbeumo is, look where the ball is, in my opinion, the VAR should've recommended a review and I'm sure if Craig Pawson would've looked at the monitor then a red card would've been shown.\"",

      "\"They deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball, I mean honestly, it's just a terrible decision.",
      "\"He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",
      "\"Yes, [Fernandes] had to wait four-and-a-half minutes before getting to that decision but that's a mistake from him. [Collins] should have been sent off - absolutely no doubt about it.\"",

      "Joshua Zirkzee appears to have emerged as a potential target for Cesc Fabregas's Como ahead of the January transfer window. The 24-year-old striker, who Manchester United signed from Bologna for £36.5m last year, has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout, Zirkzee has struggled to force himself into the starting lineup. So far this season, the Netherlands international has featured just three times in the Premier League, making one start.",
      "Despite having only played 82 minutes across all competitions, Zirkzee has reportedly attracted interest from the Serie A. According to Italian outlet Corriere Como, Como are interested in signing the Dutchman as they push to qualify for the Champions League with claims of an 'agreement' already having been struck.",
      "Fabregas' side, who finished 10th last term, are currently eighth after just five games, with only four points separating them from AC Milan at the top of the table. The report claims that the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder is preparing to 'reshape' his team in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "It's said that the club want to combine experience with 'young but ready players', and Zirkzee fits the profile. Como have a 'concrete interest' in the United forward, whose contract at Old Trafford runs until June 2029 and has also been linked with Juventus.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "At the start of the year, Amorim expressed his intentions to keep Zirkzee at the club. Speaking to talkSPORT, the Reds boss said: \"I want to keep Josh because he gives everything and he’s trying in training but we don’t know.",
      "\"The window is open and we will see what happens. We just need to focus on training and to take this for the other games. It’s just one point so let’s focus on the performance for the next games.\"",
      "Then, in April, Amorim heaped praise on the Dutchman. He told reporters: \"Yes, he's doing a great job. Also a very important thing was the way the fans react after that incident.",
      "\"So if you see, every time, even if Josh is not playing, every time he gets on the pitch or just warming up, our fans sing the Josh song. So that is massive for the player, so it's 50-50. Fifty per cent part of the fans and 50 per cent of Josh.\"",
      "On helping Zirkzee find his feet, Amorim added: \"I explained the situation because, as a former player, I wanted to hear some explanation sometimes from the coaches and I am really open that.",
      "\"I just want to help the team and then work with him. With all the work that all the staff is doing with him he's improving, and then I put him to play. This is the only way to show confidence to the player.\"",

      "United returned from the September international break to lose against Manchester City, but the players responded by securing a spirited victory against Chelsea the following weekend.",
      "Amorim hoped to win back-to-back league games for the first time since arriving at Old Trafford against Brentford. The bookmakers made United the favourites to claim three points at the Gtech Community Stadium, however, the Bees had a two-goal advantage within 20 minutes and wrapped up the victory with a 3-1 win.",
      "The inquest has begun and Amorim's future is dominating headlines again. United's head coach has won 34 points from a possible 99 in the top-flight since his appointment in November.",
      "In an interview with The National, Yorke was asked about United's awful start to the campaign and said: “[Amorim] has been there nearly a year, you expect things to kind of progress slowly. But it seems like we are making one step forward and two step backwards. There is no consistency there.",
      "\"And I think it's kind of left us all scratching our heads at the moment. Where we are as a football club is not where we expected it to be. It's a very difficult stage for us. We thought after the Sir Alex [Ferguson] era we will go through a phase but did not expect it to be this long.”",
      "Yorke continued: “The players that they brought in are certainly better players than what we already had. So that's always likely to improve the team, but we haven't seen that.",
      "“We expect the start to be a little bit better and now we, again, seem to go back to where we sort of finished last season when we thought we would be progressing this year. And that's a bit of a concern.",
      "“I think at the moment we are fighting for consistency, seeing a pattern of play or something that we can relate to. We're not encouraged, we might be encouraged one week. We make one step forward and two steps backwards.",
      "“The inconsistency is not knowing what to expect. You don't really know how to identify what United are, or you don't know what United is likely to turn up. And I think that's a frustrating part.",
      "\"If people see something a little bit more consistent and see a certain style of play, you can kind of relate to that. But at the minute we just don’t know what's going on. And it's a difficult watch.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes' penalty in the 75th minute against Brentford was saved. Yorke said of the skipper: “A captain is more than just the playing side of it. He's the one that leads the team, he's a talisman.",
      "\"He's the one that everyone looks to rally around the team and if you find your captain is struggling, this season in particular… He has been outstanding, I think, over the last three years or so where he stood up to everything and really brought the team along and kept us where we are.",

      "Ruben Amorim received a comforting tap on the back from a Manchester United staff member in the bowels of the Gtech Community Stadium after finishing his press conference.",
      "Amorim spoke for six minutes and 12 seconds during his post-match address to the media. And it's starting to feel like United's head coach is on borrowed time in Manchester.",
      "Amorim praised United's aggression against Chelsea, but that was absent against Brentford, who did not look like the team that had suffered a bad defeat the previous weekend.",
      "The warning signs were there from the first whistle. Brentford found pockets of space to exploit and Amorim did not look pleased, pacing up and down the touchline with his water bottle.",
      "Nathan Collins should have received a red card for bringing Bryan Mbeumo to the ground, but Bruno Fernandes did not convert the penalty. That decision went against United, but they were not good enough.",
      "Amorim chugged water and dropped his bottle to the floor when Mathias Jensen scored Brentford's third goal. He looked like a manager on the brink, although United sources have insisted he retains the backing of the board and no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Speaking before Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's normal the fans don't know what is going to happen in the next game. To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager.\"",
      "Amorim was not joking when he said he doesn't know which version will turn up, but that is the reason many fans are starting to believe he is not the manager to take United forward.",
      "It's worrying that Amorim still needs to micromanage his players during matches, despite being in charge for 11 months. His behaviour on the touchline hasn't changed from his first game against Ipswich Town.",
      "Every football manager gives instructions from the touchline during matches, but the extent to which Amorim must gesture for players to get into the areas he wants is a red flag.",
      "There have been concerns with the system from the moment Amorim was appointed. Some loyal season ticket holders questioned why a coach who plays a formation that does not align with United's traditional philosophy had been appointed, while others suggested it was time for meaningful change.",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has joked that even the Pope could not make him change his approach. That stubbornness may prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlook for the weeks ahead looked significantly better after a spirited Chelsea victory, but Amorim was unable to win back-to-back league games for the first time. United continue to take one step forward and two steps back, which has made progress impossible.",
      "The underlying data suggest United have improved this season, but a spreadsheet will not save Amorim from the chopping block - securing wins and moving up the league table will.",
      "The three games sandwiched between the September and October international breaks felt huge for Amorim, although it's illogical to decide his future on a game-by-game basis.",
      "What would change if United win against Sunderland before the October break? It feels like a victory would only delay the inevitable, but it's not a surprise that Ineos are dithering.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment. It reflects badly on United's chiefs if they decide to sack Amorim.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window and Amorim has no excuses not to make it work. However, a roaring success story is now required for him to turn it around.",
      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Amorim on the final day of last season, and a banner with those words has recently been unfurled in the Stretford End to show support for him.",
      "It will be interesting to see whether that banner is raised against Sunderland this weekend.",

      "Lukaku made the move to Old Trafford in 2017 after United beat Chelsea to his signature from Everton, in a deal worth a reported £75million. He has since gone on to play for Inter Milan and AS Roma, with a spell back at Stamford Bridge - where he made 44 appearances, scoring 15 times.",

      "Manchester United are not currently lining up a replacement for Ruben Amorim, but should Ineos decide to pull the trigger and sack the Portuguese, Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner will be one of the frontrunners to come in.",
      "Speculation about Amorim's future at Old Trafford has intensified in recent weeks following several disappointing defeats. The Manchester derby defeat two weeks ago was then compounded by another loss at Brentford on Saturday.",
      "On Sunday, it was reported that Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Gareth Southgate were all on their radar. Zinedine Zidane, Fabian Hurzeler and Xavi have all also been mentioned in the following hours.",
      "Glasner is a man in high demand at the moment after his record at Crystal Palace. He guided the Eagles to the FA Cup last season and has started this term in fine form. However, the Austrian is in the final 12 months of his contract, and that has resulted in him being linked with every vacant job.",
      "Recently, he was asked about the rumours linking him with the job at Old Trafford and other 'top clubs' by the Austrian edition of Kicker, and he refused to give much away. \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is - neutrally and completely relaxed,\" he said.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Glasner has been named as the favourite to replace Amorim by many in the fanbase due to his immense success at Palace. He has also deployed a 3-4-2-1 style of play that has reaped the benefits - something United and Amorim have failed to do.",
      "What could be even better for United is what pull he could have in their transfer plans. It's well-known that a new midfielder is one of the priority areas when the window reopens, and Adam Wharton is among the players linked.",
      "Previously, it was understood that Palace valued Wharton at £60million. CIES Football Observatory reckon the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Using a sample of over past 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable. Alongside United target Carlos Baleba, Wharton offers defensive security and energy, something that Amorim's current crop has failed to do. The England international has developed into one of the best midfielders in the Premier League, and his arrival is exactly what United should have gone for in the summer. The signings of both Glasner and Wharton may well be the perfect welcoming gift for the new era. Amorim and United, though, will be hoping it doesn't come to that just yet. When the January transfer window opens, United are expected to be in the market for a central midfielder, with or without Amorim. Wharton is one of the most-suitable options with the England international consistently showing his ability for Palace.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings, would make the team stronger from the get-go. United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for Amorim to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it, in the face of such overwhelming evidence.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "But two defeats in four days to Crystal Palace in the Premier League and Galatasaray in the Champions League have turned the mood slightly with previous poor displays now becoming an issue for some.",
      "Their midfield and defence have come under scrutiny with the performances of Konate one concern amongst a lot of supporters and pundits.",
      "Liverpool are one injury away from disaster with Giovanni Leoni potentially out for the full season and the Reds failing to get a deal for Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi over the line on deadline day.",
      "With Guehi’s contract up at the end of the season, Liverpool could face increased competition for his signature in the January transfer window and Everton’s Branthwaite – who has been the subject of bids from Man Utd in the past – is now an option.",
      "READ: Liverpool rue Salah contract as ‘ageing’ Van Dijk fails to handle ‘complete sh*t’",
      "Former Man Utd and Tottenham scout Mick Brown told Football Insider: “Branthwaite will certainly be on the radar at Liverpool.",
      "“I’d be very surprised if he was to move in January, Everton won’t want to let him go and he’s had this injury which he needs to recover from.",
      "“Clubs like Liverpool will be keeping an eye on that I’m sure, seeing how well he recovers and if he gets back to his best quickly because it’s another long layoff for him.",
      "“Plus, he’s a left-sided centre-back, and that’s the position Van Dijk plays in at the moment so bringing him in would do little to solve their problems.",
      "“But like I say, that interest will be there as a long-term option, and maybe he could come in and develop his game a bit more by learning from Van Dijk.",
      "“I just don’t see him as a replacement for Konate, and it would be a shock to see him leave Everton now.",
      "“I expect they’ll keep an eye on how he progresses over the rest of the season and then if they think there’s a position for him, that might be when they make a move.”",

      "Spanish website Defensa Central insists that ‘the media and agent world is practically 99% sure that Konaté will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons’.",
      "Despite not playing well this season, Real Madrid ‘has a lot of faith in his potential’ with Konate able to solve their ‘weakness’ at set-pieces and crosses.",
      "Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol slammed Konate’s performance in their 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last weekend with the France international “unbelievably horrendous” in the first half.",
      "Nicol said on ESPN: “It would be really harsh to pull one person out, but I think the man that was at the start of it was Konate. He had an absolutely, unbelievably horrendous first half.",
      "“He couldn’t pass the ball properly, he kept giving fouls away, he got booked, he’s trying to fight Mateta. I know Konate’s a big lad but Mateta’s bigger than him and you’ve got to use your brains.",
      "“Unfortunately today Konate didn’t use any brains whatsoever. So, he kicked it off and it almost kind of spread like a disease after that. Everybody giving the ball away.",
      "“And when you give a ball away against Crystal Palace, it is really the thing they do best. They exploit mistakes from the opposition and then they get at you quickly going forward.",
      "“Only some poor finishing, particularly from Mateta, is the reason that Liverpool were still in this game at all.. The truth of the matter is that all of the things Liverpool didn’t do well today are the same things they haven’t done well all season… Liverpool’s backline just doesn’t look composed at all.",
      "“Yes, you would hope the midfield can stop the opposition getting at the backline as often as it does. But at the end of the day the backline is there to do the job and right now it doesn’t look comfortable anytime it is asked to defend – whether it is today or the previous games.",
      "“Liverpool might be sitting top of the league still but Arne Slot still has a lot of questions that need answering that he hasn’t quite found the answer to yet.”",

      "It has been claimed that Liverpool would be “prepared to let” one key player “leave” the Premier League giants at some point in 2026.",
      "Liverpool could reportedly be on the brink of losing two players as Real Madrid have ‘secured two signings’ as Xabi Alonso has given his ‘approval’.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool are already ‘on the verge’ of ‘completing’ a ‘controversial’ transfer as they battle Manchester United for a signing.",

      "Regular readers of these hallowed pages will know that our push for Premier League managerial sackings is generally limited to five, maybe six, reasons why they should be shown the door.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And still – at time of writing – Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. So we’ve come up with 20.",
      "",
      "We would be completely bored of it by now if we didn’t actually quite look forward to witnessing the level of exasperation shown by Amorim when asked by a reporter in each and every press conference or post-defeat interview whether he might consider changing his formation.",
      "He maintains, almost entirely on the basis of success at one other football club, that it’s not the system that’s the problem, and he’s not for moving.",
      "We don’t quite know why we’ve reached a point in professional football where a manager who can’t, or at least won’t, adapt is held up as some sort of misunderstood genius, but Amorim has been given a helluva lot of rope because of his stubbornness.",
      "The ‘it worked at Sporting’ argument very simply falls down on the basis of Manchester United not being Sporting, and we do wonder whether Amorim now regrets his early insistence that he would stick with 3-4-3 no matter what.",
      "While he understandably sees a move away from his principles as a respect-dwindling admission of defeat, surely the very real, actual defeats are far more damaging to his reputation.",
      "",
      "We’re as culpable as anyone for lumping formation and philosophy together. They go hand in hand – we get it. But it’s also possible for a system to not be working for a team while the wider ethos is apparent. That’s not the case here.",
      "Without saying ‘pressing’ or ‘transition’ because literally every f***er with a few magnets on a tactics board would pick those two facets of the game as key to their philosophy, can anyone tell us what Amorim’s core Manchester United principles are? You said ‘overloads’, didn’t you? Get out.",
      "",
      "Only 11 Premier League managers have had a worse record after 33 games. Frank Lampard had the same tally at Everton.",
      "",
      "Like a p*ssed up bloke down the pub going nose to nose with you looking for any excuse for a rumble, he’s f***ing asking for it.",
      "After being talked down from a ledge after a 3-1 defeat to Brighton in January, when he told United bosses he was ‘prepared to resign’, reports continue to suggest Amorim may walk before he’s pushed. And while that sounds very much like a £12m compensation saving, we can see Gary Neville now with his headset on explaining why someone quitting Manchester United before they quit on him is “the lowest of the low for the football club”.",
      "",
      "Erik ten Hag kept his job because Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Sure, it was maybe the only time in the entirely of his second season at Old Trafford when performance and result came together, and it was absolute madness to hand him a new contract on the back of it, but it was a trophy, and one they claimed by beating very much the best team in England at the time in Manchester City.",
      "Amorim didn’t win a trophy and lost to the 17th best team in England, managed by a guy whose only three victories in his last 15 games in all competitions for Tottenham and now Nottingham Forest came in that final and the two semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt.",
      "",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte, and it’s not as though Fernandes himself has been in undroppable form.",
      "Not only are United terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "",
      "It was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and INEOS plumping for him as their manager, and he would probably already be out of the job if it wasn’t for that charm. It makes him a very difficult man to dislike and there’s no doubting his ability to hold the room.",
      "But if anything, he’s honest to a fault, and we can’t imagine Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are too enamoured with him besmirching the great name of Manchester United.",
      "Heralding this as “the worst team in Manchester United history” can’t be good for the share price.",
      "",
      "“How are you supposed to adapt to a situation when you’re changing it constantly?!” a genuinely irritated Micah Richards asked on Match of the Day, accompanied by a graphic showing the scattergun changes Amorim made in an attempt to rescue a point against Brentford, which ended with Mason Mount at left wing-back in one of the more laughable examples of his 3-4-3 obstinacy.",
      "We can just about give him a pass for a bit of substitution chaos to turn a game on its head, but what we can’t fathom is his insistence on changing at least one of his centre-backs in every single game.",
      "He’s made ten unenforced centre-back substitutions this season. Win, lose or draw, it doesn’t matter. Leny Yoro came on for Maguire on Saturday, started on the left side, forcing Matthijs de Ligt into the middle, then moved to the right when Mount came on for Luke Shaw, with Diogo Dalot moving into the back three.",
      "There’s a fair chance they didn’t know where they were supposed to be playing come the end of the game, and there’s no way the players walked off that pitch believing they’re in the hands of a measured tactician.",
      "",
      "Reports suggest sacking Amorim will cost the club £12m. For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position, meaning any new manager would need to make a five-place improvement on whatever Amorim might achieve this season for his sacking to make fiscal sense. Yer da could do that.",
      "",
      "It really is amazing just what a tonic not being at Manchester United is. After finding the net on debut for Napoli, Hojlund scored two goals in the Serie A side’s 2-1 win over Sporting in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "The first saw him burst through two defenders and latch on to a through ball from Kevin De Bruyne before sliding the ball between the goalkeeper’s legs; the second saw him put his head where it hurts to beat the ‘keeper to a De Bruyne cross.",
      "If you wanted a brace to showcase a Proper Striker it was just about perfect and the first goal in particular is the sort of run and finish many Manchester United fans will have been expecting from Hojlund when Amorim arrived at the club. He’s got a not dissimilar profile to Viktor Gyokeres, who banged goals in for fun under Amorim in Portugal.",
      "Instead what they got was a clearly talented striker brought to Manchester United ruined by a manager who – as Benjamin Sesko is now also evidence for – doesn’t know how to get the ball to them.",
      "",
      "In Keith Andrews’ eighth game as a football manager he “out-schooled” Amorim. His tactics weren’t revolutionary – they didn’t need to be.",
      "Brentford recycled passes between their defenders while every now and again playing the ball into midfield to draw United on to them. When the United midfielders stepped out to press, Jordan Henderson or someone else played a long ball up to Igor Thiago, who then had what turned out to be the very simple task of bullying one, two or all three centre-backs to win free-kicks, create chances and score goals with the Red Devils midfield nowhere to be seen.",
      "As Alan Shearer said, Amorim is making life “easy” for Andrews and every other manager he comes up against as they know exactly how United are going to play.",
      "",
      "Glasner is currently the bookies favourite to replace Amorim and would apparently take the job “in a heartbeat”. More fool him.",
      "The Austrian makes a lot of sense, not least because of the wonderful progress he’s made at Palace, first without Michael Olise and now without Eberechi Eze, but also because he’s showing that 3-4-3 can work in the Premier League and his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "Gareth Southgate is second favourite and we can see why he’s Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s pick, but as Jamie Carragher said, “the problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, ‘I could do a better job than that.'”",
      "",
      "Haven’t heard this nonsense in a while, have we? And we wonder whether that’s because the football Amorim has United playing is now so far removed from the fabled Manchester United DNA that the genetics of the football club is no longer even considered as part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Ole back at the wheel, anyone?",
      "",
      "“Something has to change and you cannot change 22 players,” Amorim said after the historic defeat to League Two Grimsby, in another hint at his possible resignation, having claimed “the players spoke really loud” through their performance.",
      "But the players might argue, as we and a raft of other publications and pundits did, that Amorim rocking from side to side on the bench as his team lost the penalty shootout was a pretty deafening declaration of a more overarching defeat. It looked like the point of no return, and still does.",
      "",
      "There’s always a rock under the one at the bottom. And while there’s undoubtedly some recency bias involved, with the latest defeat often declared a new nadir to sell a sack story or just because it’s fun to write and read about last week’s “worst Manchester United team in history” being somehow better than this week’s, there may also be a cumulative effect which automatically makes the most recent defeat the new nadir because of the sustained period of sh*te.",
      "Anyway, there have been plenty. Grimsby, Brentford, a 2-0 home defeat to Graham Potter’s West Ham, Brentford again, Wolves on Boxing Day.",
      "",
      "Amorim is an absolute gift when it comes to presenting us with images of his and Manchester United’s slow death. Aside from smiling pictures in press conferences or while walking into the stadium before the latest crushing blow, there are three stock Amorim photos available for selection: shouty, gesticulating Amorim; crouched down, head-in-hands Amorim; looking down, deep-in-thought Amorim.",
      "We love, love, love that he was asked about that last one after the Brentford defeat, dismissing it as “nothing” and “something I’ve always done”, but we will always choose to side with the body language experts drafted in to give their hot takes.",
      "“You can see him crouched down in a fetal position, almost like what a baby does,” said the Mirror’s crack BLE. “Imagine if someone was about to get beaten up, that’s the first stance they adopt. They go on the ground and put themselves in a fetal position.”",
      "",
      "You’ve got to wonder if, while watching Rashford score a brilliant brace for Barcelona against Newcastle in the Champions League, Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses considered the possibility that they may have backed the wrong horse.",
      "Rashford would very likely still be a Manchester United player if Amorim wasn’t the manager, and is currently performing at a higher level than any of the forwards currently in the Red Devils squad, as he did at Aston Villa last season.",
      "After all of that contrived nonsense in the media about Barcelona sending him back to Old Trafford after a couple of games, he’s now asserted himself as a starter in one of the best teams in Europe, assisting a goal in each of his last four La Liga games and against PSG in the Champions League on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "“I think he’s still in a job, because I think the powers that be on Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far and decisions that they’ve made on and off the pitch that they almost don’t want to admit right now, that they’ve made another,” Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "Sounds about right, but we put it to Ratcliffe and the Manchester United powers that be that by not admitting to the mistake of hiring Amorim they’re currently making another in not sacking him.",
      "There have been a helluva lot of mistakes though… Ruben Amorim is the worst of 19 Sir Jim Ratcliffe mistakes at Manchester United",
      "",
      "It was reported last month that Amorim was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’ as players ‘questioned his refusal to pivot mid-match, with his tactics struggling against the Premier League’s relentless pace’, and we’re not convinced that an Enzo Maresca and Robert Sanchez-inspired victory over Chelsea will have outweighed a Brentford defeat in the dressing room confidence stakes since.",
      "",
      "For Amorim, Ratcliffe, the players, the fans, the cabal of Manchester United pundits, it is really just quite embarrassing just how bad at football they are. And yes, it is also quite embarrassing to spend £200m on new players for a manager only to sack him a couple of months later, but what’s the alternative? Wade through this sh*te until January and spend another wedge of cash on the next raft of ill-advised souls doomed to fail at Old Trafford?",
      "We understand that Amorim isn’t solely to blame – there are at least five other culprits – but there really is currently no-one more to blame for this mess. He has been, and will continue to be, a “disaster”.",
      "Manchester United are ‘more likely’ to get relegated than qualify for Europe, so there should be zero debate over Ruben Amorim’s future…",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner now has his ‘eyes set on’ the Man Utd job as pressure builds on Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "With sacked Nuno Espirito Santo ‘expected’ to replace sacked Graham Potter, we can only assume that Potter will replace Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",
      "According to reports, Gareth Southgate has decided his ‘stance’ on replacing Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "Manchester United are ‘more likely’ to get relegated than qualify for Europe, so there should be zero debate over Ruben Amorim’s future…",
      "United are still failing to break their bleak Groundhog Day cycle, with the fallen Premier League giant back to square one following a dreadful year under Amorim.",
      "The 40-year-old was given a lot of grace in his first few months at Man Utd as he did not receive nearly enough criticism for last season’s dire decline en route to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "There were excuses aplenty and pleas for more time in and out of the club so Amorim could build a squad equipped to thrive in his 3-4-3 formation over a couple of transfer windows, with optimistic (or naive) supporters getting giddy in the summer as the club spent over £200m on new attackers and signed a new goalkeeper.",
      "But folks, it has been Groundhog Day once again as the Red Devils have capitulated at the earliest sign of adversity, with three Premier League losses in six games and the embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town exposing their lack of progress.",
      "READ: The five people most to blame for the Manchester United mess",
      "So far, there has been zero improvement in attacking areas following their £200m overhaul, while United remain just as ineffective in the other positions after overlooking the midfield department and signing another No.2 instead of an upgrade on Andre Onana in the summer.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd are getting no better, as his blank refusal to adapt to save face means he is dying on his sword, and the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked needs to be axed soon if the club are to salvage anything from this season, with this squad of players capable of much more provided there are a few tweaks.",
      "Really, Amorim should have already been and gone, but INEOS will surely have no choice but to get rid if they lose against newly-promoted Sunderland at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Ahead of this game, ‘football statisticians at 247Bet’ have used a supercomputer to make predictions for the remainder of this season and for Man Utd, it makes for grim reading.",
      "According to the data, Man Utd ‘will finish the season on just 45 points’ to ‘progress to 14th place’, with this a three-point improvement on last campaign’s record low.",
      "The system also gave United ‘15% chance of relegation, a 0% chance of securing Champions League or Europa League football’, while they are ‘almost as likely to go down as 16% Sunderland’.",
      "It also says that the Red Devils should finish eight points clear of the bottom three, with Brentford, Wolves and Burnley backed to get relegated. So, there’s that at least…",
      "AI will eventually get to us all, but we at F365 have taken a hard line that supercomputers are bullsh*t and this one is the same.",
      "Still, it’s unforgivable for Man Utd, who lead our five-year net spend table, to even loosely be considered for relegation and be on a par with newly-promoted Sunderland, regardless of how well they have settled back into the Premier League, and it should leave INEOS with no option but to sack Amorim.",

      "The Portuguese head coach has barely over a point per game in the Premier League since moving to Man Utd from Sporting CP last year and the Red Devils will be in and around relegation trouble if they keep up their current form.",
      "After beating Chelsea 12 days ago, Man Utd lost to Brentford 3-1 at the weekend in another example of their inconsistent form and there have been rumours that the Red Devils ‘fear’ he will resign.",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "‘He’s been seen at numerous matches, as well as other sporting events, in recent months, and remains close with a number of his former FA colleagues. However, Southgate is also close friends with Dan Ashworth, who had a long term plan to appoint Southgate when he worked at United.’",

      "For people of a certain generation, Manchester United represents the all-conquering final boss of football.",
      "The ’90s and 2000s were dominated by Sir Alex Ferguson’s team and the idea of them falling away even after the Scot left felt impossible.",
      "And yet, the club’s latest embarrassment at the hands of Brentford, a team that finished third in League One in Ferguson’s final year, was not met with shock but apathy.",
      "More than a decade on since the manager left, Manchester United have transformed from title winners to laughing stock to simply another mediocre team.",
      "But how does one of the world’s biggest football clubs fall off so severely? Here are the five people most to blame for the mess of modern-day Manchester United.",
      "£1.25billion can get you a lot of things in the world. You could buy the most expensive apartment in New York four times over. You could have 17 of the most expensive Ferraris ever made sitting on your drive. You could even own 5 million pairs of Nike running shoes.",
      "Or you could become the very public face of one of the biggest sporting embarrassments on the planet.",
      "While the Glazers keep their distance, the self-confessed United fan (even though he tried to buy Chelsea) Ratcliffe has been a permanent presence at Old Trafford since his partial takeover, meaning after every embarrassing defeat, the camera cuts to him bearing an expression of a man confused as to why this is not as simple as running a pharmaceutical company.",
      "Ratcliffe beat somewhat mysterious opposition from Qatar to become a minority owner of United but in the near 600 days that he has been in charge of football operations, it has been one negative story after another.",
      "If on-field problems are to be expected, it is off-field that Ratcliffe has come in for most criticism. Almost as soon as his feet were under the desk, Ratcliffe and chief executive Omar Berrada set about cutting down the staff size. 250 employees were made redundant in the first round, a further 200 to come, with the club suggesting it will save between £8 and £10m – or around one seventh of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "With a staff size of around 1,100, maybe United did need to trim the fat a little bit but it is the manner in which Ratcliffe has gone about it that has most rubbed people up the wrong way. Since 1985, the club had given £40,000 to a charity set up to help former players who played in an era before the millions. Ratcliffe axed it.",
      "Ruthless yes, but when he sat down with an interview with Gary Neville, the former right-back asked why the club did not arrange a one-off dinner with current players to fund the expense and Ratcliffe, while looking like Neville had just discovered the cure for cancer, said they had not considered that as an idea.",
      "Then there are the on-pitch matters. Erik ten Hag was appointed pre-Ratcliffe but it was the INEOS boss who opted to keep him after an extensive review in the summer only to sack him a few months later.",
      "United paid a not insignificant fee to bring Dan Ashworth to the club, a man who had proven success as sporting director at Newcastle, but Ratcliffe sacked him five months into the job.",
      "Ratcliffe also led the way on the hiring of Ruben Amorim, a coach who looks so out of his depth and one who appears to be pining for the sack and a nice pay-out.",
      "The club have at least repaired their training ground and plans are in place for a revamped Old Trafford but somehow the atmosphere around the club feels worse than it did when the British billionaire first stepped in.",
      "MORE ON UNITED ON F365\n👉 Man Utd flop ‘felt disrespected’ after ’40 days’ in exile after Amorim bomb squad decision\n👉 Man Utd technical team ‘bemused’ by Ratcliffe pick to replace Amorim at Old Trafford\n👉 Roy Keane, Manchester United manager? ‘Ferocious’ Red Devils legend ‘knows the standards’!",
      "In 100 years’ time and if we have not all been replaced by AI-powered cyborgs, Amorim will not even be mentioned in the history of Manchester United.",
      "His tenure, while being the main focus now, seems so fleeting, so inconsequential and so symptomatic of wider problems that it is hard to put too much blame on his shoulders.",
      "In many ways, it feels like Amorim is being blamed for the dining conditions on the Titanic. Yes, he has put the wrong cutlery out for the starters but that all seems rather inconsequential when there is a 12-foot hole in the front of the ship.",
      "Amorim has to be blamed for sticking so rigidly to a way of playing that, without some adaptations, simply cannot work in the highly physical Premier League and against some of the best tactical brains in the world. But Ratcliffe and co. should have known this before they hired him.",
      "Liverpool were the ones first on the lookout for a new manager when Jurgen Klopp retired but after looking at Amorim, their board decided he was too inflexible. Ratcliffe and co. deemed that perfect for a United squad with far worse players.",
      "Ed Woodward is not what some would call a ‘proper football man.’ Before he stepped through the doors at Old Trafford he worked as an investment banker and was working for JP Morgan before making the switch.",
      "Woodward was brought into the United fold during the Glazer takeover, acting as their advisor for the process. He was then added to a “financial planning” role but it was not until 2007 that his influence began to be felt.",
      "To give credit where credit’s due, Woodward was very good in his role of the leader of commercial operations at United. The lucrative deals he brought to the club (why wouldn’t United need an official agricultural vehicle partner?) created the platform that allows the club to spend hundreds of millions today despite being nowhere near the top of the table.",
      "But after the retirement of long-time CEO David Gill in 2013, Woodward began to play a bigger role in on-pitch matters. His first summer at the helm was characterised by an inability to bring in targets. Cesc Fabregas and Thiago Alcantara failed to join; the club even had to wait another year to sign Ander Herrera following reports that United officials met with Athletic Bilbao lawyers who were not actually anything to do with the Basque club.",
      "But more than the players the club didn’t sign, Woodward’s biggest mistakes were the ones they did. The club spent £89 million to bring Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford, giving him a £200,000 a week contract for five years.",
      "As their league placement dropped, United attempted to stay in the market for the best players by offering them inflated wage packets. They gave the 19-year-old Anthony Martial £110,000. Bastian Schweinsteiger, deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern (which should have been a hint) was on £240,000. Luke Shaw, a full-back, was on £110,000.",
      "Worst of all, it gave United a reputation for being a club that will spend over the odds. In the first season that Woodward took over, United’s annual salary bill was around £100m. By the time he left in 2022, it was £230m.",
      "The summer after Woodward left, United signed Casemiro giving him £350,000 a week. To put that in context, Virgil van Dijk earns that for being the captain of a Premier League-winning squad. Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland are the only players in the league who earn more and all three of them signed their contracts this year, not back in 2022.",
      "United’s wage structure was blown out of the water by Woodward and trying to reel it back in while remaining competitive is proving to be an impossible task.",
      "Apportioning blame to a man who delivered 38 major trophies to a club may seem harsh but Ferguson was much more than a football manager.",
      "For more than two decades, Ferguson was Manchester United, for all the good and all the bad but his most egregious error came away from the pitch and was one born out of ego and selfishness.",
      "If football was the day job, Ferguson’s love was the racecourse. A huge horse racing fan, Ferguson became pals with John Magnier and JP McManus, the two richest men in Ireland and horse race owners. Ferguson convinced them to purchase shares in United, making them the second largest owners behind BSkyB.",
      "All was well until Ferguson was named as one of the owners of Rock of Gibraltar, a horse from the Coolmore stables owned by the Irish pair. The reasoning was good-natured enough: they wanted Ferguson to be the speaker at an event where rules dictated only owners could do so and they had a long-standing friendship with the Scot.",
      "But then, as it usually does, money turned things sour. The horse unexpectedly became rather good and was named European Horse of the Year in 2002. The friendship changed when Ferguson, as an owner, suggested he would be owed some of the stud rights (the right to breed with the horse in the hope of producing another champion) which are far more valuable than any race winnings.",
      "The Irish duo claimed Ferguson’s ownership was an honorary title and no such rights were due but the United boss did not back down and an enormous fallout occurred, eventually ending in a £2.5m out-of-court settlement for Ferguson after a long legal battle.",
      "But that money was only the second biggest effect of the affair which compelled both the Irish pair to sell their United shares to sever ties with Ferguson. And who was waiting in the wings? The Glazers.",
      "Could the Glazers have agreed a deal anyway? Maybe, but without the fallout with Ferguson, the Irish duo may not have parted with their shares and opened the door for the club to become a vehicle to line the Glazers’ pockets.",
      "Ferguson was already a rich man and had he not been greedy, the club he helped build may not have been in the mess it is now.",
      "For all the contributions of the mess of the modern-day United, the real genesis of the problem came 3,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "Malcolm Glazer was a wealthy man but his finances were nowhere near the level needed to take over the most successful club in England. Instead, he financed the takeover by putting the club itself as collateral and when he took over, the near debt-free United found itself with £604m on the books.",
      "But buying United was not a passion project for the American family, who also own the NFL team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was an investment. Football was well into the Premier League era and the finances were only going one way; taking control of the biggest club gave the Glazer family access to incredible wealth.",
      "They ‘earned’ this by taking dividends every year which the BBC calculated was around £1.2 billion in total. Instead of using that money to pay off the debt that they themselves put on the club, the Glazers pocketed it. The result is United have a debt now worth over £1 billion.",
      "The Glazers have also been very hands-off when it came to running the club. Ferguson and Gill papered over the cracks in the early years but when those two figureheads left, the Glazers kept a distance, using Woodward as their man to run things.",
      "They have also been incredibly stagnant when it comes to facilities. Old Trafford, once the envy of clubs across the country, is run down and susceptible to a leaking roof every time there is more than a slight downpour in Manchester. When favourite son Cristiano Ronaldo returned in 2022, he was dismayed to find the facilities were the same as when he had left.",
      "Two decades of Glazer rule has left the club a shell of what it once was. The badge on the door may still say Manchester United but underneath it, the club is entirely different from the early 2000s.",
      "The Glazers’ apathy has been the biggest killer of Manchester United, far more than any manager or executive has been. and yet, they still won’t sell because frankly why would you? Malcolm Glazer died in 2014 with his sons Avram, Joel and Bryan happy to pick up the ticket for the gravy train.",
      "In 2024, they sold 30% of their shares for a fee of £732m but their pockets have long been filled.",
      "Before the takeover was completed in 2005, the then-United board warned that taking on that level of debt would cause “a downward spiral in both team and financial performance.” In the 20 years that has followed, they have been proven right.",

      "Malacia had been training with the U21s since being frozen out but as Amorim pledged in July, he has been brought back into the first-team fold with the transfer window shut.",
      "Even during his exile Malacia earned rave reviews for his commitment.",
      "His ‘intensity’ was described as ‘off the charts’ and his ‘attitude’ regarded as ‘an example for everybody else’, according to Chris Wheeler of the Daily Mail.",
      "It is also said that Malacia ‘requested to be allowed to play for the U21s’ during his time with them but that opportunity never transpired.",
      "Dutch outlet Voetbal International adds that while Malacia’s return to the fold was ‘against all odds’, Amorim ‘will give the left-back a serious chance to fight his way back into the team’.",
      "“We got to see him for the first time reintegrated back into the first team this morning. We got a glimpse of open training with Ruben Amorim’s squad.",
      "“Remember, this was a player who was training away from the group alongside the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. But Ruben Amorim was always very adamant that any player who didn’t get a move away from the club would be reintegrated into the first team and that is exactly what has happened with Tyrell Malacia.",
      "“He had a meeting with Amorim, as I understand it, this week. He has been training with the U21s for the last few weeks to get some fitness back amongst the group.",
      "“It’s been described to me as he’s had an outstanding attitude in training with the U21s, he’s been a great influence on that squad, and he has now back with the first team.",
      "“This is a player who’s had a really challenging few seasons, first of all through injury. But then also just not really being involved in the first-team picture. He last represented Manchester United on January 26 in the Premier League.",
      "“But this was always part of the plan. He was part of the Premier League squad that was submitted at the beginning of the season. He’s another option for Ruben Amorim to look at at that left wing-back position in a side that is conceding somewhat soft goals.",
      "“It might be a few weeks before he gets that match fitness back, but it was good from a fan perspective to see those pictures of Tyrell Malacia, backing up what Ruben Amorim had to say in the summer.”",

      "‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his gang of Manchester United revolutionaries are looking at alternative options to Erik ten Hag, who seems increasingly unlikely to last beyond the summer’ we wrote in May 2024 when we first put forward some reasons why Gareth Southgate would *actually* be good for United.",
      "At that stage links to the England manager provoked head-shaking en masse from Red Devils fans, who refused to even consider the appointment of a man who unilaterally prevented the actual Golden Generation from winning three major tournaments on the bounce over, say, a very charming man from Portugal. What they needed was a clear philosophy and system, not good will and vibes, FFS.",
      "There was more than a whiff of rage-bating in our last Southgate to United rationale, but the mess that’s been Ruben Amorim’s Old Trafford tenure makes Ratcliffe sticking him on the shortlist of possible replacements less ‘bemusing’ than ever.",
      "",
      "Togetherness\nPut your cynicism aside for a second, difficult though it is not to imagine Southgate as a travelling team-building consultant stood in front of half-asleep employees with this one word on a whiteboard behind him: “What does togetherness mean to you?”",
      "Because the Manchester United players could really do with a week of inset days to hammer home what it means to pull in the same direction and support each other.",
      "The dressing-room remains as leaky as a discount diaper and Ratcliffe should consider splashing out on name-brand nappies to failsafe against the collective sh*tting of the bed from United players at the first sign of strife.",
      "Southgate may not be the greatest tactician, but there can be no doubting his ability to improve the ethos and dynamics of a dressing-room, having picked England up off the floor after they were thunder-clapped out of Euro 2016 and leading them to a place where each and every player enjoyed wearing the shirt which used to weigh heavy to the point of paralysis.",
      "It’s been a long time since Manchester United players looked as though they were enjoying their football as much as the England stars did under the former Middlesbrough boss, with Ten Hag and Ruben Amorim’s teams as burdened as the pre-Southgate Three Lions.",
      "",
      "Dan Ashworth was so right\nGareth Southgate consistently and vehemently praised the impact of Dan Ashworth on England in their time working for the FA together, crediting the 159-day United sporting director for the country’s success at youth level, which translated to the significant improvement of the senior team under Southgate’s watch. And the respect is mutual.",
      "“Gareth is an exceptional leader,” Ashworth said ahead of the 2018 World Cup, just before he upped sticks for Brighton. “The environment that has been created is down to him. He’s got a really good understanding of getting the best out of the players and staff. So what’s ended up happening is that Gareth has brought together a way of working for the players and the staff that means it is one big group of people. He has to take the credit.”",
      "We’re not about to suggest that United should follow the advice of a man they a) sacked after five months, and b) voted in favour of keeping Ten Hag after the 2023/2024 season, but he was so right about the ‘mass disruption’ hiring Amorim and his very specific style wholly unsuited to the United squad would cause that you’ve got to wonder if he might have been just as spot on with Southgate being the best bet to help them crawl out of the hole they continue to dig for themselves.",
      "",
      "Philosophy schmilosophy\nWho better to replace a man roundly criticised for his stubborn insistence on a failing system and philosophy than a man who never really had either?",
      "Southgate’s critics claimed he failed to get the best out of one the greatest crops of attacking English talent in history and we’ll get a better sense as to whether that’s fair or not when we see what Thomas Tuchel’s Three Lions produce at the 2026 World Cup. We would be surprised if they do any better.",
      "He got them to two major tournament finals, largely by – and we know this sounds mad – looking at the players he had available to him and coming up with a formation to get the best out of those players.",
      "Now, we know that didn’t always work and there were square pegs in round holes at times. But it’s not as though there was some sort of naturalisation window where he could bring in ‘his players’ from other nations. He had to make do with what he was given and we’re guessing that will be a very attractive quality in a new Manchester United manager for Ratcliffe and the Ineos bosses.",
      "He won’t do anything revolutionary. He’s not about to rip up Premier League playbooks. Four at the back. Two sitting midfielders behind Bruno Fernandes in the No.10. Couple of wingers. Striker. Sorted. And Manchester United will be so much better for it.",
      "",
      "Homegrown focus\nIt was claimed at the start of his tenure that Sir Jim was keen on signing homegrown talent as part of his changes to the recruitment model at United. He ‘wanted to reinforce a domestic flavour’, which sounds suspiciously Brexit-y, but is likely – just as deplorably – to be connected with a desire for more Manchester United DNA.",
      "We don’t quite know what’s happened since as literally none of Ratcliffe’s £430m-odd outlay has been spent on homegrown players, while Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford have all p*ssed off and Kobbie Mainoo hasn’t yet but is certainly p*ssed. In fact, all evidence points to Ratcliffe hating British footballers. Might make that our headline.",
      "There’s bound to be a patriotic shift under Southgate, who could prove to be quite the carrot for new signings of the correct heritage, but would also surely put Mainoo straight back into the starting lineup, as he should be anyway, having picked him for Euro 2024 after half a season of senior football, before selecting him (admittedly after some Conor Gallagher, Trent Alexander-Arnold nonsense) as Declan Rice’s midfield partner.",
      "We know he’s a big fan of Mason Mount and it’s hard to see a manger getting less out of him than either Ten Hag or Amorim. And while there might be a slight concern as to just how enduring his love is for Harry Maguire and whether that might see him start each and every game, if Matthijs de Ligt plays as he did against Brentford then that is absolutely what should be happening.",
      "",
      "The press conference charisma\nIt was supposedly an obsession with Amorim’s charisma which played no small part in Ratcliffe and Ineos plumping for him as their manager, and we can’t think of anything other than the Portuguese manager’s charm that’s keeping him in the job right now. If anything, he’s honest to a fault, but that makes him a very difficult man to dislike, and there’s no doubting his ability to hold a room.",
      "Southgate is also excellent in a press conference. Not in the same smiley, jovial, self-deprecating way, but when he speaks, you listen and the United bosses can rest assured that they’re in the safe hands of a company man should they appoint him.",
      "There will be plenty of Red Devils fans who couldn’t give two shiny sh*ts about how good their leader is with the media, but like it or not, the way in which a manager is perceived, spoken and written about makes a significant difference to the time they’re given to implement ideas on the pitch and, more crucially, is a fairly good indication as to how they’re dealing with the players. Southgate could soothe the Old Trafford disorder.",
      "Man Utd have been accused of planning to install Gareth Southgate as their new manager while Ruben Amorim is still in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Gareth Southgate has decided his ‘stance’ on replacing Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Members of the Man Utd technical team are reportedly ‘bemused’ by one of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s picks to be their next manager, according to reports.",
      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate is “definitely” someone that Man Utd are “looking at” to replace Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Surely there is nobody – not even Ruben Amorim – who thinks that Ruben Amorim should not be sacked by Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been in ‘direct contact’ with Gareth Southgate as Ruben Amorim faces being sacked."

      "Club chiefs foolishly decided to focus mainly on attacking signings, with around £200m spent to land Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. This is quite the feat considering they were said to be at risk of running out of money this year…",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have impressed in flashes, though Man Utd remain just as incohesive in attack as they were last season, with more attention needed to be placed on recruits in supporting areas.",
      "The Red Devils did, however, look to address the goalkeeping department, though they settled on relatively unproven 23-year-0ld Senne Lamhers despite being linked with cut-price moves for Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez, both of whom would have been clear upgrades on Andre Onana.",

      "United’s naysayers have rightly argued that they need to target a top-tier goalkeeper with a strong personality, a la Donnarumma or Martinez, to cope with the demands of being a No.1 at Old Trafford, with this sentiment further fuelled by Amorim’s refusal to start Lammens ahead of Alter Bayindir, who is certainly not good enough to be anything more than a No.2 for a big club.",

      "“They brought in Senne Lammens but he’s not starting yet, he’s a young lad who’s only had one full season in football. I don’t know why when you’ve got Donnarumma or Martinez available, the situation wasn’t resolved.”",
      "And the feeling that Lammens is a pointless signing would be confirmed if Man Utd sign another goalkeeper in 2026, which they are reportedly planning to do.",
      "According to journalist Fraser Fletcher in a report for our pals at TEAMtalk, Man Utd are ‘competing’ with Chelsea to sign AC Milan standout Mike Maignan, who is due to be out of contract next summer, as they plot a transfer hijack.",

      "At this stage, it would not be surprising if/when Chelsea beat Man Utd to Maignan as they did with Liam Delap, but the reported interest from the Red Devils is alarming, as it poses the question: Why on earth did they sign Lammens?",

      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",

      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",

      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",

      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",

      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",

      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",
      "\"It could not have gone any worse and I feel for him. He is a young manager and he has had a great start to his career, what he did at Sporting Lisbon was really special. But those results for a club of that stature are just beyond belief.",
      "\"You don't want to see anybody lose their job but I think it would just be better for everyone if they just shake hands and move on.\"",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "\"He's going to hit that first time. The pace is on the cross and all he is going to do is redirect the ball towards the corner.",
      "\"He's not going to control that in a million years.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR Darren England intervenes after referee Jarred Gillett awarded a penalty to Arsenal after Nick Pope appeared to foul Viktor Gyokeres. The referee changed his mind after looking at the screen and overturned the decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",
      "\"Pope does get a touch on the ball. My immediate instinct was penalty... but Pope does plant his foot so he doesn't follow through with the tackle so that's why it was overturned.",
      "\"This year, they've tried to stick with the on-field decision as much as possible, but once the VAR looks at it, he's decided that Pope has played the ball - that's the key factor.",
      "\"He's sent the referee to the screen but he can still hold his ground. He can still say it's a penalty. Referees take everything into consideration - where the ball is going, the direction of play, would the player have got it?\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",
      "Amorim has been in the job for 10 months and is yet to win consecutive games in the league. Momentum feels extremely distant right now."

      "Saturday 27 September 2025 21:20, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes had a penalty saved as Manchester United fell to a 3-1 defeat at Brentford to put the spotlight back on Ruben Amorim as his search for back-to-back league wins continues.",
      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",
      "Fernandes' second failure from the spot this season ultimately cost United, who are now winless in their last eight away league games and back in the bottom half as Brentford climb above them thanks to a richly deserved three points.",
      "Brentford Kelleher (7), Kayode (8), Collins (7) Van den Berg (7), Hickey (7), Henderson (8), Yarmoliuk (8), Ouattara (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (8), Thiago (9). \n\n\nSubs: Lewis-Potter (6), Henry (6), Onyeka (6), Janelt (6), Jensen (7).\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6), De Ligt (5), Maguire (5), Shaw (5), Dalot (4), Ugarte (5), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (5),  Mbeumo (5), Sesko (6), Cunha (5).\n\n\nSubs:  Mainoo (6), Yoro (5), Mount (5), ZIrkzee (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Igor Thiago.",
      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
