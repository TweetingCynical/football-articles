      "Manchester United want to get three deals wrapped up before the summer transfer window closes. United have made two significant additions so far this summer but still trail their Premier League rivals, who have been extremely busy.",
      "The club have spent £133.5million to bring in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, while young left-back Diego Leon has also arrived after signing in January. United have found it hard going in the market, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City all completing more deals so far.",
      "The Aston Villa striker is keen on a move to Old Trafford, but United won’t pay £60m for his services, hoping to shake hands at £40-45m. They have also held talks with Benjamin Sesko’s representatives and he is an alternative.",
      "While a centre-forward is the top priority after a miserable 2024/25 season, Ruben Amorim still wants to strengthen elsewhere too. The Independent reports that they also want a new goalkeeper and a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "United are looking for a new keeper after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for Bayindir to fail to take his chance when it came, too.",
      "They have been linked with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, as well as Newcastle’s Nick Pope and Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Meanwhile, an athletic holding midfielder is wanted by Amorim following a succession of issues last season in the position. Casemiro does not have the legs to cover the ground required, Kobbie Mainoo is better further forward and Manuel Ugarte is yet to convince following his £50m move from PSG last summer.",
      "Amorim has recently explained what he’s looking for in new signings. “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already,\" he said.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ollie Watkins owes a huge part of his emergence to the partnership he forged with Bryan Mbeumo at Brentford with the pair now potentially reuniting at Manchester United as the club continue their summer recruitment.",
      "Watkins remains at Aston Villa whilst Mbeumo recently made the switch to the Red Devils, but both men formed part of a fearsome trio back during their Brentford days when the Bees were aiming to become a Premier League outfit.",
      "Said Benrahma was also part the attack but it was only Mbeumo who stayed with Brentford for the long haul. Watkins' goals saw Villa come calling whilst Benrahma headed to West Ham and is now in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The season they spent together in the Championship the trio scored 59 times between them as Brentford made it to the play-off final. This year just passed Mbeumo had a career-best year at Brentford and Watkins, who endured a frustrating season at Villa Park, came up with 17 goals.",
      "United are now eyeing a move for Watkins to further bolster their attack and the Englishman previously admitted he would love to have continued playing with Mbeumo.",
      "He said back in the Brentford days: \"I feel like coming from the bottom makes you hungry and you are always striving for more, so I am not surprised these two (Mbeumo and Benrahma) have been in the lower leagues and worked their way to the top and hopefully we can keep going up together.\"",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping track on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko situation but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are the most likely destination the 22-year-old Slovenian as they weigh up replacements for Alexander Isak.",
      "The Red Devils want a proven goalscorer and throughout the summer United have adopted a policy of signing players who are used to the Premier League with Mbeumo's signing coming after they had also landed Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",

      "Since Alexander Isak informed Newcastle United that he would like to leave, the Magpies have been linked with a move for Sesko. Eddie Howe's side are in a position to offer Champions League football and the involvement in a football project which has been amassing a huge amount of momentum.",
      "\"That's the first thing (they ask). 'Are you in the Champions League?' A lot of players want to be near the big cities. They want to be near Manchester, they want to be in London and their families want to be there.",
      "\"You're fighting, geographically, if you are up in Newcastle and that's just the nature of a footballer's mentality, I'm afraid. They might be drawn to whether they have friends at other clubs as well, or friends of their wives and families are a big part of that.",
      "\"There are a lot of things to contend with. More so than what you see in front of your eyes on some occasions.\"",
      "United appear to be embroiled in a transfer battle with Newcastle for Sesko's services. The promising Slovenian is amongst Europe's most coveted prospects and had previously caught Arsenal's eye, before the Gunners shifted their focus towards securing Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP.",
      "Newcastle's summer dealings hint they may be waging an uphill struggle in their pursuit of Sesko. Whilst they did secure former United winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55m, the majority of their priority targets have rejected the club's advances.",
      "Joao Pedro, Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Cunha and, most recently, James Trafford were all courted by the Magpies, but opted join Chelsea, United and Manchester City. Now the Magpies – who are competing in the Champions League – face the prospect of losing star striker Isak.",

      "Manchester United are determined to sign a striker before the Premier League season begins. Ruben Amorim has already been given much-needed attacking reinforcements in the summer transfer window, but there's still a missing piece of the puzzle.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have arrived for a combined fee of £133.5million, but United are in real need of more goals. Cunha scored 15 goals in the Premier League last season for Wolves, while Mbeumo struck 20 for Brentford, yet neither are comfortable as a No.9.",
      "That is where United have been trying to find a new player. But with no European football to offer targets, having finished a lowly 15th last season, they missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal.",
      "United are, however, unwilling to pay Aston Villa's £60m valuation for the England star. Instead, they hope to negotiate down to around £40-45m for the 29-year-old forward.",
      "One of the things in their favour is that Watkins is understood to be keen on the move. While he has been an important player for Villa in recent years, he has clashed with Unai Emery over selection in the Champions League and would undoubtedly be the main man at United, where rotation would be less of an issue.",
      "Jadon Sancho had appeared to be set for a move to Juventus, but a third spell at Borussia Dortmund is now thought to be a serious possibility for the winger. Sancho is part of the bomb squad at United, having been told he has no future at the club under Amorim's management.",
      "He had agreed terms with Fenerbahce last month, before that move collapsed. Next came Juventus, with the Italian side thought to be close to signing the 25-year-old for £21.6m.",
      "According to reports, United could now flog Sancho to Dortmund for £15-17m, giving him a third spell at the club. Sancho made his name in Germany initially, joining United for £73m on the back of his form there, and also spent time on loan at Dortmund in 2024.",
      "Manchester United won't be signing Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea this summer. Jackson is exploring his options after the arrivals of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap left him contemplating a season on the bench. United held talks with his agent, but Chelsea's asking price has put them off.",
      "The Blues floated the figure of £100million, with an actual valuation of £80m still way too high for the Senegal international, who has a typically ludicrous but classic Chelsea contract expiry date of June 2033.",
      "Watkins is now United's No.1 target, with Sesko another option. United have spoken to Sesko's agent, but he is younger, more inexperienced and has no Premier League experience.",

      "Manchester United are keen on signing Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins this summer - but the club are reluctant to overpay for a player who turns 30 in December. And Arsenal had the same concerns before pulling out of the race to sign the England international.",
      "The Gunners explored a move for Watkins in January, but decided over the summer that Viktor Gyokeres was the answer to their needs up front. United have also looked at whether they might be able to land the forward, but are some way from an agreement.",
      "According to reports from The Athletic back in May, the Gunners' new sporting director Andrea Berta was unconvinced by the prospect of paying north of £40million for a player of Watkins' age. Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike were mentioned as potential alternatives at the time, though both have since joined different Premier League clubs.",
      "As an alternative, Amorim's side have spoken to Villa about the possibility of including Alejandro Garnacho in a player-plus-cash deal. Villa took Marcus Rashford on loan from United for the second half of last season, and Garnacho could yet fill the gap left by Rashford's decision to spend the upcoming season at Barcelona.",
      "In five Premier League seasons, Watkins has scored 75 league goals for Villa. His best return came in the 2023-24 season, when he bagged 19 in the league and 27 in all competitions.",
      "He finished last season with 16 in the league as Villa narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification. No United player ended up with more than eight.",
      "United have been in the United States for their pre-season responsibilities, earning a win against West Ham during the Premier League Summer series. After that victory, boss Amorim said he had yet to decide on his preferred XI for the league opener against Arsenal in mid-August.",
      "\"It's a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team,\" Amorim said. \"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been a serious target for a few Premier League teams this summer, including Manchester United and Newcastle. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Anita Vidovic, has also caught the attention of fans, especially given she is five years his senior.",
      "Sesko has been a standout player for RB Leipzig, scoring an impressive 21 goals across all competitions in the 2024/25 season. Despite the Bundesliga team's lacklustre performance, which saw them finish outside the top four, the Slovenian international remained a consistent force on the pitch.",
      "Ruben Amorim and United's hierarchy have noticed Sesko's prowess, but they're not the only ones. Newcastle are also keen to secure Sesko's services, particularly as Alexander Isak is now looking to explore other transfer options this summer.",
      "After extending his contract until 2029 last summer, Sesko will likely take some time to decide his next move. One person he'll likely turn to for advice is his girlfriend, Anita Vidovic.",
      "Cosmopolitan report the 27-year-old is originally from Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, and graduated from the Faculty of Public Administration.",
      "Anita is no stranger to the world of football. Her brother Boris has made 25 professional appearances in Germany and Poland's lower leagues, playing for teams like TSV Bicken and Ritzing.",
      "The 28-year-old hung up his boots in 2024 and has since ventured into reality television, featuring in series 12 of Love Island as a Casa Amor bombshell. Whilst it remains unconfirmed, it's probable that the elder Vidovic supports Sesko in the same way as his sister, who regularly appears wearing her boyfriend's football shirt on social media.",
      "The Leipzig striker rarely shares posts about his partner on his social platforms, restricting Anita's appearances to the occasional Instagram grid post. On the other hand, the 27-year-old WAG displays her man's romantic side on her TikTok often.",
      "Garnering approximately 20,000 views per clip, Anita reveals Sesko's affectionate acts for birthdays, anniversaries and other memorable moments. Videos of the duo dancing, sharing warm embraces and travelling the world together fill her feed, alongside her cheering on the forward from the stands at Leipzig.",
      "In one post from early 2025, Anita compiled numerous romantic footage of the pair and wrote, \"It was always you,\" alongside a white love-heart emoji.",
      "Footage shows Sesko playing with a young lion cub, demonstrating his skills at the driving range, enjoying a basketball match and dancing aboard a boat with his girlfriend.",
      "United supporters will be hoping that Anita will persuade her partner to choose the Red Devils over other possible Premier League clubs, but it appears her influence may not be required.",
      "Sesko has reportedly been impressed by United's strategy and their eagerness to secure a deal. It's suggested he received concrete figures about what he could earn and bring to Amorim's vision.",
      "It's been reported that Sesko and Leipzig have a 'gentlemen's agreement', suggesting the 22-year-old could depart for a 'special club'. Given their rich history and trophy haul, United certainly fit the bill.",
      "However, given Eddie Howe's Carabao Cup-winning side are also interested in Sesko, their ability to offer Champions League football could tempt the Slovenian star.",
      "With other clubs eyeing Sesko, it appears Amorim and United's top brass will need to act swiftly to secure the forward. However, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is another player on United's radar, indicating it won't be a case of signing both.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is ready to show up Manchester United’s departing players after highlighting the importance of defending in his game. United last week announced the arrival of Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal which could reach £71million.",
      "The 25-year-old is an exciting addition to Ruben Amorim’s forward line, which struggled for goals last season. Mbeumo will certainly add that, with 20 Premier League finishes for the Bees last season showcasing his eye for goal, while his blistering pace will also add a new dynamic to United’s attacking trident.",
      "Yet, during an interview on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the Cameroon international highlighted another skill of his which was undoubtedly a factor in Amorim pushing so hard to sign him this summer - his impressive defensive work-rate.",
      "The forward was asked by United legend Ferdinand about his efforts on the other end of the pitch, to which he replied: “It’s really important to attack and defend as a team. I think if just one of us doesn’t defend, it makes space for the opponents and they can get through.”",
      "Providing a nine-word comment which his new boss will love, Mbeumo said: “It’s really important to defend well as a team.” He added: “Of course it’s easier to regain the ball [that way] as well.”",
      "His emphasis on defending is in stark contrast to the forwards that have played and failed under Amorim since his appointment in November. Antony, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are three members of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ this summer.",
      "They were all told to find new clubs at the start of the summer and forced to train away from the first-team. While discipline and poor form were also factors in Red Devils chiefs deciding to part ways with the players, all three, along with returning loanee Jadon Sancho, have been accused of poor defensive workrate in the past.",
      "Much of Amorim’s success at Sporting CP, where he won two league titles, was built on hard defensive graft and winning the ball back aggressively high up the pitch, with press traps leading to quick transitions to attack.",
      "That is part of the reason why the Portuguese tactician relied so heavily on Amad last season compared to some of United’s flashier forward options. The Ivorian registered more tackles, duels and recoveries than Rashford and Garnacho, while repaying Amorim’s trust by scoring 11 goals and providing 10 assists in all competitions.",
      "Under the defensive-minded Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mbeumo was certainly no slouch either. He covered more ground than any other forward in the league last season, along with providing the most crosses (202) and the most expected assists (9.3).",
      "His intention to continue working hard in both attack and defence will be music to the ears of not only Amorim but also United's fanbase, who've expressed their frustrations with the likes of Rashford for his lack of tracking back on multiple occasions in the past.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "New Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo will not be fazed by playing in front of 75,000 fans at Old Trafford. But ask him to play the piano – a hobby he took up to relax away from football – in front of a few people and the forward is gripped by anxiety.",
      "“The piano just makes me take time for me and relax myself in my free time,” said Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million.",
      "“But the thing is, I don't really like to play in front of people. It’s funny, but it’s so different. Even if I play in front of a couple of friends at home, I'm not exactly shaking but it’s 'oh guys, this is kind of hard for me'.”",
      "As well as the piano, Mbeumo has developed a passion for chess and plays online anonymously, his opponents unaware they are up against a Premier League superstar. “Playing online is anonymous,” said Mbeumo. “I have a username, you choose a nickname and just play against random people online.",
      "“With chess, there is a lot of thought. When you play football, you have to think as well. Playing chess, you can see some moves ahead, because it's a strategy game. In football you have your strategy as well so you can link them together.",
      "“I’m not crazy good. But if you know the rating, I'm like 800 on chess.com. There was a period when I was really, really into it, watching videos on YouTube and doing training on the app. For the brain, it's really, really good and you can develop new skills.",
      "“Obviously you're doing football most of the time, every day, so sometimes you don't really have time to develop other skills. But I like creativity and stuff.”",
      "Mbeumo had approaches from other clubs who could offer him Champions League football next season, like Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, but chose United because of the challenge of helping to resurrect the fallen giants.",
      "“I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects,” said Mbeumo, who scored 20 league goals last season. “But the Manchester United one was very good for me.",
      "“United is a big club. It’s a great opportunity and I chose the project. I'm someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project here and I wanted to be a part of it.",
      "“I always trust my people around me. The transfer window can be long, it can be short. So you have to be patient and just try to keep thinking positively about things.",
      "“I was obviously on my holidays, so I just wanted to think about resting mentally and physically. But I was convinced that it was going to happen.",
      "“The manager said 'we are people who like winning and we want to be the best team'. It was a very friendly conversation. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",
      "“Another part as well is because you want to play on the greatest stages in the world and Old Trafford is one of them. So being able to play there every two weeks is big.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "New Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo has set himself a target of bettering his total of 20 Premier League goals last season. Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, reckons he can take his game to another level following his move to Old Trafford.",
      "United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and versatile forward Mbeumo is confident he can provide the answer to their scoring woes. “As a striker and for myself, I always want to be better than I was yesterday,” said Mbeumo. “I’m very demanding of myself and I always try to do my best. I don’t like to put limits on myself as well.”",
      "Mbeumo can play across the front line, on the left, on the right and through the middle as a striker, and said he will play wherever United boss Ruben Amorim feels he will be most effective. “I think now, in football, you have to be adaptable and to be able to play in a few other positions than what you’d say is your best,” said Mbeumo.",
      "“I think it's really good to gain experience. Obviously I played as a winger mainly at Brentford, but I don’t have one specific position where I feel I can do the best.",
      "“But with Brentford I used to also play as a No.10 in the pocket or even as a No.9. I can play all those positions. Of course it will help me, because I’ve played in many formations before.",
      "“But obviously it's different because it's a new new time now and every season is different. But whatever position the gaffer wants to put me in, I will play there.”",
      "Mbeumo went on to confirm that he had interest from other clubs including Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham but after talking to Amorim, his mind was made up. “I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects,” said Mbeumo.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has warned that it would be \"lights out\" for the rest of the Premier League if Liverpool complete the signing of Alexander Isak. The ex-England star also eulogised over Liverpool's business this summer.",
      "Despite already securing the services of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, the Reds maintain an active interest in 25-year-old Swedish striker Isak, with the player having informed Newcastle that he would like to explore a move away from the club.",
      "Isak is not on their pre-season tour of Asia either as speculation over a huge switch to Anfield intensifies. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, however, has confirmed they are yet to receive any formal offers for Isak, but officials at St James' Park are said to be keen on RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko as they ramp up their search for a potential replacement.",
      "While a transfer for Isak remains in a state of flux, speaking on his podcast, Rio Presents, Ferdinand waxed lyrical over the Reds' activity this summer. Despite being an icon of Liverpool's greatest rivals, Ferdinand – rather than show any bias – couldn't help show his true colours as a football pundit and relay his real belief that Isak would help secure Arne Slot a second Premier League title on the spin.",
      "\"Liverpool's transfer window has been nothing short of exceptional so far. It's been an outrageous transfer window, and if they get Isak – it's lights out for the Premier League,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"They've got a squad there, they've got a hierarchy, they look stable, they look solid. It's gone too well and if they get Isak, it's over.\"",
      "Liverpool are hunting for attacking reinforcements, particularly with Luis Diaz poised to join Bayern Munich. Slot and club chiefs believe that Isak would suit their forward line perfectly and link up well with new signing Ekitike, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for an initial £69 million last week.",
      "However, luring Isak away from St James' Park won't be straightforward, with the Magpies said to be demanding a whopping fee of up to £150 million to sell their prized asset, reports the Liverpool Echo. Newcastle have attributed Isak's continued absence to a minor thigh problem, having also omitted him from their squad for their pre-season clash away at Celtic.",
      "When quizzed about his star forward's future, Howe said: \"He is still our player. He's contracted to us. We, to a degree, control what is next for him.\"",
      "Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, have gone on a summer splurge, with nearly £300m spent so far. Former Red and prolific goalscorer Robbie Fowler reckons Isak would be the perfect finishing touch to a frenzied few months of activity.",
      "\"As a Liverpool fan, we would all love to see him, wouldn't we,\" Fowler told The RedMen TV. \"When you look at the Premier League and the goals he scored last year, the types of goals and his performances, he was phenomenal. Hopefully, he can carry that on, and hopefully it will be at Liverpool.",
      "\"If you were to pick one player from the Premier League last year who you would have wanted to sign for Liverpool, he would probably be on 90 per cent of people's lips. We probably needed that pivotal striker on the pitch last season. He could be the difference if he were to come.\"",

      "Rene Meulensteen believes that Conor Gallagher would be a perfect fit for Manchester United, especially given Casemiro's age. The Brazilian midfielder, who joined the Red Devils in a £70million move from Real Madrid in 2022, has shined at times at Old Trafford.",
      "However, at 33 years old, there are questions pertaining to his suitability to Ruben Amorim's demanding and fast-paced style of play, with his future in the north west being cast into question at the end of last season. Despite being linked to a move to the Saudi Pro League this summer with just a year left on his current deal in Manchester, Casemiro has ultimately decided to stay put.",
      "But Meulensteen believes that United should still be looking for a replacement ahead of his deal running down next summer, picking out Atletico Madrid star Gallagher as the ideal candidate. Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, the former United first-team coach said: \"Conor Gallagher would bring bags of energy to Manchester United, that is something they have been lacking in the middle of the park.",
      "\"There is Manuel Ugarte there, but I don’t think he has the best legs in terms of covering distances. We don’t know what is happening with Casemiro, if he will still be part of the squad after playing more games than expected last year. I thought Gallagher was very good for Chelsea, he's a hardworking boy who covers the ground quickly, he’s tenacious, he is someone that could fit in.\"",
      "It's not the first time that United have been urged to sign the 25-year-old England international either, with Gordon Strachan also highlighting Gallagher as a suitable player at Old Trafford earlier this month. In conversation with OLBG, the 68-year-old said: \"Man United don't need a bit more bite, they need legs, real legs, real closing down.",
      "\"Can Conor Gallagher do that? Yes he can, he's definitely got legs, he's a good team-mate. Has he got enough imagination? I don't know, but if you have people like that with legs in there and have imagination around them, then he'd be a good signing.",
      "\"The days of the luxury player, if you want to be a top side, are gone. So, Conor Gallagher has definitely got the legs. He's got the robustness. Has he got goals? Has he got that flair?",
      "\"These players are hard to come by. Would I take him compared to some of the players that have played over the last couple of years at Man United? Yes, I would.\"",
      "After breaking through the youth academy of Chelsea in 2019, Gallagher spent five years with the Blues, albeit, the majority of his tenure was spent on loan with the likes of Charlton, Swansea, West Brom and Crystal Palace. A £34m move to Atletico Madrid then ensued last summer, with Gallagher thriving in La Liga with Los Rojiblancos.",
      "In his maiden season, Gallagher scored four goals and provided six assists in 50 outings and was imperative to Atleti's third-place finish in La Liga. Amorim is currently focusing on securing a proven No. 9 for United ahead of next season, with Ollie Watkins at the top of his list.",
      "While Aston Villa have said that their talisman is not for sale this summer, they valued Watkins at £60m in January, and it is thought that the Red Devils will try to broker a deal for around £45m. However, if they are unsuccessful, they may opt to continue their pursuit of 22-year-old RB Leipzig star, Benjamin Sesko, given they are thought to hold a pole position over Newcastle United in securing the striker - who is also valued at around £60m - this summer.",

      "Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the United legend took a cautiously optimistic stab at predicting where his former club might finish in 2025/26. \"I'm going eighth. Seventh or eighth,\" he said, before adding an important caveat: \"Revisit this if we get one or two more signings and I might change my answer.\"",
      "United have already bolstered their attack by signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and are looking to land a new centre forward before the window closes. After missing out on Liam Delap, Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike - who joined Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool respectively - the club have now turned their attention to other targets.",
      "They've trimmed their shortlist down to two names: Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Both strikers are reportedly open to a move to Old Trafford, though no official approaches have been made yet.",
      "With Marcus Rashford loaned out to Barcelona and confidence in Rasmus Hojlund waning - amid speculation that he too could leave - the club are short on firepower. Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho are also expected to be offloaded, making attacking reinforcements a top priority.",
      "But there's a financial balancing act at play, particularly amid ongoing Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) concerns. United have already spent £133.5million this summer - more than Manchester City and Tottenham, and just £2m shy of Arsenal's total outlay - and a big-money striker signing could push their expenditure close to the £200m mark.",
      "RB Leipzig are holding out for over £60m for Sesko, while Aston Villa are expected to demand a similar fee for Watkins. Slovenian international Sesko, who netted 21 goals in all competitions last season, had previously been in talks with Arsenal, though the Gunners ultimately pivoted to Gyokeres.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea have since cooled their interest in the 22-year-old, but Newcastle remain in the hunt. The Magpies have identified him as their top target should Alexander Isak be sold to Liverpool. While Newcastle hope to retain their star striker, Isak is pushing for a move, casting doubt over his future at St James' Park.",
      "United, meanwhile, are not pursuing Isak, having been deterred by Newcastle's mammoth £150m valuation. Liverpool, however, are optimistic that the fee could be negotiated down due to the player's desire to leave.",
      "As for Watkins, United have long admired the 29-year-old, who netted 16 Premier League goals last term. Although he once described playing for Arsenal as his \"dream\" back in 2020, Gyokeres' arrival in north London makes that scenario unlikely - leaving United in pole position if they choose to make a serious move.",
      "United ended last season 19 points behind Brighton in eighth and a hefty 23 off Nottingham Forest in seventh - so they'll need to improve dramatically for Ferdinand's forecast to become reality.",
      "That said, 2024/25 was a major outlier: it marked the only time the club have finished outside the top eight in the Premier League era, with their last comparable slump being a 13th-place finish back in 1989/90.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo's arrival, however, was much more complicated and Ruben Amorim had to be patient. Weeks of fraught negotiations with Brentford culminated in United agreeing to pay up to £71m for him last Monday.",

      "They're reliant on sales, with four members of Amorim's bomb squad - Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia - still at the club. But that hasn't stopped United from working on deals.",
      "They're not just focussed on attack, as at the other end, Amorim wants competition from Andre Onana. Royal Antwerp prospect Senne Lammens has been linked but now there's chance to sign one of the world's best.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly been made available by Paris Saint-Germain, who've agreed a £34m deal for Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier. Therefore, if United were able to make the finances work, they could offer the Italian - whose contract in Paris expires next summer - a move to the Premier League.",
      "Donnarumma would play behind a three-man defence, something which he's used to at international level. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and the currently injured Lisandro Martinez are likely to be Amorim's preferred defensive trio.",
      "The wing-back positions are crucial for the Red Devils boss and it'll be a battle between Amad, Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui on the right. As for the left-hand side, January signing Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and teenager Diego Leon will compete.",

      "One week into life at Manchester United, and it seems as though Bryan Mbeumo's eyes have been opened. The £65million signing from Brentford signed just in time to join his new club on their pre-season tour of the United States, but it hasn't all been easy.",
      "In fact, the winger has indicated that working under Ruben Amorim has been a significant step up in intensity. At least that was the impression United great Rio Ferdinand was under after recently bumping into the Cameroon international.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, was always liable to raise his standards in different areas after joining one of the biggest clubs in the world this summer. However, Ferdinand revealed the details of their recent catch-up stateside, where Mbeumo appeared somewhat taken aback following his first week of training under Amorim.",
      "\"My man turned around and went, 'My God. Wow,'\" said the Old Trafford icon on Rio Ferdinand Presents after he asked Mbeumo off-camera about the training so far this summer. \"'Like an athletics club, man. It's hard. It's really hard.'",
      "\"So don't ever let the fact these guys are going out and having down time make you think that these guys ain't working. They're working.\"",
      "That second comment was presumably in reference to some fans taking umbrage with United players putting their feet up at times in pre-season. However, six-time Premier League champion Ferdinand agreed it's important for squad members to strike a balance and be allowed to live normal lives amid the pressure of their on-field careers.",
      "It's a testament to the standards Amorim is demanding of his players during his first summer at the United helm. The former Sporting CP boss took over the Red Devils in November 2024 and will look to this summer as vital preparation to improve on a largely disappointing first term at the helm.",
      "It was back in January that Amorim referred to his United squad as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club after a 3-1 loss to Brighton. And despite reaching the Europa League final, where they lost to Tottenham, an all-time low finish of 15th in the Premier League would appear to confirm his appraisal.",
      "As well as Mbeumo, United also broke the bank to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal. And just as Mbeumo has given the lowdown on what life is like under his new manager, Amorim has returned the favour by assessing the differences between his two new major arrivals.",
      "\"[Cunha is] a top player, can play in different positions,\" said the United boss before their recent 2-1 friendly win over West Ham. \"He’s really loud in the dressing room. He’s Brazilian. So I love that on him.",
      "\"He’s completely different from Bryan. Bryan is the opposite. So it’s really fun to combine all the characters and the talent in the club.\"",
      "Cunha made his second United appearance in the win over Graham Potter's men. However, fans are still waiting to get their first glimpse of Mbeumo in club colours, which may come in the Premier League Summer Series showdown against Everton on August 3.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Bruno Fernandes for rejecting the eye-watering sums on offer from the Saudi Pro League – whilst also questioning whether the star is \"mad\" for turning it down. The Manchester United captain was the subject of a failed approach from Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal earlier this summer.",
      "Reports claimed that the club were armed with a £300million package to secure the star, with £100m heading to United and a remarkable £200m contract awaiting Fernandes himself.",
      "Ferdinand, whilst commending the Portuguese midfielder for his loyalty to United, couldn't resist sharing his amazement at the 30-year-old spurning the Saudi club's fortunes.",
      "When quizzed about what he would do when faced with such riches on his podcast, Rio Presents, the former United defender said: \"I'm gone,\" prompting laughter from podcast colleagues Stephen Howson and Flex.",
      "Ferdinand then explained: \"If I'm 25, I'm not [heading to Saudi Arabia]. Don't forget, in our era, China was about – I wouldn't have gone.\"",
      "Discussing the contrast between the appeal of the Saudi Pro League compared to the former influence once wielded by the Chinese Super League, he added: \"In money terms, back then it [Chinese Super League] was [as persuasive as Saudi Arabia]. It's not in terms of location, but it wouldn't have even turned my head going [to] China.",
      "\"But I'm sitting here now, my career is finished, and you look at things differently, and you're turning away £50m a year – I'm offski bruv, get me a lifejacket and I'm swimming there,\" he joked.",
      "When asked about his opinion on Fernades for rejecting the lucrative offer, Ferdinand responded: \"I rate him, but are you mad?",
      "\"I respect it so much and the fans will love him more. He's looking at legacy. We know that this guy [Fernandes] is now about legacy [and not the money].\"",
      "Earlier in the summer, Ferdinand reiterated his sentiments, stating he would have understood if Fernandes had chosen to leave United.",
      "During a press conference for his national team in early June, Fernandes disclosed that he rejected Al-Hilal's incredible offer after discussions with United manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"It would have been easy to move there [Al Hilal]. I know the Portuguese players there very well,\" he admitted. \"But I want to play at the highest level and compete for major titles. I can do that, and I still want to. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go.\"",
      "Following United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, Fernandes was candid about his future with the club. He stated that he would leave the decision regarding his future to United officials, with the club considering selling several of their star players this summer after a disappointing season.",
      "The 30 year old has been a key player for United, scoring 98 goals and providing 87 assists in 290 matches across all competitions since his transfer from Sporting CP in January 2020.",

      "Aston Villa may be simply regurgitating a tactic already deployed by Liverpool this summer in insisting that Ollie Watkins is not for sale despite Manchester United's interest. While Ruben Amorim has secured the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, it is clear that the Portuguese hopes to recruit a proven No. 9 ahead of the new campaign.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with a move for Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres earlier in the window, only for the Swede to commit his future to Arsenal in a £63.7million deal. As a result, United are now said to be pondering the possibility of signing Watkins ahead of the new season.",
      "However, it appears as though United have hit a stumbling block in their ambitions of signing the 29-year-old; the Villans have explained that he isn't for sale. Villa sources insist that Watkins will stay put this summer, although the club did value him at £60m in January when Arsenal showed their own interest, before backtracking when Jhon Duran left to join Al-Nassr.",
      "Whether Villa are serious in retaining Watkins, or if they are deploying mind-games to drive his price up, is up for debate at present, given that United are said to be unwilling to meet their previous £60m price tag and are looking at a more budget-friendly range of between £40m and £45m.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time that such a tactic has been deployed this summer, with Liverpool stating Luis Diaz would remain at Anfield before changing their tune completely. Barcelona expressed an interest in the Colombian last month and even reportedly entered a bid which was quickly rebuffed by the Reds.",
      "Bayern Munich director of sport, Max Eberl, was reportedly told that Liverpool would not enter discussions over Diaz when the Bavarian's made their own approach earlier this summer. Regardless, Bayern submitted an offer of £58.5m for the winger which was quickly turned down, only to return with an improved sum of £65.5m which has since been accepted.",
      "Bayern manager Vincent Kompany is said to have spoken with Diaz in a recent video call, where he outlined his plans for the 28-year-old in the Bundesliga. Diaz landed in Germany for a medical on Tuesday and is expected to be announced as Bayern's latest signing imminently.",
      "With 16 goals and eight assists to his name in the Premier League last season, Villa may be simply playing hard-ball to get a better price for their star striker who has three years remaining on his current deal. However, there is also genuine concern that Villa don't have enough depth up top to let Watkins leave, given that he is the only genuine No. 9 on Villa's books at present.",
      "Should Manchester United be unsuccessful in their endeavours to sign Watkins and take Villa's word as gospel, then they're not exactly short in terms of other options. The Red Devils are thought to be the front-runners in the race to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, despite Newcastle United also showing a heavy interest considering Alexander Isak's wishes to explore a move away from St James' Park.",
      "Leipzig reportedly value the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga last season, at around £60m. Meanwhile, it is reported that United have also explored deals for PSG's Randal Kolo Muani and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wrexham have been told to prioritise the pursuit of two former England stars over Christian Eriksen. It was revealed last week that the Welsh side had made a sensational approach for the Danish midfielder following his departure from Manchester United.",
      "The 33-year-old is currently a free agent after leaving the Premier League giants in May. Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoots told the Daily Mail that Wrexham – owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney – was a \"hugely impressive project\".",
      "However, the ex-Tottenham and Ajax player rejected the newly-promoted Championship outfit's advances. It came after Eriksen was said to have expressed his eagerness to remain at the top level for as long as possible.",
      "Former Blackburn striker Matt Jansen has now encouraged the Red Dragons to chase either Leicester legend Jamie Vardy or ex-Newcastle forward Callum Wilson instead. Jansen, who also had a short spell at Wrexham towards the end of his career, said the duo would be better options for his old club as manager Phil Parkinson looks to bolster his squad.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, he said: \"I think all the way through the spine of the team, they need to strengthen. Then it's a case of having a good run. If they have that, with confidence and belief, it would push them to the top of the table.",
      "\"I would say they have a good four or five players to get, top class players, proven goalscorers, to get to the top level of the Championship.",
      "\"Most importantly for them is a goalscorer and you'd be looking at the likes of a Jamie Vardy or a Callum Wilson, free agents at the moment. I think they would both be a better signing than Eriksen.\"",
      "Parkinson has admitted this week that Wrexham did try and sign Eriksen early in the summer transfer window. But he said the talks did not extend further than an initial conversation.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" Parkinson told BBC Sport Wales on Monday. \"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Wrexham have made six new signings so far this summer, including striker Ryan Hardie, goalkeeper Danny Ward, defender Liberato Cacace, midfielders George Thomason and Lewis O'Brien and forward Josh Windass.",
      "The club is preparing for its first season in the second tier in 43 years and Parkinson said he was aiming to make further additions before their opening game at Southampton on August 9.",
      "He added: \"We've been linked with so many players and if we'd been speaking to every player we've been linked with, I don't think we'd have had an hour to sleep over the last month. Some are true, some aren't.",
      "\"But we're just going about our business and trying to get a squad which can represent the club in this division this season.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",

      "New Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has already approved their move for Ollie Watkins - who could be the Red Devils' own Mo Salah. Watkins, 29, played alongside Mbeumo for then-Championship side Brentford in the 2019-20 season.",
      "Aston Villa privately insist Watkins isn't for sale at any price but United believe that a deal could be done for between £40million and £45m. That'd be considerably less than the £71m which Ruben Amorim's side agreed to pay Brentford for Mbeumo earlier this month.",
      "\"Said would be Roberto Firmino, very attacking, a good finisher,\" Mbeumo explained. \"I think it would be hard to say who is who among Mo Salah and Sadio Mane but I would probably be Mane and Ollie would be Salah.\"",
      "Watkins was flattered by the comparisons, saying: \"They are unbelievable, some of the best in the world and it's nice to always be compared to players of that stature. But I feel like we are compared to any front three that score a lot of goals. \"",
      "That summer, Brentford sold Watkins to Villa in a deal worth up to £33m and he's gone on to score 87 goals across five seasons. The England international's proven track record in the Premier League has seen him rise to the top of United's shortlist.",
      "The Red Devils have alternatives, though, including Benjamin Sesko and Randal Kolo Muani. Sales will be important in getting a deal done for any striker, with United still yet to get rid of the majority of Amorim's five-man 'bomb squad' who haven't travelled on their pre-season tour of the USA.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy while Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia remain at the club.

Ruben Amorim will be pleased with his side's first outing of the tour and will be looking to build on that display against Bournemouth.",

United's first-choice back three is still undecided, but there's every chance it could be Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven. The trio have never played as a back three but they could start against the Cherries.",

Kobbie Mainoo could start alongside him after his excellent display last weekend, but a dilemma further up the pitch could mean Amorim drops Bruno Fernandes back into midfield to allow others a chance to stake their claim to be one of the two No.10s.",

      "Over the weekend, Antony's agent Junior Pedroso discussed his future and said: \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status. We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "Antony's return to Manchester United training was delayed at the beginning of July so he could explore a move away, and he was subsequently not included in the USA tour squad.",
      "The winger is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and must be sold for £32.8million for United to avoid making a PSR loss, which feels like a reasonable fee after his Real Betis loan.",
      "Antony was a disaster in a United shirt, but he looked like a different player for Betis last season, scoring nine goals and playing a key role as they reached the Conference League final.",
      "He found a new lease of life in Spain and is consequently a more attractive proposition this summer. Antony was on a downward spiral at United and has managed to arrest his slump.",
      "However, when analysing the market, there may be just a handful of options for Antony in Europe. The clubs that would love to sign Antony cannot afford £32.8m. And the clubs that could afford the fee - the elite sides in Europe - aren't interested in him.",
      "Most European football clubs are in a financial pickle. Betis want to sign Antony permanently, for example, but they would have to break their transfer record to do so.",
      "So it was not surprising to see Antony's agent confirm that his client would be open to a move to Saudi Arabia, a transfer market United have underutilised.",
      "Saudi Arabia are diversifying their economy to reduce their dependence on oil and sport has been targeted. The Saudis have pumped millions into boxing and Saudi Pro League clubs have spent well over £1billion on transfers over the last few years.",
      "There have been accusations of sportswashing, of course, but Premier League clubs have cashed in, selling players to Saudi teams for the type of transfer fees that European clubs can't match.",
      "Kalidou Koulibaly, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Fabinho and Aleksandar Mitrovic are just some of the names who have moved to the Kingdom in multi-million transfers from Premier League sides.",

      "Al-Hilal were prepared to make a huge offer to sign Bruno Fernandes this summer, but United wanted to keep the 30-year-old, who decided to continue in the Premier League.",
      "It's easier said than done, but United would ideally sell players to Saudi Arabia on their terms. Those opportunities are hard to come by, but Antony is the perfect candidate to ship out to the Kingdom for a decent fee.",
      "Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City have all benefited from the Saudi gravy train in the last few years, and it's about time United exported a player to that market for a multi-million fee.",
      "United have famously not been great sellers in the transfer market and that must change with Ineos in charge of football operations. Building relations with club chiefs in Saudi Arabia wouldn't be a bad place to start.",

      "Mbeumo will play in front of more than 70,000 at Old Trafford next month yet he is loath to tickle the ivories in the presence of others. \"The thing is, I don't really like to play in front of people,\" he admits.",
      "So you can play football in front of nearly 80,000 fans but can't play the piano for friends? \"It’s funny, but it’s so different. Even if I play in front of a couple of friends at home, I'm not exactly shaking but it’s ‘oh guys, this is kind of hard for me’.",
      "Mbeumo is holding court on the first floor of Manchester United's hotel in Chicago, the Waldorf Astoria. Wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, he is clutching a bottle of water that he takes regular sips from during the 13-minute interview.",
      "At the Chicago Fire's Endeavor Health Performance Center earlier that morning, Mbeumo felt the heat. The 25-year-old has been doing extra sprints in recent days, attacking with the ball and then embarking on a recovery sprint into his own third. He also worked up a sweat in the hour-long on-pitch post-match session at the MetLife on Saturday night.",

      "Mbeumo's fitness would be more advanced but for his £71million protracted transfer. He spoke to the managers from two other clubs (presumably Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur and Eddie Howe at Newcastle) but was set on United.",
      "\"Manchester is a big club. I think it’s a great opportunity and I chose the project,\" he explains. \"I think I'm someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project in Manchester and I wanted to be part of it.",
      "\"Of course, I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me. He (Amorim) said ‘we are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that's what we will try to do.",
      "\"I think it was a very friendly conversation and a constructive one. He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that.",
      "\"You want to play on the greatest stages in the world. And Old Trafford is one of them. So being able to play here every two weeks is just big.\"",
      "United were unhappy with Brentford's conduct during negotiations, accusing them of attempting to railroad Mbeumo into joining Spurs or Newcastle and to reduce his salary expectations. Brentford tell a different side to the story.",
      "Despite the posturing, the deal was always heading in the right direction even after Brentford rejected United's first two offers.",
      "\"I always trust my people around me,\" Mbeumo stresses. \"The transfer windows can be long, it can be short. So you have to be patient, and just try to keep thinking positively about things.",
      "\"I was obviously on my holidays, so I just wanted to think about resting mentally and physically and if it was going to happen, it was going to happen. I trust my people and I was convinced that it was going to happen.\"",
      "Mbeumo's role in Amorim's new XI has generated enough speculation to rival a transfer. He is a winger yet was the joint-fourth highest scorer in the Premier League last season, so one of the two playmaker roles could be his. He also refers to himself as a \"striker\".",
      "So where will he play? \"Not one specific position because I think now, in football, you have to be adaptable and be able to play in a few other positions than what you’d say is your best. But I think it's really good to gain experience.",
      "\"Obviously I’ve played as a winger mainly at Brentford but I don’t have one specific position where I feel I can do the best. But with Brentford I used to also play as a 10 in the pocket or even as a No 9. I can do all those positions.",
      "\"Of course, as a forward, as a striker, you always want to make an imprint in the game, helping people to score or scoring yourself. So I think this is something really important for me.\"",
      "Tallying 20 league goals for Brentford was a monumental achievement. Half that tally would be a respectable return for Mbeumo in his maiden season at United but he is refusing to rein in expectations.",
      "\"As a striker as well, for myself I always want to be better than I was yesterday,\" he says. \"I’m very demanding of myself and I always try to do the best. I don’t like to put limits on myself as well.\"",
      "Could he operate as the lone striker? \"Whatever position the gaffer wants to put me out, I will play there.\"",
      "A lone king, perhaps. As well as a pianist, Mbeumo is also a chess fanatic. \"Chess, even if it's not physical, there is a lot of thought. When you play football you have to think as well. Playing chess you can see some moves ahead because it is a strategy game. In football you have your strategy as well so you can link them together.\"",
      "How good is he? \"I’m not that crazy good. But if you know the rating, I'm like 800 on chess.com. Playing online is anonymous. I have a user name, you choose a nickname and just play against random people online. And I use my own chess board against them.",
      "\"There was a period where I was really, really into it. I was watching videos on YouTube doing training on the app. I think even for the brain, it's really, really good. And you can develop new skills.",
      "\"Obviously, you're doing football most of the time, every day, so you sometimes don't really have time to develop other skills. I like creativity and stuff.",
      "\"I watched The Queen’s Gambit (on Netflix). It was really good. I’ve not watched the Magnus Carlsen thing yet. Maybe I should. I’ve been told that Josh (Zirkzee) plays, so I might need to play against him and bring in the chess board.\"",
      "Mbeumo could have an audience for that, if not the piano-playing. He is still likely to play more fluently than Sanchez.",

      "Well-placed sources have suggested Watkins would be open to joining United, who want a new starting striker following the £133.5million investments to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted the club had specifically targeted Cunha and Mbeumo due to their Premier League nous. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have scored more league goals than Watkins in the past three campaigns.",

      "There are a number of reasons why Garnacho must leave this summer, not least the fact that he has requested his departure.",

      "That is according to Fabrizio Romano anyway.",
      "He understands that Garnacho is still a certainty to leave United this summer despite Amorim suggesting last week that those who have requested their exits are not automatically guaranteed to leave.",
      "Romano adds that Chelsea could move to bring the United man to Stamford Bridge later in this window.",
      "When his transfer back to the Premier League is reportedly planned for next summer, it is hard to say whether United should touch this deal or not.",
      "He will be at least 33 when he arrives back in England and on the face of it, that is not the sort of signing which Ineos would advocate.",
      "However, could Kane be like Robert Lewandowski who, at 36, managed to score 42 goals in all competitions last season for Barcelona.",

      "Having won the Bundesliga last season and scoring a respectable 85 goals in 96 appearances so far for the Bavarian club, Kane has his eyes set on a return to the Premier League.",
      "It is believed that following the World Cup in the US next summer, the 32-year-old could push for a move back to England with Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League goalscoring record in his sights.",
      "Currently, Kane is just 47 goals behind Shearer and realistically he would need to play another two seasons in the top flight to overcome the Newcastle legend's tally.",

      "\"Ethan Nwaneri could be another one, it’s interesting that other Arsenal players have been keen on United. What I would say on Nwaneri, I think there will be a bit more of a tug-of-war going on and more financial demands than with those two.\"",

      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season earlier this month and stripped him of his iconic No. 10 shirt. However, he now has his dream transfer to Barcelona after spending the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",

Collyer made his first appearance for United in the Community Shield against Manchester City last year, but has only been in the starting line-up three times since then.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders at the disposal of head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is anticipated that United's plan to arrange a loan move for Collyer will pave the way for a new midfield signing.",
      "Having joined the United academy from Brighton in 2022, Collyer signed a new contract last summer. However, he was sidelined for 28 matches due to three separate injuries last season, managing to make only 13 appearances.",

      "Two strikers remain on Manchester United's radar in the summer transfer window.",
      "Sources have indicated the search has been whittled down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, with the former United's preferred option.",
      "Watkins is a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. He has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England last summer at Euro 2024.",
      "Watkins and Sesko have very different profiles, so it will be fascinating to see which player is signed.",
      "Sesko has not played in the Premier League and there is no guarantee he could make the transition from RB Leipzig to United, which is another reason to lean towards Watkins.",
      "However, Sesko has established himself as one of the finest goalscoring prospects in Europe and his ceiling is high, while Watkins has already maximised his potential as he approaches his 30th birthday.",
      "Sesko could prove to be better value for money in the long term and RB Leipzig would allow him to leave for a bid in the region of £69million to £78m, which is a reasonable valuation.",
      "The 22-year-old could develop into a world-class forward and he's been on United's radar for a few years. His agent, Elvis Basanovic, even visited Carrington and Old Trafford during talks over a possible move in 2022.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago as he opted for a move to RB Leipzig, where has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances, but the player has earmarked this summer as a chance for a big move.",
      "There is a degree of risk involved with Sesko that does not come with Watkins. Would he adapt to the demands of the Premier League? Would he settle quickly in England? How many seasons would it take him to score consistently? These are the types of questions United decision-makers will be asking.",
      "Sesko's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga is similar to Watkins' in the Premier League, but the German top flight is not as competitive and he is still raw, which must be considered.",
      "United scored a measly 44 goals in the league last season and it's logical to sign a striker who is proven in the division. Watkins would be a relatively short-term fix, but he would be effective and Rasmus Hojlund would benefit from playing second fiddle to a forward with such nous.",
      "So, would Aston Villa be happy to sanction a move for Watkins? United sources concede a sizeable bid would be required, but reports in the Midlands have claimed Watkins is not for sale. Who would lead their attack if Watkins was sold? Villa opted against signing Marcus Rashford permanently and Jhon Duran was sold to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr in the winter transfer window.",
      "It would be a bold move to sell two goalscoring strikers in successive transfer windows.",
      "Villa are now one of United's rivals due to the good work of Unai Emery. The Spaniard has established Villa as European challengers and would not want to strengthen a competitor.",
      "Emery's side would probably be better off sticking with what they have this summer, which raises the possibility of United leaning towards Sesko.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",

      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",

      "Manchester United are currently on their pre-season tour of the US but they will continue to be keeping a close eye on the summer transfer market.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo are the only senior players to have been added to the Reds squad this close season. There were question marks as to whether Leon would be integrated in the senior squad after his first move to European football but the full-back has excelled in training and youngster Harry Amass will instead be loaned out.",
      "Despite the deals done already, United will be keen to add further strength to their squad this summer. As such, MEN Sport has continued its daily look at some of the top rumours surrounding the club.",
      "Writing in his GiveMeSport column, journalist Fabrizio Romano has shed light on the rumours linking United with a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma. According to him, the Reds have not made any contact with the Italian at this stage.",
      "However, Romano understands that United do want a new goalkeeper but the 'numbers' need to be right.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is currently no set budget available for a new first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford which perhaps explains the lack of concrete interest from United for Donnarumma. Reports that United are not willing to pay £40m for Emi Martinez perhaps show evidence of a more sensible approach to transfer business. All this does make you wonder why United are not looking at bringing Aaron Ramsdale in on loan to provide good competition for Andre Onana.",
      "While this would not be a transfer for 2025, The Telegraph claims that Harry Kane is eyeing a return to the Premier League in 2026. United were interested in him back in 2023 when he moved to Bayern Munich but could not negotiate a deal with Tottenham.",
      "Kane is most likely eyeing Alan Shearer's record of 260 Premier League goals and a move closer to family as he turns 33 next year. It remains to be seen if United return to their interest in the striker.",
      "What MEN Sport says: On the surface, this is a signing that Ineos would not want any part of. An ageing player with no re-sale value.",
      "But, a player who Kane is often compared to is Robert Lewandowski and the Pole is still going strong at the age of 36 in La Liga. On a three-year deal, could Kane continue his lethal goalscoring prowess?",
      "That remains to be seen. But there is no doubting that he remains one of the best lone strikers in the world and would suit Ruben Amorim's system perfectly.",

      "One year on since Mason Greenwood left Manchester United and the forward's stock is higher than it was in England.",
      "Greenwood was sold by United for £26.5million last summer after the club decided to move him on.",
      "After being suspended by United and returning to football with Getafe, Greenwood moved to France to join Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille. In his first season, the 23-year-old scored 22 goals and provided another six assists in 36 games to help Les Pocheens record a second-placed finish.",
      "With Champions League football coming to the Stade Velodrome this season, Greenwood will be offered the chance to showcase his ability on the biggest stage. However, with the transfer window open for another month, another transfer hasn't been ruled out yet.",
      "Links to Saudi Arabia have been ever-present throughout the window with Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Nassr all reportedly keen. A move hasn't yet gathered pace but the window in Saudi Arabia doesn't close until September 2.",
      "As a result of a 50% sell-on clause included in Greenwood's move to France, United will be keeping a close eye on the situation for the rest of the window. Any sort of potential profit made on the forward by Marseille will be United's and it could see the Reds stand to gain.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe have revealed that a 'source close' to the situation has claimed: \"Basically, if OM sells him for €50m (£43.2m), they will have brought for him for €50m (£43.2m) and will have recovered €25m (£21.6m).",
      "\"Given his performances, the strong interest shown by Saudi clubs this summer, and his age, it's a safe bet that Greenwood will leave for a hefty sum.\"",
      "According to football data site, Transfermarkt, Greenwood's market value is at its highest since he left United. Before he joined Marseille, his value had risen from an enormous drop-off during his suspension to over £20m.",
      "One year later and Greenwood is now estimated to be worth €40m (£34.6m), which is already above what United got for him 12 months ago. If he was to move on for that fee, United would receive a further £15m windfall.",
      "CIES Football Observatory values Greenwood slightly higher. Their highest estimated price for the 23-year-old is currently €57m (£49.3m) with their lowest being €49m (£42.3m), fees that would only work in United's favour.",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap, Manchester United have been chasing shadows in their pursuit of a striker this summer.",
      "Delap was identified as United's top striker target ahead of the summer transfer window. Following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship, Delap was available via a £30million release clause. Unfortunately for United, Chelsea won the race for his signature, signing him in time for the start of the Club World Cup.",
      "Although Delap did well for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals, signing him to spearhead United's attack after just one season as a Premier League regular would have been a huge risk, meaning it is somewhat bold to suggest missing out on him was a 'blow'.",
      "Nevertheless, missing out on him has delayed their striker search. The additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have bolstered their attack, but they are still missing the main piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres, who has now joined Arsenal, have been and gone, while reports linking them with Victor Osimhen have persisted for as long as one can remember. Exactly where United's striker search will end remains to be seen.",
      "However, according to widespread reports, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has made his way back onto United's radar. Former football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer in 2022.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, have entered discussions with Sesko's representatives.",
      "With Delap, Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, who was also on United's radar earlier this summer, having all been snapped up already this summer, United's options are dwindling.",
      "United acknowledge they need to recruit a high-end striker to beef up Ruben Amorim's attack, and Sesko is arguably one of the very few left on the market that could be attainable.",
      "It goes without saying Leipzig will want a hefty-sized fee for the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal at the Red Bull Arena. He joined Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and signed a contract extension in June last year.",
      "Two seasons into his career in Germany, the Slovenian has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances in Leipzig colours. He scored 21 times last term.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article; he is still fairly young and finding his feet. In all honesty, United should be targeting someone more established and with a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Nevertheless, Sesko is an option United are reportedly running the rule over once again. And when you remember who is leading their recruitment this summer, it should come as no surprise.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who joined United last year, has been empowered to oversee the club's recruitment network and is a key part of the football structure at Old Trafford. Prior to joining the Reds, Vivell had stints at Chelsea and Leipzig.",
      "After joining the Bundesliga club in August 2020, he became their technical director, meaning he was responsible for recruitment and scouting across all age groups. He had previously spent five years at Salzburg, so is well-versed in the Red Bull model.",
      "Having swapped Salzburg for Leipzig, Sesko followed in his footsteps in 2023, swapping Austria for Germany. Leipzig agreed a deal to sign him in 2022, but the deal did not come into effect until the following year.",
      "Vivell was responsible for Leipzig's recruitment at the point of signing Sesko, meaning he knows all about the striker. He will be advising United and giving them insight on what he could potentially bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Sales, of course, remain key to United's chances of being able to land a big-name striker, and Sesko will command a big fee, but Vivell could make all the difference if a transfer tug-of-war unfolds.",

      "Manchester United's next big decision is set to be which striker they will target to lead Ruben Amorim's attack - Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Well-placed sources believe Watkins would be open to joining United and therefore ending his association with Villa, whom he joined upon their promotion back to the Premier League in 2020 and has helped reach European competitions in the past two seasons.",
      "Sesko, on the other hand, has been a standout performer in a Leipzig team that struggled, particularly last season, as they missed out on European football. This has served to heighten transfer talk.",
      "With United desperate to get back to the top of English football it is a choice they simply must get correct, so who should they sign? If their individual statistics over the past two seasons were to be the decisive factor, it is a tight battle.",
      "Research by AceOdds.com, for sheer goalscoring volume, sees Watkins comes out on top. The Villa star has netted 44 times in 107 appearances compared to Sesko's 39 strikes in 87 appearances for Leipzig.",
      "However, judging their rate per 90 minutes it is actually the latter's return that is better, as Sesko scores 0.66 per 90 mins whereas Watkins' total only equates to 0.5. Where the Englishman can regain some honour is through assists, as he has mustered 27 for Unai Emery's side. Sesko on the other hand is a far weaker provider, only setting up eight goals.",
      "Per 90 minutes this works out as 0.31 for Watkins and 0.14 for Sesko. Therefore as a grand total Watkins finishes with 71 goal contributions in 107 appearances and Sesko ends with 47 from his 87 outings. The striker duo are barely separable as Watkins has 0.81 goal contributions per 90 minutes to Sesko's 0.8.",
      "Judged on basic attacking threat over the past two seasons, Watkins and Sesko are also strikingly similar as the former averages 2.8 shots per 90 minutes played whilst the latter averages 2.9.",
      "Marginally better for Sesko is his 23 percent shot conversion rate to Watkins' 18 percent. Watkins' expected goals per 90 minutes sits at 0.48, compared directly to Sesko in the same field with 0.5.",
      "Again, where Watkins breaks clear is through his team play. In 90 minutes he averages 1.2 chances created but Sesko is weaker, managing only 0.7.",
      "But by no means does this mean Sesko is not heavily involved in what his team craft. With 36.7 touches per 90 minutes, the trend suggests he tends to operate as part of a unit more than Watkins, whose average is 28.1.",
      "In turn, the Slovenian international manages more passes per 90 minutes at a rate of 20.8 to 15.3.",
      "So, there is little to separate the two strikers that United have their eye on as the new season creeps closer. Both are high-quality options, but do United want a better player as things stand in Watkins, or do they go for Sesko who could be the superior player in five years time?",

      "Manchester United have made contact with Eberechi Eze's representatives ahead of a potential move in the summer transfer window, it has been claimed. The 27-year-old has been subject to interest from Arsenal and Tottenham following another impressive season at Crystal Palace.",
      "In fact, Eze scored 14 goals and provided 11 assists in 43 appearances for Oliver Glasner's side in 2024/25. The England international netted the match-winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City and ended the Premier League campaign having struck five times in his final five appearances.",
      "It's no surprise that Eze has attracted interest from across the Premier League, with the former Queens Park Rangers man boasting a £68million release clause in his Palace contract. According to a report from Caught Offside, United have contacted Eze's agent to explore a potential move.",
      "United have strengthened in the final third this summer with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arriving through the Old Trafford doors. But after such a disappointing season, the Reds are expected to add more players to the squad, as well as offloading several first-team stars.",
      "While it's unclear how Eze would fit into United's XI after both Cunha and Mbeumo signed, he would get the seal of approval from one of the club's greatest-ever players.",
      "Back in June, United legend Scholes shared a photo of Eze, following England's 3-1 defeat against Senegal, on his Instagram story alongside the caption: \"Just buy him...\"",
      "Scholes hasn't been the only former player to urge United to make a move for the Palace star. Speaking in May, Dwight Yorke said: \"Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United.",
      "\"Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it's not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise - who went to Bayern - United should buy them for £100million. Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players.",
      "\"Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are. Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he's a good athlete, he can create and score. He's at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It's a no-brainer.\"",

      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders at the disposal of head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is anticipated that United's plan to arrange a loan move for Collyer will pave the way for a new midfield signing.",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron has confessed he regrets his transfer from Manchester United to Chelsea, blaming injuries for his struggles at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Few Premier League stars have made the leap from one major title contender to another, with a notable case being Carlos Tevez's controversial switch across Manchester to neighbours City. Veron represents one of those players who defected to a significant rival, when he departed United for Stamford Bridge in 2003 following just two seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-50-year old originally joined United for a British transfer record sum of £28.1million, netting 11 times in 82 outings and claiming one Premier League crown.",
      "Following his arrival, Sir Alex Ferguson declared: \"I never thought I'd spend this much money on a footballer. I think he's coming into great years of his career and he will peak and we'll get the benefit of that. He is a world-class, fantastic footballer with a vision of a game we can use.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Veron had just 24 months under Ferguson's stewardship before becoming one of Roman Abramovich's initial acquisitions as Chelsea's owner. He departed United for £15m, meaning the club sustained a loss of approximately £13m from their initial transfer outlay.",
      "When reflecting on his stint at Stamford Bridge in 2019, the Argentine revealed: \"At Chelsea, the reality is that I had very little time. I had a major back injury and I was out for practically six months. I was already thinking more about going back to Italy than staying there in England.\"",
      "The move to Chelsea proved to be one he'd come to rue, as he struggled for playing time at Stamford Bridge, managing just 14 appearances and netting only once. He was loaned out to Inter Milan and Club Estudiantes de La Plata before taking a sabbatical for a year and remaining at La Plata until hanging up his boots in 2017.",
      "Discussing his regret over the Chelsea transfer, Veron admitted: \"With United, the truth is that there are few things, very few, that I regret. But one is to have left Manchester. They never pushed me or told me 'you have to go', but they gave me the chance, the possibility.",
      "\"I had talks with my former colleagues at that time telling me that I had to stay. And at one moment I decided to leave because I wanted to play, because I didn't know... I should have stayed.\"",
      "Reports this summer have linked Chelsea with a move for current United winger Alejandro Garnacho. The Argentine is expected to leave Old Trafford in the current transfer window with the Blues one of the clubs showing an interest in his services.",
      "Fellow winger Jadon Sancho made the same move last summer, signing a loan deal with Chelsea. He made a total of 42 appearances last season, but like Veron, it was a move that didn't work out and the Blues opted against using the obligation to buy, instead paying a fee to send him back to United.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Garnacho will follow in Veron's footsteps, but his warning should be somethingthe Argentinian considers this summer.",

      "Manuel Ugarte is \"optimistic\" about a successful season at Manchester United amid the buoyant mood in the squad.",
      "Ugarte excelled in United's opening tour win against West Ham United in New Jersey on Saturday night in what is his first pre-season with the club.",
      "The 24-year-old joined United from Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day last August for a fee rising to £50.75million and Ugarte is set to have a pivotal role in head coach Ruben Amorim's side this season.",
      "Ugarte played under Amorim at Sporting and the Uruguay international has backed himself to improve on an underwhelming first campaign which ended with him being benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim omitted the five members of United's 'bomb squad' from the tour. Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all still at the club. Ugarte stressed togetherness is fundamental if United are to recover from their worst season in 51 years.",
      "\"Last year we made some changes, we changed our coach, we changed our formation,\" Ugarte said. \"We got to know the Premier League. This year I am good, I am very excited.",
      "\"It is important to perform well in this club, with United. You have to have responsibilities when you play for United. I am very happy and we have to keep going.",
      "\"Without a doubt, I know the rivals, I know the teammates, it is important. Sometimes the connections take time to get to know each other. I already know the league, the rivals, which is important. I am very happy, but we have to keep going.",
      "\"All three players (Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon) who came are very good, good people, good players. It is important that everyone is together in the dressing room and we have to keep going.",
      "\"We are very optimistic because we all work together. We try to be humble day by day, game by game. We will see this season.\"",
      "Ugarte admitted in May that he is copying Casemiro, nine years his senior, as the baton is passed on in the United midfield. Casemiro, 33, has entered the last year of his contract at the club.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte for the 2-1 victory over West Ham after the pair lined up together in central midfield only ten times last season. Ugarte is likely to play alongside Mainoo more often amid a lack of options in midfield.",
      "\"Obviously, I talk to Case every day,\" Ugarte added. \"I have a good relationship. About everything, football less, but we talk about everything, life, day to day things. I am very happy because I have a good relationship with him.",
      "\"Kobbie? Also English, he is a young player with a lot of talent. We also talk about younger things, compared to Casemiro, because Casemiro is older. But we all have a good relationship, there is a lot of optimism in the team.",
      "\"I have been talking to Bruno (Fernandes) since before, because he played for Sporting. I have a very good relationship with him. He is a good person and it is important for everyone, for the squad, because he is a great player.",
      "\"Without a doubt, we have to improve things, we have matches to prepare for. We are all very motivated, because we believe in the coach, we believe in what he wants and that is very important.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko could leave Alan Shearer red-faced as he weighs up a move to Manchester United.",
      "The RB Leipzig forward has been strongly linked with both the Red Devils and Newcastle United. Sesko, who carries a £64million price tag, looks Premier League-bound following Leipzig's failure to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "United will be completely shut out from European competition this season after losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final. Following that match, Shearer launched a scathing attack on Ruben Amorim and his squad, condemning their approach and the club's overall direction.",
      "The Newcastle legend was convinced United would find it impossible to lure elite talent without the attraction of Champions League participation. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, he said: \"They're going to have to recruit very well because clearly a lot of these players are not good enough or not suited to that style of play.",
      "\"They're a million miles off it on and off the pitch and I don't know how they get out of this. How do they attract top players this summer and are they even going to be able to pay for them now they're not in the Champions League? Why would big players want to go there?\"",
      "However, it seems Sesko has not been put off by United's lack of European football amid reports he is favouring a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle, who have qualified for UEFA's top club competition.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, Sesko has reacted positively to United's interest. Amorim has already strengthened his forward line this summer with moves for Bryan Mbeumo – who also picked them over a club playing in the Champions League, having had his former manager Thomas Frank interested in taking him to Tottenham – and Matheus Cunha, but the United boss still wants to add more firepower to his squad.",
      "Newcastle remain in contention for the 22-year-old Sesko's signature. The Magpies' need for a quality striker has become more urgent after Alexander Isak made it clear he is open to leaving amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Meanwhile, with United looking to offload players as well as add new recruits, Amorim has warned that wantaway stars won't be allowed to leave on the cheap. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were left out of the tour of the United States and have been training at Carrington instead.",
      "United’s recent transfer dealings have been widely criticised but Amorim said chief executive Omar Berrada and sporting director Jason Wilcox would not be taken advantage of just to get rid of those surplus to requirements.",
      "“I know for a fact that these people, Omar and Jason, and the club have a number (price) for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that,” said the United boss.",
      "“I understand clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise and I’m ready. I’m ready to receive the players.”",

      "Benjamin Sesko was once hailed as a better player than Manchester City star Erling Haaland by a coach who has worked with both players.",
      "United's hunt for a striker looks to have taken them to Red Bull Leipzig's talismanic forward, Sesko, though Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins also remains an option. The 22-year-old has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Red Bull Leipzig and has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs, with United now seriously considering a swoop for the player.",
      "Ex-Red Bull Salzburg coach Rene Aufhauser once believed that the towering striker had even more in his locker than Haaland had. Haaland, 25, played for Salzburg for one season between 2019 and 2020, while Sesko lined up for the Austrians from 2020-2023.",
      "\"Benjamin is maybe the better football player, better to play with the team, technically maybe better at the same age,\" Rene Aufhauser told The Mail in 2022, when Sesko was just 19. \"His natural movements are so good, he's 6ft 4in tall, fast and has very, very good physical ability.",
      "\"He's so smooth with the ball, very good technique, good finishing and he jumps so high. Very, very, good with the head. It's unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Erling [Haaland] was mentally a monster and (mentally) better at the same age,\" Aufhauser added. \"This is the last five, 10 per cent that Benji has to get.\"",
      "While Sesko is younger, it's true that by 22 - the Slovenian's current age - Haaland had already scored his big-money move to City, where he won the Premier League in his maiden season with the Citizens. He has consistently been the league's most feared frontman since teaming up with Pep Guardiola, winning two top-flight titles and the Champions League.",
      "However, Sesko was involved in 18 goal contributions for Leipzig last season as the club struggled in the Bundesliga, ultimately missing out on the Champions League.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is now believed to have pivoted to the player, while still keeping an eye on Aston Villa's Watkins. Newcastle United are also firmly in the hunt for Sesko, too, with the Magpies looking for a striker to replace Alexander Isak should he leave amid heavy links to Liverpool.",
      "Sesko actually rejected United three years ago in favour of joining Leipzig but is now keen to secure a major move this summer. The Slovenian is under contract at Leipzig until 2029, but his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue since United's first inquiry and even visited their Carrington training complex.",
      "If United make a move for Sesko, does he have what it takes to make the grade in the Premier League? Aufhauser was of the opinion that the three-time Slovenian Youth Footballer of the Year had some way to go before becoming the finished article.",
      "\"He needs experience at this level and also maybe to learn to handle and deal with disappointment,\" he said in 2022. \"Sometimes he wants to be perfect. He has to stay cool, stay calm and to wait for his next chance. This is maybe the biggest thing he has to learn.\"",
      "However, three years on, with three Austrian Bundesliga titles to his name and a goalscoring record to put several of Europe's leading strikers to shame, it looks as though Sesko could finally be ready to make the jump to United - and even rival Haaland as one of England's most formidable strikers.",

    "body": [
      "Ruben Amorim has been on Kobbie Mainoo’s case to increase his “rhythm and pace”. Mainoo was quick to intercept Alphonse Areola’s pass to assist Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes caressed the ball as nonchalantly as David Beckham to put United 2-0 up against West Ham. He could have purely milked the acclaim yet made a beeline for Mainoo.",
      "This was the second time Mainoo walked off the MetLife Stadium pitch to murmurs of approval. As an 18-year-old two years ago, he outshone an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. Erik ten Hag did not attend a post-match press conference but paused in the mixed zone to wax lyrical about Mainoo to us journalists.",
      "It was apparent that Ten Hag was preparing Mainoo not for the first team squad but the first team. Cruelly, 80 seconds into the friendly with Real Madrid in Houston the following week, Casemiro fouled Rodrygo, who collided into Mainoo’s ankle and he was sidelined for four months.",
      "Back in the United States for his second pre-season tour, Mainoo’s challenge is to regain his place rather than gain it. It augurs well that Amorim not only picked him from the start against West Ham but played Mainoo in midfield, his natural habitat.",
      "Mainoo has occupied three different roles in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system but it is in his and the team’s interests that he returns to midfield. United have a surfeit of possible No.10s - Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee. They have a shortage of out-and-out central midfielders and Mainoo is one of four.",
      "“I liked Kobbie Mainoo’s game,” Amorim enthused at the MetLife. That was unprompted. He was especially pleased with how Mainoo and the domineering Manuel Ugarte upped the intensity after the drab draw with Leeds United seven days earlier. Both started on the bench in Sweden.",
      "Amorim lamented “the lack of pace” in midfield against Leeds. He picked Fernandes and Casemiro, players with a combined age of 63. That rotational team in Stockholm seemed to be solely about fitness. In New Jersey, United’s starting XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there,\" Amorim explained. \"Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.\"",
      "\"I like the mentality of us today,\" Matthijs de Ligt added. \"High pressing, a lot of intensity.\" Mainoo and Ugarte underpinned that.",
      "Of the outfield players, Mainoo was maybe the least assured of keeping his place. Bryan Mbeumo could muscle his way in, though he will not play until the third tour match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. United only have one more friendly - at home to Fiorentina on August 9 - before Arsenal board their train to Manchester Piccadilly.",
      "2024-25 was not a season teeming with highlights for Mainoo but he excelled at Arsenal in the spirited FA Cup third round triumph. Arsenal will likely have Rice and Rodri’s heir, Martin Zubimendi, to pit against United’s midfield axis.",
      "Amorim leaned on Casemiro in the final months of last season, predominantly in the Europa League. Mainoo and Ugarte are better equipped to compete with Rice, Zubimendi and Fernandes’ opposite number, Martin Odegaard.",
      "It has gone quiet on the new contract front for Mainoo. He last scrawled his signature on United papers in February 2023 when he was still a teenager and had made two appearances. The deal was highly incentivised but his profile has expanded vastly since, so much so that Nike made a song-and-dance about his renewal last year, arranging for Mainoo to play in a five-a-side game at Venice Beach. United have to remunerate him.",
      "As much of a wrench as it would be for members of the academy to see Alejandro Garnacho depart after five years, Garnacho hails from Madrid, not Manchester. His arrogance was so apparent in the academy that it was inevitable he would not be a one-club man and one day angle for a return to the land of his birth.",
      "It is different with Mainoo. He is a Mancunian and a boyhood United fan. The era of the one-club is in danger of ending and United is the club that has to rail against that.",
      "It is not pure sentiment to safeguard Mainoo’s future. He was integral to United’s FA Youth Cup and FA Cup successes, two of their highlights this decade. His winner at Wembley is one of the great Cup final goals. Mainoo left Wembley that day looking like a schoolboy on a field trip, with his shirt tucked out and a bucket hat resting on his noggin.",
      "He didn’t stand still. Weeks later, Mainoo transformed England’s midfield in their run to the European Championship final. He would enhance most midfields.",
      "Some supporters will be nervous about Mainoo’s sellable asset status. Midfield is also an area where United want to strengthen, once they have made room. Selling Mainoo is a prospect they cannot entertain and, as insignificant as pre-season matches are, Mainoo’s selection against West Ham was somewhat significant.",
      "Whenever Mainoo started in the second half of last season, it was in domestic matches between European ties. Amorim is evidently willing to compromise now, bringing Mainoo back into the midfield fold, and there is not as much noise around him as there was with Scott McTominay last year. Fulham had submitted two offers for McTominay by late July 2024.",
      "Two years ago, Mainoo’s sudden prominence made United receptive to selling McTominay. The plans changed when Rodrygo ploughed into Mainoo’s ankle. Hopefully, he avoids such misfortune in Chicago.",
      "Then he can continue to perfect his rhythm.",

      "Antony has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in recent days after a fruitful six-month loan at Real Betis.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined United from Ajax for around £85million in August 2022 and has failed to live up to the hefty price tag. However, his form during the second half of last season has raised the player’s value ahead of a summer sale.",
      "Betis want to keep Antony but are struggling to match the 25-year-old’s wage demands. He currently earns £105,000 a week at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have so far failed in their attempts to shift all of their unwanted high earners, with the exception of new Barcelona loan signing Marcus Rashford.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all surplus to requirements, with Ruben Amorim eager to move them on and reinvest in new signings.",
      "The club have signed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for a combined £127.5m but Amorim wants a new centre-forward, and potentially a midfielder and goalkeeper — though the latter is contingent on Andre Onana leaving.",
      "It was reported by Foot Mercato on Monday that Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr — captained by United legend Cristiano Ronaldo — have made an opening offer for Antony.",
      "Meanwhile, a fresh report from Antenados states that Antony has ‘rejected’ offers from Brazilian clubs Sao Paulo and Botafogo.",
      "Indeed, the former Ajax forward has ‘ruled out’ a return to his homeland in the summer transfer window.",
      "It’s confirmed that Antony ‘is not in United’s plans next season’ but Sao Paulo ‘demonstrating interest’ will not sway him, with the Serie A side receiving a ‘negative result’.",
      "It’s added that clubs in the Middle East are interested but there’s no mention of the aforementioned Al Nassr ‘offer’.",
      "Another player who could leave United this summer is Rasmus Hojlund, who is not a part of Amorim’s bomb squad alongside Antony, Sancho, Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Hojlund joined the Premier League giants from Atalanta in the 2023 summer window and has been strongly linked with a return to the Italian Serie A in recent months.",
      "According to Italian outlet Calciomercato, Hojlund’s former Atalanta head coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, is keen on reuniting at AS Roma, who the veteran boss took charge of at the end of 2024/25.",
      "The report claims that Artem Dovbyk’s uncertain future could open the door for the arrival of the 22-year-old Danish international.",
      "Calciomercato states:",
      "In the event of a Dovbyk transfer, Roma would attempt to bring Rasmus Hojlund back to Italy. The 2003-born Danish striker has a contract with Manchester United until June 2028 (plus an option for another season) worth €3 million net per year.",
      "His name had also been linked on the market with other Italian clubs such as Inter (before the explosion of Pio Esposito, the arrival of Bonny from Parma and the negotiations for Lookman from Atalanta), Napoli (before the arrival of Lucca from Udinese), Juventus (as an alternative to Kolo Muani and Darwin Nunez) and Milan (as an alternative to Vlahovic).",
      "Hojlund has only scored 26 goals in 95 matches for United, while Antony has only recorded 17 goal involvements in 96 appearances.",

      "20) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Jackson is off Man Utd’s list because of the anticipated costs involved. Which Chelsea won’t compromise on if they know Newcastle have an Isak-sized windfall on the way.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Juventus\nThe Old Lady are the latest to throw their hat in the ring for Nunez, who was previously a target for Napoli. Liverpool have been keen to sell the Uruguayan striker for a while, but they are even more eager now that Alexander Isak is available…",

      "16) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Borussia Dortmund\nThe Gunners man is on Dortmund’s list of winger targets, with Jadon Sancho also under consideration. Arsenal could reinvest some of the money into Rodrygo, which means their supporters are bang up for this.",
      "",
      "15) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "14) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "13) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "12) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one has picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. We could see this happening, but not quickly.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "10) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But now here come Man Utd. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nThis rumour is a re-entry into the top 20 amid reports Sesko is one of two names on United’s striker shortlist. The Red Devils could be helped by talk of a gentleman’s agreement between Leipzig and Sesko that he could go for £60million to one of a select few clubs, which United are among. But Newcastle are not. And one suspects Leipzig might change their tune when Newcastle are trying to throw at them whatever Isak money there might be. For United’s sake, we hope Sesko got something in writing.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "",
      "4)  Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Some reports suggest a deal has already been done. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who looks set for a switch to St James’ Park, where he shouldn’t experience another relegation.",
      "",
      "2) Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked to be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, is already in Wearside for a medical.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nThe Colombian is now in Bavaria to undergo a medical after a fee of £65million was agreed. There’s half the Isak money…"

      "Manchester United have whittled down their striker shortlist to two: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko. Tell us who they should they sign…",
      "United have spent around £133million on adding some creativity to their attack but still they lack a top-class centre-forward.",
      "They have been linked with a variety of names through the summer, including Viktor Gyokeres and Dusan Vlahovic, but reports suggest there are only two names on their wishlist.",
      "One is Ollie Watkins. The Aston Villa forward is seen as proven Premier League quality and he is likely to be the cheaper of the two options.",
      "Arsenal were quoted £60million when they enquired over Watkins in January, but United reportedly believe there is a deal to be done at around £45million.",
      "The cheapest price for which they might get Benjamin Sesko out of RB Leipzig is around £60million. That is said to be the agreement between the Bundesliga club and the giant striker if a select few clubs of Sesko’s choosing make a move. United are said to be among them.",
      "Did Sesko get that agreement in writing? Because with Newcastle seemingly eyeing the Slovenian as a possible replacement for Alexander Isak, Leipzig are almost certain to do what they can to get closer to what they feel is their striker’s real value – around £75million.",
      "𝗢𝗟𝗟𝗜𝗘 𝗪𝗔𝗧𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗦 𝘃 𝗕𝗘𝗡𝗝𝗔𝗠𝗜𝗡 𝗦𝗘𝗦𝗞𝗢",
      "Watkins is 30 in December and United reckon he might cost £45million.",

      "— Football365 (@F365) July 29, 2025",
      "Watkins is older but cheaper and proven in the Premier League, while Sesko is pricier with greater longevity and potential. So which striker should United move for?",
      "Of course it might all be irrelevant if United cannot raise the funds for either.",
      "It seems they must sell to buy and though Marcus Rashford is out from under Ruben Amorim’s feet – for this season at least – there are still four members of the ‘bomb squad’ to park elsewhere.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s price continues to fall, with United looking for £15million to £17million. Juventus and, once again, Dortmund are interested, but both would be wise to sit tight and wait for United to get even more desperate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was seen as the most sellable asset but, again, there is no bidding war. Perhaps there is a way to use Villa’s interest in the winger to grease the wheels of a deal for Watkins but reports suggest Garnacho is content to sit tight until the end of the window when his options could be increased by United’s eagerness to be rid.",
      "The Saudi interest in Antony could do United a huge favour, especially since Real Betis have strung the Red Devils along all summer with seemingly no intention of paying a fee for the Brazilian.",
      "Then there’s Tyrell Malacia, who seems to have disappeared from everyone’s radar.",

      "Having spent around £130m on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon this summer, it has been reported that Man Utd‘s next priority is to sign a striker after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee underperformed last season.",
      "With United struggling to offload their unwanted talents, their funds are limited and they have already missed out on several targets, including Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "This has made the Red Devils turn to alternatives and it has emerged that Watkins and Sesko are currently their ‘preferred’ striker targets.",
      "22-year-old Sesko has a longer shelf life than 29-year-old Watkins, but he is also more expensive as the RB Leipzig star is reportedly valued at 80 million euros (£69m). The Villa star, meanwhile, could potentially cost anything between £45-60m.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour ranking: Sesko to Man Utd a re-entry; Liverpool, City, Chelsea deals close",
      "Ferdinand is in favour of Man Utd signing Watkins over Sesko as he is more of a “guarantee”, while he has a “worry” about the younger forward.",
      "“If you get Watkins, you’ve got guaranteed 15-20 goals really and then you’ve got that with Cunha and you’ve got that with Mbeumo,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Not completely guaranteed, but you’ve got double figures all the way up front.",
      "“Bear in mind, we were 16th in terms of goals scored last season and these lot are getting you minimum 40 goals between them.”",
      "Regarding his “worry” about Sesko, Ferdinand continued: “The only difference is that Rasmus came in and had inexperience around him in terms of [Alejandro] Garnacho one side and Amad [Diallo] the other, for instance, most of the time.",
      "“If Sesko comes in, he’s got two players that have played Premier League, scored goals in the Premier League and backed up by Bruno [Fernandes] so I think it’s a different dynamic that he comes into.",
      "“But the uncertainty worries me a little bit. Can he adapt to this league?”",
      "Ferdinand added: “I wanted a striker with experience so he wouldn’t be my first-choice, obviously, even now.",
      "“But if Manchester United buy him and Newcastle go and get a number nine, does that mean [Alexander] Isak stays at Newcastle and Liverpool don’t get Isak?",

      "“In the last decade and in this period, we couldn’t always get the players we wanted,” Erik ten Hag told Gary Neville last May. “Then you have to build and you have to accept that you get talent in instead of players who have already proved it in the past.",
      "“We have had some choices made with talents like Rasmus Hojlund,” he continued. “I can see a striker who already proved it, who we wanted to sign and we couldn’t get him. And then we went to Rasmus because he’s a talent.",
      "“With Harry Kane you know you get 30 goals. I think Rasmus will get there but he needs time. It’s not fair to assess him the same as Harry Kane. I would never compare two players because they are very different.”",
      "One year, a managerial change and sporting director departure later, Manchester United are back comparing “very different” strikers in terms of profile and style again.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could the ‘narrowing’ of a transfer shortlist produce two targets at opposing ends of the broad centre-forward spectrum.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could that development be briefed to the usual cabal of journalists like an underachieving child proudly showing their working-out for a sum they will inevitably get wrong.",
      "Only at Old Trafford could history repeat itself in such a peculiar way.",
      "In the claret and blue corner, the proven Premier League experience of a seasoned England international about to enter his 30s. In the Red Bull corner, the pure promise of a prodigious centre-forward who has never played in the Premier League by his early 20s.",
      "And those are just the surface-level differences between the players Manchester United are choosing from to lead the line in this brave attacking restructure under Ruben Amorim.",

      "Watkins is a defence-stretching runner whose touches almost exclusively come within the confines of the penalty area and are reflected in his goal and assist output; Sesko drops deep to engage heavily in the build-up, dribbling and passing while generally taking his shots from much further away.",
      "Yet only now, with August looming and Manchester United on their pre-season tour, are they ‘in the process of weighing up Watkins and Sesko for their contrasting styles, suitability to Ruben Amorim’s team, and financial outlay’.",
      "That was one of the lines used by one of the writers blessed enough to be given access to Manchester United’s grand recruitment operation and it exposes the absurdity of a search which essentially amounts to consulting a formerly good website for their ideas on the best feasibly attainable strikers this summer, without an actual thought as to where and how they would fit for them specifically as a club.",
      "But at least Manchester United had the self-awareness to rule out a move for Alexander Isak. Once his name and that of Nicolas Jackson was scribbled out along with that of Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap earlier in the summer, this bizarre battle between Watkins and Sesko became inevitable as the two strikers left standing with no similarities beyond their position.",
      "It is not quite the same scenario the club faced with Hojlund and Kane in 2023. There was a chasm between those two players and it was reflected in the cost required to complete either deal. Manchester United also did well to rule out the latter early – then obviously dragged their heels over the former to the extent he was signed a week before the season started.",
      "Watkins is a slightly younger – although still of a Ratcliffe rule-breaking age – and far less prolific Kane counterpart two years on, while Sesko is older and further ahead in his evolution than Hojlund was and probably ever will be.",
      "There will be debates over resale value, high ceilings, acclimatisation periods, risk and experience versus potential.",
      "It is a difficult choice but also not one a club with any degree of competence would leave itself to make. If Manchester United have whittled their possible answers down to either Watkins or Sesko, they have forgotten the question and just started naming strikers they know.",
      "Newcastle are set to use the money from Alexander Isak’s potential sale to Liverpool to buy two new strikers, according to reports.",

      "“He needs to have a different start somewhere else, because he’s obviously a decent goalkeeper.”",
      "Sheringham insists that Man Utd must sell players, whatever the cost this summer, he added: “It’s very easy to spend money on players, but it’s hard to recoup it. It seems quiet, but I bet there’s lots going on behind the scenes at Manchester United. Other clubs know United’s position.",
      "“They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers. I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment.",
      "“The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it. They’ll probably take anything from a quarter to a fifth of their asking price for some of them.”",
      "Newcastle are set to use the money from Alexander Isak’s potential sale to Liverpool to buy two new strikers, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have whittled down their striker shortlist to two: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko. Tell us who they should they sign…",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has revealed who he would prefer his former club to sign out of Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Manchester United want everyone to know their striker transfer shortlist is down to Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko, even if it makes them look stupid.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘confident’ of signing RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko for one key reason amid interest from Newcastle United.",
      "A diabolical transfer window for Newcastle will get worse when they miss out on Benjamin Sesko and Yoane Wissa before signing a Liverpool player for £50m."

      "While Manchester United scour Europe for someone, anyone willing to pay anything for their unwanted cast of very talented footballers they’ve decided they have no use for, other Premier League teams have shown themselves to be adept at selling players to balance their books and boost their summer spending sprees, with Chelsea proving to be the masters.",
      "The Blues have four player sales in this top 10, which includes transfers which have been agreed but not yet signed and sealed.",
      "",
      "10) Bashir Humphreys: Chelsea to Burnley, £10m\nThat’s £10m of pure profit for a left-back with a market value of £6m, who made two appearances for Chelsea and was never going to make another one.",
      "The cash has been immediately spent on teenage centre-back Mamadou Sarr, who started 27 games to help Strasbourg into the Conference League last season. As becomes clearer as you go down this page, Chelsea remain experts in filling their coffers.",
      "",
      "9) Djordje Petrovic: Chelsea to Bournemouth, £22m rising to £25m\nWe’re entirely ready to accept that Chelsea may have sold their best goalkeeper. That may be Petrovic, it may be Kepa Arrizabalaga. But for us they’re all equally sh*t, average and alright, depending on what mood we’re in, so they may as well make a £10m PSR-boosting profit on Petrovic and have Robert Sanchez feebly tending goal again with the identically inadequate Filip Jorgensen in reserve if they’re really actually not going to sign a decent option to match the progression of the rest of the squad.",
      "",
      "8) Lloyd Kelly: Newcastle to Juventus, £14.5m rising to £20m\nWe’re pleased for Kelly, who probably thought – as we did – that he would play more for Newcastle having made what looked like a decent move for both player and club last summer.",
      "But after starting three of the opening five games following his free transfer, Kelly featured for just 96 minutes in the next 19 games before sealing a loan exit to Juventus.",
      "And the key part he played for the Old Lady – nailing down a spot at the heart of their defence – suggests Newcastle may come to regret the obligation to buy that was enforced when a limited appearance-based condition was met. But without knowing the heights Kelly will reach in Serie A and beyond, Newcastle will currently be seeing this as a huge PSR win.",
      "",
      "7) Yan Couto: Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund, £21m rising to £25m\nCouto joins a list of 12 players, including Pedro Porro, Aaron Mooy, Jason Denayer, Jack Harrison and Douglas Luiz, that City have sold for a combined £113m having never made an appearance for club. Incredible.",
      "Maximo Peronne was also sold this summer, to Como for £11.2m, having featured for just 20 minutes in a City shirt.",
      "",
      "6) Anthony Elanga: Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, £52m rising to £55m\nNo other team in world football is paying that fee for Elanga. That definitely doesn’t mean it was wrong for Newcastle to pay it, before all of this Alexander Isak heartache it was the one area of the pitch where there was the biggest potential for improvement and he’s a very Eddie Howe player – direct, powerful and speedy.",
      "But Forest must have been a tad surprised when Newcastle returned with an extra £10m after seeing their initial £45m bid knocked back for the Swede. He’s valued at £36m and cost them under £20m.",
      "A penny for the thoughts of the Manchester United chief who opened the door to that sale to Forest in the summer of 2023 due to ‘reservations over Elanga’s ability to break down stubborn defences in a United team that had expectations to dominate possession during games’ before sacking that manager and hiring one whose modus operandi is dynamism in transition.",
      "Now we think about it, United are the second team in world football who would have paid that fee for Elanga had that move not required a hilarious and embarrassing climbdown.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford to Manchester United, £65m rising to £71m\nThere was a time when mid-table Premier League sides were bullied into letting their prized assets leave for Manchester United. As soon as they came calling, that was that, with a club the size of Brentford expected to kiss rings and bow in appreciation of the Red Devils bestowing such honour on them by being interested in one of their players.",
      "Not for the first time, nor we suspect the last, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Ineos lads played their hand way too early. Brentford weren’t happy that they approached Mbeumo first, and when the forward then made it clear he only wanted the move to Old Trafford despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, the Red Devils created a situation for themselves where they either had to meet Brentford’s demand – which didn’t change despite contrary reports pushed by United – or flounce away from their top target to the great enjoyment of the masses who feed on evidence that a once-great club is great no longer.",
      "They opted save face and were indeed ‘held to ransom’ despite Ratcliffe’s insistence that he wouldn’t be, paying some £18m over Mbeumo’s market value.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke: Chelsea to Arsenal, £48.5m rising to £50m\nIn our latest instalment of Both Things Can Be True, we see this as a good signing from Arsenal but also a very good sale by Chelsea. The Gunners wanted an option for both left and right wings, whose first thought is to take defenders on, at a good age with a high ceiling; Madueke is all those things.",
      "And while the logic in coaching a player, watching them improve and then selling them before seeing whether they can fulfil their potential in favour of someone at the onset of what will likely be a very similar journey in Jamie Gittens is at best questionable and at worst a sign that Chelsea as a football club aren’t actually all that interested in developing young talent but buying and selling them until they uncover ready-made gems, on the face of it they have made close to £20m on a forward who got 20 goals and nine assists in 92 appearances for them.",
      "",
      "3) Luis Diaz: Liverpool to Bayern Munich, £65.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox should take note. Weirdly, the best way to get the most amount of money for a footballer who wants to leave and you don’t particularly want at your football club for at least that reason and possibly others, isn’t to drop them to a bomb squad and announce to the world that you’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "The party line from Liverpool and Arne Slot for the majority of this transfer window, amid interest from Barcelona, Saudi Arabia and Bayen, was that they had ‘no plans’ to sell Diaz.",
      "They also had no plan to offer him an improved contract, and will therefore have known that Diaz would likely push for an exit. But he went on tour with Slot and his teammates, at least providing interested clubs with the illusion of a possible harmonious future at the club if they fail to up the ante.",
      "And Bayern did. After the Premier League champions rejected an opening bid of £58.6m from the Bundesliga giants, they’ve now accepted a £65.5m bid including add-ons, or 44% of an Alexander Isak, for a 28-year-old valued by Transfermarkt at £60m.",
      "",
      "2) Jarell Quansah: Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m rising to £35m\nWe have no way of finding this out/didn’t even try, but we posit that there has never been a greater transfer-fee-per-senior-start paid (yes, it’s a thing if we say so) than the £875,000 Bayer Leverkusen have spent on Quansah per appearance from the off under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Anfield.",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are admittedly a very good reason why Quansah’s not played all that much and it’s technically possible for the game time of the third best centre-back in the world to be limited in a similar manner.",
      "But he wouldn’t be in many people’s top 50 as things stand and that was just too delicious a chunk of pure profit to turn down, with the Reds also safe in the knowledge that they can buy him back for £50m should his progression be as impressive as many of us thought it may be a year or so ago.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Felix: Chelsea to Al Nassr, £26m rising to £44m\nThe guaranteed £26m fee brings the total spent by clubs acquiring what we don’t think anyone will disagree are Felix’s limited services to just over £180m.",
      "After bizarrely spending £44m to sign him from Atletico Madrid last summer after a hugely underwhelming loan spell at Stamford Bridge the season before, Chelsea are miraculously set to make all of that money back thanks to Al Nassr, and could actually be up on the deal having already banked close to £5m from his six-month loan spell at AC Milan.",
      "The Blues are also said to have wisely inserted a hefty sell-on clause into the deal with Al Nassr, as another wealthy football club thinking they can ‘fix’ Joao Felix is the third certainty after death and taxes.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "A list of 14 players could reportedly be made available by Chelsea this summer, with some big names expected to be surplus to requirements.",
      "Leeds United will stay in the Premier League if they sign a ‘new Raphinha’. Simple enough, right? We’ve created a ten-player shortlist for Daniel Farke.",
      "Former AC Milan and Chelsea great Marcel Desailly has seen plenty of Joao Felix over his itinerant career and feels he just still hasn’t ‘found his place’",
      "A new report has revealed ‘eleven’ Chelsea players are set to be sold this summer as club chiefs are looking to raise funds for a ‘super signing’."

      "“I’m not sure if Nicolas Jackson is the man for a top team as we’ve seen during his time at Chelsea. It’s an interesting one to see where he goes if he leaves the club. He’s in the Darwin Nunez bracket for me – he gets loads of chances, but he isn’t prolific,” Pennant said.",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Man Utd's Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan; the deal gives Barca the option to buy the England international,  27, at the end of the season; the forward's Man Utd career has appeared over since a public fallout with manager Ruben Amorim last winter",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 07:16, UK",
      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",
      "The only slight hiccup Rashford made all day was timekeeping. He arrived 15 minutes late for the contract signing ceremony, but no one seemed to mind.",
      "The first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker posed near an old English telephone box as part of his official club video.",
      "Apt.",
      "Because at his media unveiling, Marcus Rashford rang the right tone and kept everyone engaged. He may well have found his calling.",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",
