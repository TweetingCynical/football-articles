      "After a stellar season in the Premier League, Bryan Mbeumo finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Tottenham this summer.",
      "The Brentford talisman, 25, is believed to have his heart set on a move to Old Trafford despite the Red Devils' calamitous 2024-25 campaign. But developments at Spurs, where Thomas Frank has been appointed as the club's new manager, has thrown a spanner into the works.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has a big decision to make. But whatever he chooses, it will see him jump from the frying pan into the fire.",
      "He can either join the madhouse that is Manchester United and have at least one season without European football, or go to Tottenham, play in Europe, but accept he is now part of a club which is one of the biggest under-achievers of modern times.",
      "His heart might tell him United will get back to the big time, but his head will be saying Spurs is the safest option. But wherever he ends up, Mbeumo will face the biggest challenge of his career.",
      "It is hard for a lot of people to stomach but for all its recent troubles, Manchester United is still a club with a truly special allure.",
      "It is still a club with a remarkable domestic and global fanbase, it is still a club that could fill a 100,000-seater stadium week in, week out, it is still a club with a wonderfully storied past. In short, it is still an iconic footballing institution. If and when the club becomes a major Premier League force again, it will be the biggest story in town and that is why Mbeumo should fancy the move to Old Trafford ahead of the move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "There are several obvious reasons why Spurs is an attractive proposition but the idea of being part of an exciting United rebuild should be an enticing one. And anyhow, the importance of what will surely turn out to be a Champions League struggle for Spurs is probably overstated.",
      "The talk is that Mbeumo’s heart tells him United … and he should go with his heart.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should go to Tottenham. The Brentford forward is a serious player and moving to Tottenham, with his old boss Thomas Frank, would propel him to another level into the Champions League.",
      "In many ways I admire his ambition and why he wants to move to Manchester United. They are still such a big club with amazing tradition and great pulling power. To be part of a team - him on one side with Matheus Cunha on the other - could be really special if they suddenly reignite a sleeping giant. But what a gamble.",
      "And I refuse to believe it’s just about money and United offering more. Players earn huge wages and United are clearly trying to sell the dream. But Tottenham can offer European football.",
      "Mbeumo is a terrific player One former Premier League manager, who has scouted and discovered countless players, is convinced he is elite level and even likened him to Mo Salah. That good.",
      "His pace, skill, control and stats make him a huge star. He must choose well - because he has got the lot.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should be a man of his word. If he’s told Manchester United he wants to join them then he should go through with that.",
      "What’s changed in the last few weeks? OK his boss at Brentford has joined Tottenham but are Tottenham suddenly in a different position? He knew they had Champions League football weeks ago and he knew United didn’t. If he told United he was sold on their project then not enough has changed since then for him to turn on his heels.",
      "But that still needs United to pay up the money and if they don’t then the player will have to make a choice.",
      "Jurgen Klopp once said he wanted players to push the train rather than ones who just want to jump on it. Mbeumo now has a decision to make which player he wants to be as United look to rebuild.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo should absolutely stick to his guns if Manchester United is the dream ticket.",
      "Tottenham can offer Champions League football and, of course, the lure of working with Thomas Frank again. But as a player approaching his peak years the challenge of restoring an institution like Manchester United to their former glory is surely just as appealing.",
      "The biggest factor here is that United are yet to strike a deal. Given they were leading a one-horse race before Frank swapped Brentford for Spurs, the onus is on them to make this happen.",
      "Forget about what Mbeumo should do next, United have to get this done if they are serious about rebuilding; that's how highly I rate Mbeumo.",
      "If I were in Bryan Mbeumo’s position, I might find myself wondering why Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur represent the only offers seemingly on the table. Only three players scored more Premier League goals than the Cameroonian last season, and yet his options appear to involve either staying put or moving to a club which finished several spots below his Brentford side this season.",
      "Mbeumo will be 26 when the new season begins. His peak years are approaching, but he can’t parlay that 20-goal season into more of a sure thing when it comes to locking in sustained Champions League football - with his two suitors mustering a combined two knockout ties in the competition this decade.",
      "Of the two options, Tottenham looks to be the slightly better fit. A reunion with Thomas Frank speaks for itself, while a first crack at Champions League football for a player still playing second-tier football as recently as 2021 may well be an opportunity he can’t resist.",
      "Yes, the potential upside at Old Trafford may feel greater, but how many others have thought the same in recent years only to find themselves lamenting wasted seasons. Spurs feels like the best option, even if Mbeumo might wonder why there isn’t something even better available to him.",
      "It’s certainly a tricky decision for Mbeumo. It basically boils down to money or European football so it depends on what the Brentford forward wants from his career.",
      "Given the investment that the Red Devils are making this summer, it might not actually be too long before they return to the Champions League and given that Old Trafford is his preferred option, it might make more sense to go there - but it is a big gamble.",
      "However, with Thomas Frank being appointed by Spurs, he will know exactly how to make a success of him North London. And should he manage to replicate the form he has shown over recent seasons in Brentford, there is no reason why Mbeumo can’t play in the Champions League over the coming seasons with Spurs.",
      "And while it might not have been in his thinking yet, a move to North London means he will not have to uproot anything. So as it stands, Spurs would potentially be the better option.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Former Manchester United youngster Angel Gomes believes the weight of the shirt may have stood in the way of some players succeeding for the Premier League club. United finished 16th in the league last season, and will not play in Europe in any capacity next term after losing the Europa League final, but some of their former stars have thrived away from Old Trafford.",
      "Gomes is certainly one of that number, impressing at Lille and earning a summer switch to fellow Ligue 1 side Marseille. He will link up there with Mason Greenwood, the former United forward who scored a career-best 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, Scott McTominay enjoyed the best scoring season of his own career last term to help Napoli win Serie A. McTominay's former United team-mate Romelu Lukaku was also part of that title-winning squad, while former United players Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alexis Sanchez and Matteo Darmian won the same competition with Inter Milan 12 months earlier.",
      "\"\"Players may have been intimidated or not really know about the weight, what it carries and what it takes,\" Gomes told BBC Sport. \"But ultimately, sometimes, it's down to environment, timing and having the right things in place to help you.",
      "\"Some players who have left and gone on to do better than when they were at United, there might be things in place at that certain club, at that moment in time, that helped them succeed. Sometimes it's not as black and white as they failed or they've not held their own there because of the weight of the shirt.\"",
      "Gomes became United's youngest ever Premier League player when he made his debut at the age of 16, but left in 2020 with just 10 senior outings to his name. His form at Lille really caught the eye, earning him a senior England bow under Lee Carsley, and he maintains it was the right decision to leave Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was obviously a difficult process because there are a lot of things that pull you towards staying,\" he added. \"But then you have to think about what is right for your career. There were a lot of things I sacrificed.\"",
      "Gomes thrived for England's Under-21s during his time at Lille, helping the team win the 2023 European Under-21 Championships under Carsley. He made his senior debut under the same manager at the age of 24, featuring in four of the Three Lions' six UEFA Nations League matches in the autumn of 2024.",
      "“He’s a player that we’re probably not used to seeing in terms of that kind of player,\" Carsley said upon handing Gomes his first call-up. \"But yet when we watched a Portugal team or a Spain team: ‘Ah, I really like that No.10. I really like him.’ We’ve got players like that within our pathway that need a chance.",
      "“Angel has had to go to another country to get that. He was such a talent, they had such high hopes for him at Manchester United. He’s just had to find a different route to get to where he is. I expect him to go from strength to strength.”",

      "Axed from Manchester City’s Club World Cup squad, Grealish faces little future at the Etihad Stadium. But with Pep Guardiola’s side having yet to receive any offers for his services, a loan looked more likely.",
      "Tottenham, Everton and former club Aston Villa have also been linked, while it has been suggested that Napoli are keen on spending £45m on his signature this summer.",

      "Garnacho is seen as a better long-term option than Grealish due to his age. Premier League rivals Chelsea and Spurs have also been linked with moves for Garnacho.",
      "Staying in Manchester, the Red Devils also have a tricky decision to make over the future of academy graduate Marcus Rashford. The forward spent the second-half of last season on loan with Aston Villa.",

      "However, the Blues were unable to strike a deal with Napoli before Osimhen surprisingly moved to Galatasaray on loan. That deal is set to expire this summer so the potential of a move to West London could rear its head again.",
      "One of the hottest properties in football now, Gyokeres’ transfer saga has threatened to turn ugly amid interest from Manchester United and Arsenal. Both Premier League sides have been strongly linked with his services but a deal still appears to be some way off.",
      "It has been suggested that Gyokeres could potentially go on strike to force through a move away from Sporting Lisbon, albeit the Portuguese giants have announced that they will not be bullied into selling their star forward. It seems this one could potentially roll on for the remainder of the window.",
      "Despite having already signed Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, United remain keen on signing Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo this summer. A deal does not seem to be too far away with Mbeumo already expressing his desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "But there could however be some late drama with Spurs threatening to hijack a deal, with Thomas Frank keen on being reunited with Mbeumo in North London.",
      "With the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, it would certainly be a surprise to see them let Robertson leave the club. But his future is now up in the air.",
      "The imminent signing of Milos Kerkez looks set to shove Robertson down the pecking order, while a number of reports have suggested that Atletico Madrid could make a move. As it stands, talks are at an early stage but a switch could potentially happen.",
      "A recently crowned European champion, Donnarumma is arguably the best goalkeeper in the world right now. And PSG are understandably desperate to keep hold of him.",
      "But he has just one year left on his deal in the French capital and Man United have been linked with Donnarumma seen as a potential replacement for Andre Onana at Old Trafford. The Italian has reportedly been discussing a Premier League switch with teammates so it could potentially be an option.",
      "Having already done deals for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen this summer, Real Madrid might not be quite done in the transfer market just yet. They have been linked with a move for Benfica star Alvaro Carreras all summer long.",
      "But as of yet, they have struggled to agree a deal with the Portuguese giants. Bruno Lage has spoken out and claimed his side will only sell should they get an acceptable offer so this is one that could potentially roll on."

If you look at Man United's history, they started building a successful team at Old Trafford through the goalkeeper, with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar, and David De Gea.",
      "\"They must bring confidence to the defence as that galvanises the whole back line. I understood why [Erik] ten Hag brought him in, because he worked with him at Ajax. But it’s a different league.",

      "\"If there is a better goalkeeper available, they should take him. It is not only the quality, they need a strong personality. Having a really good goalkeeper lays the foundations and is massively important.”",
      "Meulensteen was a first-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson for the final five years of the Scot’s Old Trafford reign, playing a part in three Premier League title wins. But Meulensteen, speaking exclusively to Tipman Tips, clearly believes United will not be winning any Premier League crowns soon, especially with the defensive options Amorim currently has at his disposal.",
      "And the 61-year-old Dutchman says Harry Maguire is a symptom of United's deep-seated problems. He explained: “Harry Maguire is an interesting one. He’s received praise but it’s more to do with others being bad.",
      "\"To be fairly honest, Harry is not up to the standard of the quality and the calibre that United needs and plenty of examples have shown that. I’m not saying he's a bad player but he lacks certain aspects of his game defensively that don't meet the standards of Man United.”",
      "While Meulensteen acknowledges that it would be hard to make wholesale changes, he says major upheaval would be ideal, explaining: \"They need a clear-out in defence because they’re very vulnerable in that position. There are six to seven centre backs, and most of them are not good enough.",
      "\"There are question marks around all of them. But because the players are on contracts, you can't just offload them ... it will be a complete financial disaster.",
      "“The issue is, you cannot just suddenly say to 16 players … ‘see you later, off you go’. Who are you going to replace them with? You can get stuck, and that is my biggest worry.”",
      "But Meulensteen would like to see Marcus Rashford have an unlikely second chance under Amorim, saying: “I question the fact as to why things broke down so quickly between them. You talk about a boy who bleeds Man United. If there is interest from clubs in Marcus, will he want to leave regardless of whether United want him? It's going to be interesting from his side.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is a good and valuable player when in a good head space. He's probably one of the best left wingers in the world - and they can’t get someone better.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has admitted that he's not sure he would have been able to turn down the mega-money transfer that Bruno Fernandes was recently offered. Fernandes showed the utmost loyalty to Manchester United earlier this month by turning down a reported £100million move to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Pro League, including an estimated £700,000 per-week salary.",
      "Given that the Red Devils have just endured their worst season in Premier League history, finishing 15th and trophyless, many team-mates and fans may not have blamed the club captain for opting to jump ship - especially given that he is approaching the twilight years of his career at 30.",
      "However, Fernandes' leadership qualities were on full display by snubbing the move to Saudi Arabia in favour of remaining at the heart of Ruben Amorim's squad rebuild for 2025/26. And club legend Ferdinand explained that he believes that the decision tells United fans everything they need to know about the attacking midfielder.",
      "\"And listen, I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.'",
      "\"But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%.",
      "\"But the fact that he stayed and said, listen, there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why the managers comfortably give him the armband.\"",
      "However, in the same breath, Ferdinand admitted that he's unsure if he would have been able to turn down the move if he found himself in Fernandes' shoes. He added: \"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no. I've got to be honest.\"",
      "With eight goals and 11 assists to his name this season, Fernandes has often been a shining star in an otherwise dysfunctional United team, and Amorim has already begun improving on positions in which he believes need to be strengthened for 2025/26.",
      "United have already struck a £62.5m deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, and are currently linked with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo as they look to bolster their presence in front of goal. Amorim appears to have the full backing of the board, which, combined with his first pre-season tour, should go a long way to fine-tuning his set-up.",
      "Ferdinand, meanwhile, recently launched his Career Transfer Hub in collaboration with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and their parents in terms of future planning. Speaking on the cause, he said: \"I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time. So I wish I'd had this when I was younger - although I had football, which I was quite fortunate with.\"",
      "Rio Ferdinand has partnered with Talking Futures to launch the Career Transfer Hub – giving parents access to information on their child’s education options just like football agents have transfer insiders, negotiation teams and career scouts. You can find out more here.",

      "He was outstanding for Brentford last season but a £70million valuation of Bryan Mbeumo seems a touch excessive. But it seems that is what Spurs are prepared to pay in order to secure his services.",
      "As no-one knows Mbeumo better than Thomas Frank, perhaps the 25-year-old is worth that sort of money but, on the overall evidence of his six years in England, it seems a touch excessive. And it would seem unlikely that Manchester United would match or better that figure.",
      "But they might not need to. Mbeumo might tell Brentford that he wants to go to Old Trafford, not Spurs. As unlikely as it seems, Mbeumo could well be a test case for United’s pulling power, which was once unrivalled and has not faded as much as some people might think.",
      "On the face of it, there are many reasons why a move to Spurs is a very attractive proposition for Mbeumo. In no particular order …",
      "*He will be playing in the Champions League.",
      "*He will be playing for a manager he clearly likes and has a relatively long and happy relationship with.",
      "*He will not have to leave London.",
      "And on the face of it, there are many reasons why a move to United is not an unequivocally attractive proposition. In no particular order …",
      "*He will be playing for a manager who might not be there that long.",
      "*He will be playing for a team that finished five places and 14 points below Brentford last season.",
      "*He will not be playing in any European competition, never mind the Champions League.",
      "But there is one fundamental reason why Mbeumo might try and insist on going north. It is still Manchester United. And whenever United re-establish themselves as an elite force in the Premier League - which they will, sooner or later - it will be the biggest story in town.",
      "That is a fact, like it or not. (And I get it that a lot of people don’t.) One of Jurgen Klopp’s mantras was about wanting players who would ‘push the train, not jump on the running train.’",
      "It was a reference to players who relished the challenge of being key to the revitalisation of a team. From his decision to join United and from his comments when signing, Matheus Cunha seems that sort of character.",
      "“I know it’s been a hard season for everyone,” said Cunha. “But I think my decision shows what this club is for me and what I believe this club can be. For me, no-one else is like United.”",
      "And again, a lot of people will not like it, but you can see where Cunha is coming from. Listen, money will play a part. It always does.",
      "United will probably be in a position to pay Mbeumo considerably more than he might earn at Tottenham Hotspur. And a cynic might think the prospect of more money and, with no European football, a lighter workload might be of considerable appeal to the modern footballer.",
      "But for all the club’s tribulations, for all the club’s mediocrity on the field, Manchester United is still a huge draw for a player. And in the case of their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, Spurs might just be about to be reminded of that.",

      "Manchester City new boy Rayan Cherki has vowed to 'kill' Manchester United when he dons the blue shirt next season after Ruben Amorim's side crushed his Europa League dreams.",
      "Cherki, 21, joined the former Premier League champions in a £31million deal earlier this week as Pep Guardiola continues to overhaul a squad that were completely outgunned by Liverpool in the race for the domestic crown last season.",
      "And Cherki, still smarting from Lyon's heartbreaking European exit at the hands of the red half of Manchester, has instantly endeared himself to his new fans by taking aim at United.",
      "“I don’t like when Manchester United won the game against Lyon because I am a Lyonnais [he was born in Lyon]. Now I am waiting for the game [to] kill them,” he said.",
      "Cherki is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Europe after a stellar season with the French giants, including a goal in the dramatic 5-4 loss against United in the Europa League quarter-finals.",
      "He goaded United fans by grabbing his crotch in celebration before a late, late show left Cherki and Lyon with broken hearts. The attacking midfielder now has his sights set on far grander prizes after swapping Lyon for Manchester and will star for Guardiola's new-look side at the FIFA Club World Cup before participating in the Champions League.",
      "And the ultra-confident France star also has his sights set on the Ballon d'Or, too. “When you see Rodri here, he won the Ballon d’Or — it’s clear tht with Manchester City it’s possible and I am here for this,” Cherki added.",
      "“I want to win everything with City. When I spoke with Pep [Guardiola] he said he wanted me. He was very, very clear [on that] and the system, the club, the city is very good for me.”",
      "Cherki's arrival coincides with the departure of club legend, Kevin De Bruyne, who brought the curtain down on a decade of brilliance last month. The exciting attacker insists he is not a ready-made replacement for the Napoli-bound maestro, though. “I’m not Kevin de Bruyne - he’s the legend (of the club),” he said.",
      "“I’m here to help the team. We have the best players in the world. I work and I wait my turn. I spoke with Pep about my position on the pitch and we spoke about what I enjoy when I’m on the pitch. It’s very good for me. He told me he loves a No10, but now I play all the positions in the pitch - so it’s not complicated because I just want to play.",
      "“Pep told me, 'When you have the ball, you are free' which is very good for me because it’s my first quality to help the team.”",

      "Inter are said to be moving 'full speed ahead' for Hojlund and hope to sign him on loan with an 'almost certain' option to buy. Although United would prefer to sell the player this summer, it is claimed that an 'expensive' loan fee could tempt them.",
      "Hojlund was recently asked about his future while on international duty with Denmark and told TV2 Sport: \"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.",

      "Sir Mo Farah's name will always be mentioned as one of Team GB's all-time legends at the Olympic Games. He won two gold medals in London in 2012 and two more at the Rio De Janeiro games four years later, captivating the sporting world on his way to a knighthood in 2017, where Queen Elizabeth II made him a Sir.",
      "He will be wearing an England shirt with 'Farah' emblazoned on the back when he steps onto the Old Trafford pitch for Soccer Aid this weekend. Yet, the name on the Three Lions shirt, the name that was pinned onto his running vest and the name next to his many records is not really his.",
      "In 2022, as part of the eye-opening BBC documentary 'The Real Mo Farah', the athlete revealed his name was not 'Mo Farah' and that he had been living under somebody else's identity.",
      "Farah, 42, revealed his real name was Hussein Abdi Kahin. When he was only four years old, Farah, who was originally from Somaliland, lost his father, who was killed while tending to his cattle by a piece of shrapnel from a bazooka blast during Somalia's civil war.",
      "After being sent to neighbouring Djibouti for his safety, Farah would eventually be illegally trafficked into the United Kingdom. A woman, whose identity is still unknown, pretended to be his mother and brought him to the UK under the premise that he would be staying with family.",
      "He was instructed to come into the country under the name Mo Farah - who was a different child - and was handed illegal documents. This dangerous process went through while he was only nine years old. He realised he had taken someone else's place at the airport when he saw a man wondering why his child had not arrived.",
      "When he got to the woman's flat, she tore up a piece of paper with his family's contact details on it and ordered him to look after the children of another family. He told the BBC: \"If I wanted food in my mouth, my job was to look after those kids, shower them, cook for them, clean for them. She said, 'If you ever wanna see your family again, don’t say anything.' Often I would just lock myself in the bathroom and cry.\"",
      "At the age of 11, Farah enrolled into Feltham Community College. Teachers and other staff at the school were told he was a refugee from Somalia. His form tutor Sarah Rennie said Farah was, \"unkempt and uncared for\" and \"emotionally and culturally alienated,\" largely due to the lack of English he spoke.",
      "It was during PE lessons when the teachers realised he was an athletics prodigy. Alan Watkinson, Farah's PE teacher, said: \"The only language he seemed to understand was the language of PE and sport.\"",
      "Watkinson would go on to contact social services who managed to find another family from Somalia to foster him. Mr Watkinson helped him gain British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah, which was granted in 2000.",
      "From that point onwards, Farah developed as a person and an athlete, going on to become a four-time Olympic gold medallist and a six-time world champion. When Farah was sent away, he had to leave his mother Aisha and two brothers, who all live on a farm in Somaliland.",
      "Farah met his now-wife Tania Nell while at university in West London. Together they have four children, Rhianna, Hussein Mo, Amani and Aisha Farah.",
      "Incredibly, in the documentary, Farah also met the real Mohamed Farah over a video call. However, The Sun claimed the athlete had to break contact with him and change his phone number, after he was allegedly hounded for money by the man and around ten others who had got hold of his number.",

      "\"I've known Dave now for quite a few years and it's for good reasons,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe assured us. \"He is obsessive about performance in elite sports, and he is going to be very successful at Manchester United.\"",
      "No, he isn't. Had Brailsford not stepped back from his prominent position at United and the team become a success, none of it would have been down to him.",
      "Brailsford, as he admitted to Nasser Hussain in November 2023, is \"no football expert\". Ratcliffe complained about the \"rugby man\" Richard Arnold. Brailsford is a cycling guy. Arnold was more of a success during a fraught two years as chief executive.",
      "The chances are the majority reading this are more qualified than Brailsford to be on the United football board. Our football knowledge outweighs Brailsford's and that buzzphrase, 'high performance', is as meaningless as Brailsford's presence at United. He was not worthy of the Paul Smith-tailored club suit.",
      "United used sleep and meal windows, individually-tailored compression garments to increase blood circulation and a hydration plan in pre-season. That had Brailsford's fingerprints all over it. The finger of blame cannot be pointed solely at him for United then suffering their worst season in 51 years.",
      "Brailsford did not endear himself, either. His aloofness was so striking and not in keeping with other Ineos appointments. Dan Ashworth was personable during our sole sit-down with him, Omar Berrada is an engaging talker, Jason Wilcox has offered the odd \"hello\" and Toby Craig, the director of communications, can be loquacious in an appropriate setting.",
      "At Carrington once, Brailsford literally walked the other way when journalists approached him. When he used the wrong door to enter United's Beverly Hills hotel last summer, he completely blanked colleagues.",
      "Heads had to roll at United last season and one had to be in the hierarchy. Brailsford was a logical fall-guy, whatever the spin that it was always part of the plan that he would return to his wheelhouse of cycling. Ratcliffe's promise in February 2024 that Brailsford would be \"very successful\" undermines that script.",
      "Throughout Brailsford's 18 months at United, nobody at the club provided a satisfactory rationale for his presence. The closest was from Ashworth in response to a query from this correspondent.",
      "Ashworth billed Brailsford as a de facto performance director, someone United would tap into to get the squad back up to speed. Brailsford was billed as a \"genius\" by Ashworth in September and mentioned in the same breath as Berrada, Wilcox and Erik ten Hag among the management team.",
      "This columnist queried Brailsford's role again in March and recommended he be dismissed last month. United are getting there.",
      "MBEUMO: RIGHT MAN FOR THE RIGHT WING",
      "At the risk of embarking on a victory lap, yours truly wrote in November 2023, \"While the focus is inevitably on Ivan Toney, if United are to telephone Brentford about a player it ought to be Bryan Mbeumo.\"",
      "The piece centred on United's need for a diligent and pure right winger. That position has been an unfixable problem since Antonio Valencia assumed the number seven shirt in 2012 and was so cursed by it he requested to revert to his old number 25 after one season.",
      "Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Daniel James, Mason Greenwood and Antony all had purple patches. In Zaha's case, it was merely a propitious pre-season. Then he was restricted to two competitive starts.",
      "Januzaj was mismanaged, Mkhitaryan was a mismatch, James was a cost-efficient punt, Greenwood was all-but-excommunicated and Antony was execrable. Diogo Dalot, a right back by trade, is more of a defender than an attacker.",
      "If United get Mbeumo, he has to occupy the right wing. The majority of his starts came there in a career-best season for Brentford, albeit predominantly in a 4-2-3-1 formation, and United need attacking nous on the flanks.",
      "Some still call them 'wing backs'. Look at Amorim's set-up at Sporting. The wide players were wingers as the system is geared up to service the striker. Mbeumo is such a multi-functional talent he can operate as an attacker or a defender, he is that reliable.",
      "Going to United, the pressure would be tenfold. Only three players scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in 2024-25 and if he gets 10 for United - half the 20 he tallied for Brentford - it will be a creditable contribution.",
      "United do not require all-change in the two playmaker roles and it would be drastic to have a completely new front three. Amad offers continuity, with Bruno Fernandes seemingly set for a central midfield remit if he stays.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad could dovetail on that right-hand side. The 3-4-2-1 has been rigid when it should be fluid and Mbeumo would assist that transition from pragmatism to proactivism. If United are defending a lead, he is the one you want in your own third.",
      "It was nearly four years ago that Mbeumo scored at Old Trafford in a 2-2 pre-season friendly as masked fans were invited back into stadiums. He deftly cushioned a clipped ball past Dalot, had two more touches to adjust the angle and curled the ball beyond the reach of Tom Heaton. Mbeumo was playing on the right wing.",
      "Mbeumo overtook Dalot in 2021 and may do so again in 2025.",
      "STRIKER STRIFE?",
      "United missed out on Liam Delap but he will not be missed. He has excellent attributes but they did not need a striker four days younger than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Delap's move to Chelsea could risk United's striker search descending into that dreaded word - saga - this summer. Number 9s who have created a market for themselves will want to be linked with United, whether it is concrete or baseless, and the more names the more chaotic it appears.",
      "That is not on United. They had contingency plans in place before Delap rejected them and are seldom responsible for the flurry of stories that emerge in the close season.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo are targets to strengthen the first team but a striker is an absolute priority. It does not always mean they are first through the door. Last year, the most important position for United to address was defensive midfield and the signing of Manuel Ugarte was not announced until gone 9pm on deadline day.",
      "United had to wait for one to go out (Scott McTominay) for one to come in. Fulham did not get close to McTominay's valuation before Napoli muscled in. McTominay left United on the same day that Ugarte officially arrived.",
      "Signing two centre halves, a right back and one striker (who it turned out was not a striker) after ending the 2023-24 campaign with a minus goal difference was patently the wrong balance. The mitigation is Joshua Zirkzee had a release clause and Anthony Martial's outstayed welcome had expired. United also had the leverage to recruit Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui as Raphael Varane and Aaron Wan-Bissaka had made room.",
      "Leny Yoro was the real showstopper. So much so senior figures at Everton were surprised United suddenly stopped bidding for Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo will cost United well north of £100million. They also have, technically, two strikers, so someone has to make way.",
      "At least Inter Milan have enquired about Hojlund."

      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened for business, meaning Manchester United have between now and 7pm on September 1 to get all of their shopping done.",
      "After opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period for the Club World Cup, the window temporarily closed last Tuesday evening, marking a six-day pause in transfer activity. However, it will now remain open without any further interruptions.",
      "Despite a temporary pause, that did not stop United from officially announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million last Thursday. United had announced they had reached an agreement with their Premier League counterparts to sign him on June 1.",
      "Cunha had been a long-term target for United, meaning they are delighted to have secured his signature nice and early. He should be the first of a handful of new recruits at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In securing Cunha's signature so early, United made their mark on the window quickly, highlighting just how keen they are to show some ambition.",
      "As well as getting a deal in place to sign Cunha prior to the temporary closure, they also made their first move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55m turned down just under a fortnight ago but talks between the two clubs remain ongoing.",
      "Mbeumo has informed Brentford's hierarchy that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer. However, United are yet to table a second bid for the Cameroon international.",
      "However, since the window temporarily closed last Tuesday, Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with interest in Mbeumo. That was almost inevitable after Spurs recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach.",
      "Despite having an excellent relationship with Frank, Mbeumo is understood to be determined to move to Old Trafford. United want to strengthen their attacking options this summer and adding the versatile attacker to the addition of Cunha would be a real statement of intent.",
      "It is believed Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to what United paid for Cunha, although the Brazilian was signed via a release clause. United would like to sign Mbeumo ahead of pre-season starting in July.",
      "Elsewhere, United remain determined to sign a striker this summer. After missing out on Liam Delap earlier this month, they have been linked with a crop of alternative options, including the likes of Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and most recently Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Whoever United plan to try and make their first-choice No.9 will be dependent on outgoings. The prospect of signing Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m will take their spending past the £120m mark before sanctioning any sales.",
      "United are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. Head coach Ruben Amorim wants a new shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also possible.",
      "Much of what United will be able to do on the incoming front will rest on outgoings. Preparing to oversee up to ten departures, United have a collection of players they would like to offload this summer.",
      "The Reds have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales. Each of them spent time out on loan in 2024/25 and United want to offload them permanently ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available at £32.5m and Sancho could command a fee of somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty clause to break their obligation to sign him permanently.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Old Trafford for the right price. Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for him back in January, meaning United are expected to ask for a fee north of £50m.",
      "The former is attracting interest from Inter Milan and it remains to be seen if they will submit a formal offer for the Denmark international. He scored just ten goals for United in 2024/25."

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been all over the headlines this summer after yet another sensational season for Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Incredibly, the Swede has scored 97 goals in two seasons for the Portuguese club which is proof enough that Gyokeres is worthy of all the interest circulating around him. Manchester United and Arsenal appear to be leading the way for the 27-year-old but they are not alone in their desire to sign him.",
      "Serie A giants Juventus are also looking on while a move to the Saudi Pro League is not thought to be out of the question either. So with all the toing and froing that is encompassing the Gyokeres deal, MEN Sport has taken the time to round-up everything you need to know about the current situation.",
      "The first thing to point out with Gyokeres is that this move could run smoothly for all involved. Sporting included a £85m release clause in Gyokeres' contract and should that be met by either United, Arsenal or whoever else, then the Lisbon club could not stand his way of an exit.",
      "However, the complications arise surrounding the 'gentleman's agreement' that either exists or does not, depending on who you listen to.",
      "Gyokeres' camp believe that Sporting agreed to sell the Swede for roughly £51m up front and £8.5m in add-ons this summer. It is believed this was agreed as a thank you for his efforts in Lisbon since arriving.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has disputed this and insisted that he would not sell Gyokeres for as little as £60m all in. This was disputed again in the Portuguese media with Gyokeres' agency claiming that they have the agreement in writing.",
      "To his credit, Gyokeres has managed to stay out of this situation for the most part. During the season, he was asked if he liked London to which he replied that he liked Lisbon.",
      "It was claimed that Gyokeres deleted reference to Sporting on his Instagram bio as evidence that he was unhappy with the club blocking his exit. However, he fired a cryptic message shortly afterwards which read: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it false.",
      "\"I will speak when the time is right.\" It is unclear whether this was aimed at Sporting or media reports about his happiness.",
      "Varandas has since clarified his stance regarding Gyokeres' release clause. He admits that he will not hold the player to his release clause but no price was ever agreed.",
      "\"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27,\" the president explained to Record. \"Then, we knew Viktor's dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "\"We guaranteed that we would not demand 100 million (£85m). In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of 60 million (£51m), 70 million (£59.7m)... And I said: 'There's no point in setting a value,' because I don't know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season...",
      "\"From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. Ten months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word.",
      "\"The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\"",
      "In Portugal, further reports emerged on Sunday to suggest that Arsenal had frozen their interest in Gyokeres. It was claimed that the Gunners were frustrated by Sporting's desire to stick to their £68m asking price.",
      "Arsenal would therefore turn their attention to other targets, including Ollie Watkins at Aston Villa.",
      "Gyokeres and Ruben Amorim have a good working relationship and it would be shocking if the Reds were not interested in him. MEN Sport understands that Bryan Mbeumo remains the priority for the time being as they look to seal that deal before Tottenham.",
      "However, a striker is next on their incoming agenda. That search was delayed at the beginning of the window after Liam Delap chose Chelsea ahead of the Reds.",
      "To add even more confusion to the matter, Juventus are trying to muscle in on the act. The Turin club want to sign Gyokeres as a replacement for Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "Corriere dello Sport understands that the Turin club are willing to offer him a salary of £11m per year if he was to commit to them. However, the catch is that they would need to offload Vlahovic before pursuing Gyokeres.",
      "Now that is all explained, here is how the bookmakers bet365 see this situation unfolding, based on which club Gyokeres will be at by September 3, when the transfer window will have shut."

      "Asked if some players move to Old Trafford and struggle to deal with the 'weight of the shirt', Gomes said: \"I think, naturally, it's a massive step up coming from whichever club you come from to play for Manchester United, and I think the players might have been a bit intimidated by the club and not really know the weight and what it carries, and what it takes.",
      "\"But I think ultimately, sometimes it's down to the environment and the timing, the right things in place to help you. I don't think sometimes it's as black and white as they failed or they've not held their own there because of the weight.",

      "Manchester United have struggled to find a prolific striker capable of successfully overcoming the weight that comes with leading the line at Old Trafford.",
      "Without Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcus Rashford, United have had many strikers come and fail. Edinson Cavani, despite seeming at the time to be prolific, scored just 19 goals whereas Antony Martial's difficulties ended in him leaving the club for nothing.",
      "Two years ago, United coughed up £72million to bring Rasmus Hojlund to the club. The then-20-year-old had scored 10 goals for Atalanta after five with Copenhagen and 12 at Sturm Graz. When you look at the numbers, it's quite remarkable that he cost so much.",
      "Following a season where he showed plenty of promise and clinical eye for goal, Hojlund struggled in his second campaign. The Denmark international scored just four Premier League goals and is one of the players United would happily sell this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha's signing from Wolves bolsters United's attack but the priority is adding to the Brazilian. Bryan Mbeumo is likely to be the next new face through the door but a centre-forward is expected to follow and it's difficult to know which one they want.",
      "Liam Delap was the first number one target before he signed for Chelsea and Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly targeting a move to Arsenal. There remains other targets like Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike, but United have been known for pulling off some outrageous deals.",
      "Previously, Harry Kane was United's number one target. It was reported that they failed to bring him to Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag prior to his move to Bayern Munich, deciding against spending £100m for one of the world's best to save £28m to sign Hojlund.",
      "Now 32, Kane has ended his wait for silverware at Bayern with the Bundesliga title. A return to England has been mooted in recent months and while it seems far-fetched to think of Kane walking out at Old Trafford, hear us out.",
      "According to respected outlet BILD, the German champions hold an interest in RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko. It's said they view the 22-year-old as Kane's long-term replacement and they could move for him this summer.",
      "Priced at £75m, Sesko is Arsenal's number one target after bagging 21 goals in spite of a disappointing season for Leipzig. Surprisingly, the report adds that should Sesko be signed, Bayern would bring Kane back into the number 10 role with his tendency to drop deep complimenting that.",
      "Sesko to the Allianz Arena has work to do with Arsenal claiming to 'hold the upper hand' but Bayern's pull in Germany is telling. If a move did materialise, it's not yet clear whether Kane would be happy with being moving away from centre-forward.",
      "Step forward, Jason Wilcox. The signing of Kane would come at the perfect time with Amorim desperate for a striker to hit the ground running.",
      "The issue with Gyokeres, Osimhen or Ekitike, they have zero Premier League experience. They all carry doubts over their heads that will come as a concern, whereas Kane has scored 213 goals - 47 goals behind Alan Shearer.",
      "Whether United would entertain the prospect of signing Kane, or whether the England international would be open to returning to England. However, if Bayern do pull off a deal for Sesko, it would be the perfect green light for United to swoop in and bring in the ready-made goalscorer needed."

United have already begun their transfer business for the summer, with Matheus Cunha arriving from Wolves after the club activated the £62.5million release clause in his contract.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is considered to be the next priority for United during this summer's transfer window. Tottenham Hotspur, though, are also in the running for the Cameroon international's signature.",
      "United have already submitted a bid to try and sign Mbeumo this summer. Brentford rejected United's offer which was worth an initial fee of £55million plus a further £10million in add-ons.",
      "There have been reports that Mbeumo is valued closer to £70million by the Bees, with the forward under contract until next summer with the option of extending for a further year until 2027.",
      "It's understood that United remain confident they can agree a deal to sign Mbeumo from Brentford this summer.",
      "Tottenham are understood to be \"going hard\" in their efforts to try and beat United to the signing of Mbeumo. United are still confident they can agree a deal to sign Mbeumo despite the interest from Spurs.",

      "Onana and Mbeumo are teammates for Cameroon and were last in action alongside one another for their country back in March in a World Cup qualifier against Libya.",
      "Mbeumo has recently spoken about his future amid interest from United and Tottenham. Spurs recently appointed former Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new manager, and Mbeumo says that he \"accepts\" that his future has become the subject of transfer speculation.",
      "\"He (Frank)'s done so much for me. He literally trusted me from the start. I think he developed the team so well. He developed me as a human and a player as well.",

      "Inter Milan have made Rasmus Hojlund their primary target this summer, according to reports over in Italy, while Manchester United are reportedly open to a quick sale.",
      "The Denmark striker's future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain, with a move back to Serie A on the cards just two seasons after he joined United from Atalanta for £64million. After two underwhelming campaigns, the 22-year-old could be sold for nearly half of what the club originally paid, it has been said.",
      "Both Inter Milan and Napoli have shown interest in Hojlund, but Gazzetta dello Sport now reckon that Inter have moved ahead in the race and have made him their number one target.",
      "They explained the situation using Hojlund's Tour de France friend, Jonas Vingegaard, as a metaphor, where they wrote: \"Hojlund has climbed on the pedals, as if he were his compatriot Jonas Vingegaard, a champion of the bike and winner of two Tours.",
      "\"Now, he's ahead of everyone in the club's preferences for the attack of the future; there is finally room for an investment up front and, at the moment, nowhere seems to deserve it more.\"",
      "Inter Milan are reportedly working on the deal, while competing in the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. Hojlund is said to be intrigued by the idea of joining the Italian giants.",
      "As per Corriere dello Sport, United have set Hojlund's price tag between €40million-€45million (£34million-£38.3million) - less than half the original fee. The club are eager to raise funds quickly, for their own summer business, which includes mooted targets like Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen.",
      "Interestingly, Corriere also claim that United have chosen to keep Joshua Zirkzee over Hojlund, despite the Denmark forward finishing last season with three more goal involvements than the Dutchman. Both players, however, had relatively quiet 2024/2525 campaigns.",
      "While United are reportedly seeking a straight cash sale, Inter Milan favour a loan deal - with an obligation to buy. The decision now lies with United head coach Ruben Amorim, who must determine whether Hojlund remains part of his long-term vision."

      "There are some ongoing changes at Manchester United that most fans won't notice.",
      "The revised transfer strategy of signing talented youngsters falls into that category. United have always signed young players to add to their academy, but the profile of targets has evolved.",
      "Sekou Kone (19) was signed from Mali, Diego Leon (18) has been scouted from Paraguay, while Enzo Kana-Biyik (18) is set to arrive on a free transfer from the renowned academy of French club Le Havre AC.",
      "Ayden Heaven, Chido Obi, James Overy, Samuel Lusale and Harley Emsden-James have also been lured to Manchester with the promise of a pathway to first-team football at Old Trafford.",
      "Heaven and Obi have already broken into the senior squad. Ruben Amorim gave opportunities to both players last season and they will be used as a shining example to future targets.",
      "United's transfer strategy has become interesting, although it could be argued they are simply catching up with the times. Premier League rivals have cast their nets around the globe to sign young players with high ceilings, some of whom will never make a first-team appearance in England.",
      "Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have been a huge factor and some Premier League clubs are buying young players with the intention of making a profit on their sale in a few years' time.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Chelsea signed Angelo Gabriel from Santos for £13million. They immediately sent him on loan and sold him to a Saudi Arabian club for £19.4m the following summer.",
      "Around a similar time, Newcastle signed Yankuba Minteh from OB for £5.9m. Minteh joined Feyenoord on loan and was flipped to Brighton for £30m in the following summer.",
      "Angelo and Minteh didn't make an appearance for Chelsea and Newcastle. Such transfers have become common to work within PSR rules, despite being against the essence of football.",
      "United sources would deny that young players are being signed to be 'flipped', but the reality is that not every signing will make the grade and some will be sold for profit down the line.",
      "Club sources stress that each young signing in the last 18 months has been made because they have first-team potential, however, that does not guarantee they will make a senior debut.",
      "The transfers are essentially low risk and high reward. For example, United signed Kone for around £1m for Guidars FC and the young midfielder arrived in Manchester with a huge upside.",
      "The best-case scenario is that Kone breaks into the first-team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "Similar signings were made by the previous regime, but they have increased since Ineos gained control of football operations. Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "The club's network of scouts present reports on young players and Kone was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members from United watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "After following Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where he featured as one of the players of the tournament.",
      "It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament and there was communication between the club's scouting team in order to make the deal happen.",
      "Deals to sign Obi, Overy and Lusale were also arranged last summer. United became aware that Obi wanted to leave Arsenal and was about to join a European club after visiting their training ground.",
      "Nick Cox (head of the academy), Luke Fedderenko (head of academy recruitment), Stephen Ajewole (lead scout) and Sam Williams (lead scout) all played a huge role in signing Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Overy (18) attracted interest from other Premier League clubs but he signed for United, while Lusale (17) was signed from Crystal Palace, and they both went into the U18 squad.",
      "The signing of Emsden-James, 16, from Southampton this summer is similar to those deals. The centre-back will join up with the U18s in 2024/2025 and still has a long way to progress to make a first-team debut.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how United handle Kone, Leon and Kana-Biyik ahead of 2025/2026.",
      "Kone could leave on loan after being given time to find his feet in England, but Leon might be kept within the building so he can adapt to his new surroundings after leaving South America.",
      "Leon completed a medical to finalise his move from Paraguay side Cerro Porteno in early January and the defender signed a five-year contract, with the option of an additional year.",
      "It's understood United agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno and Leon continued to play in Paraguay with a view to moving to Manchester this summer.",
      "United are expected to formally announce the arrivals of Leon and Kana-Biyik. The latter is joining from Le Havre on a free transfer and only a few regulatory steps remain for him to complete his move.",
      "The highly-regarded Kana-Biyik is a natural striker and he scored nine goals in 16 appearances for the French club's Under-19s last season, while also training with their first-team.",
      "Kana-Biyik has been linked with an immediate loan move to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport, but it's understood that no loan plan has been confirmed for the incoming French youngster.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",
      "The role of Matt Hargreaves as director of football negotiations should also be noted. Hargreaves has a large responsibility for transfers and contracts at Old Trafford, and is known to be an excellent operator.",
      "Representatives have spoken glowingly about Hargreaves and have praised his understanding of players, the football business and negotiations, so he is seen as a valuable member of staff.",
      "Hargreaves does exactly what his job title says on the tin and will continue to try to obtain value during negotiations this summer, wherever that may be found across the world."

      "Paul Scholes once dubbed former Manchester United team-mate Nemanja Vidic as a \"lunatic,\" as the two prepare to clash at Soccer Aid.",
      "The two Red Devils icons will be part of the star-studded cast returning to Old Trafford on Sunday evening to help raise funds for Unicef through a charitable football match. Though they shared great success during their time together in the Premier League, Scholes and Vidic find themselves on opposing sides for Soccer Aid.",
      "Scholes will stand with fellow English legends Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Gary Neville against Vidic's World XI team, featuring John O'Shea, Carlos Tevez and Edwin van der Sar. While the event promises to be an entertaining showdown between old teammates and celebrities, Scholes' previous remarks on Vidic suggest he may be a little anxious on coming up against him.",
      "The Serbian defender was known for his robust style and no-nonsense approach during his stint at United. Previously speaking to the UTD podcast about what Vidic was like to play alongside, the 50-year-old said: \"I was fairly good at tackling. It was all calculated. I was just getting people back. That's all I was doing.",
      "\"I never instigated. If someone got me, there's a chance I'd get them back. Vida [Vidic] had some tackles in the box, he could be a lunatic,\" reports the Mirror.",
      "He added: \"He didn't play as a centre half in five-a-side. He was one of those defenders that thought he could play a bit as a No. 10. You know what I mean?",
      "\"When you get to a five-a-side he does anything but play in his position, 'Give it to me' all that stuff. But when it came to a match he would head and kick everything.",
      "\"In training he could be a bit moody and a nuisance in the box especially but a great centre half. He was perfect for English football. He could head the ball, tackle, he was great, a really good player.\"",
      "After quickly establishing a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand upon arriving at Old Trafford in 2006, Vidic made 300 appearances for the Red Devils, winning five Premier League titles, three League Cups and a Champions League. Vidic left United in 2014 to join Inter Milan, before retiring from an illustrious career in January 2016.",
      "Scholes, on the other hand, spent his entire professional football career with United, scoring 155 goals and providing 82 assists in 716 games, primarily as a central midfielder. Alongside Vidic, he is among a host of well-known names who will participate in Soccer Aid on Sunday, including content creators like Morgan Burtwhistle (AKA AngryGinge) and fellow athletes like Sir Mo Farah and Tony Bellew.",
      "Football enthusiasts can watch all the action live on ITV1 and ITVX from 6pm onwards. The match is scheduled to kick off at 7:30pm."

      "Only six players in the entire squad managed to score more than two league goals all season. One of those six players was sold in Scott McTominay, another was shipped out on loan during the mid-season window in Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo can't even get into the starting XI.",
      "Of the five major signings United made in the 2024 summer window, three of them were defenders and one was a defensive midfielder. Joshua Zirkzee represented the only attacking arrival, yet his haul of 13 goals in two years in Serie A hardly suggested he would be the answer to United's goalscoring woes.",
      "Did they really expect things to get any better? If they did then they'll have been very disappointed.",
      "Things only got worse in the 2024/25 season, with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee - the club's two senior centre forwards - managing just seven league goals between them. United scored 13 goals fewer last season than they managed in 2023/24, recording a -10 goal difference as they finished 15th in the table, having looked set to finish just one place above the relegation zone at one point.",

      "And then there's the big question of who will lead the line next season.",

      "Manchester United face their most pivotal transfer window in recent memory after a disastrous campaign.",
      "Losing the Europa League final and finishing 15th spot in the Premier League means that there will be no European football at Old Trafford for the first time in over a decade. It means United's task of rebuilding under Ruben Amorim has become that little bit harder, for multiple reasons.",
      "The transfer window opened initially for 10 days - from June 1 to June 10 - to allow the clubs competing in the Club World Cup to strengthen their squads before the tournament began. The Reds used that opportunity to secure the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "And with the transfer window reopening in a couple of days, Isaac Seelochan has taken a look at what a best-case summer would look like for Amorim and the Reds.",
      "United's main focus should be on snapping-up a striker to try and solve their goal-scoring problems. The Reds have reportedly entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike and, with Liverpool and Chelsea also said to be interested, his signing would be a huge coup.",
      "Frankfurt are said to be demanding around £85million (€100million) for Ekitike, who has four years left on his deal. Negotiating a much lower fee will be needed, but it's a deal United should be pursuing.",
      "Elsewhere, with Amorim being backed to turn things around, the Reds will need better quality wing-backs to suit his system. Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo would be a great signing and a massive upgrade on United's current options in that position.",
      "Midfield will need strengthening due to Casemiro's age, Mason Mount's injury record and Christian Eriksen's departure. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is one of the brightest English midfielders around at the moment.",
      "Wharton is a Premier League regular for the Eagles, who played a huge role in their shock FA Cup win. The 21-year-old is also an England international who has been to a major tournament with the Three Lions. Ineos appears to be targeting young stars at Old Trafford, and he fits the bill perfectly.",
      "Another area of concern is between the posts, with both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır struggling badly last season. Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma was excellent in the Champions League-winning campaign and has been linked with a move to M16.",
      "Getting transfer fees for the players who spent much of last season on loan will be a necessity. Marcus Rashford's homegrown status will mean any sale represents pure profit and a much-needed PSR boost.",
      "Selling Rashford to Barcelona would be ideal, as the Reds would avoid the possible embarrassment of him coming back to haunt his former side anytime soon, at least domestically.",
      "Antony enjoyed the best season out of United's loanees and a permanent move to Spain would be perfect for all parties. Matching United's valuation is likely to be an issue for most Spanish clubs, but a switch to Atletico Madrid has been mooted.",
      "Jadon Sancho will be tricky to shift, though, after Chelsea paid the Reds around £5million to avoid signing him on a permanent deal. Again, a move abroad would be ideal, but clubs may struggle to match United's valuation, after his average loan spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "If a new goalkeeper joins, it seems unlikely that Onana will stay. It will be difficult for anyone to match his reported £26million valuation, but selling him needs to be looked at.",
      "Finally, with it appearing that Alejandro Garnacho faces no future under Amorim, getting a reasonably fee for the young star would be a massive boost. Like Rashford, his homegrown status will hand the club some wriggle room with so many new signings needed."

      "Leon plays as a left-wing-back and he will, of course, have to force his way past Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass in the pecking order.",
      "It is more likely he will play with the under-21s to begin with but Amorim has shown he is not afraid to throw in youngsters when they are ready, handing debuts to teenagers Amass, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven this season.",
      "If Leon can deliver on his promise it will be the first success story of Ineos prioritising the signing of young players with high potential and low transfer fees.",
      "And that prospect should excite United fans."

      "Arsenal are still keeping their striker options open with a third wheel reportedly in the mix, but their hopes of landing a Real star are getting slimmer…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Jarrad Branthwaite – Everton to Tottenham\nAre Tottenham and Manchester United using the same scouts? Will Spurs be linked with Nicolas Gaitan next? Or maybe Wesley Sneijder? Regardless, Everton have told everyone the defender is not for sale. Given they priced out United last year when he probably was up for grabs, we can forget this one for now unless Branthwaite kicks up a fuss.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Arsenal\nA third wheel is the last thing the Arsenal striker situation needs but here we have it in the form of the England forward. Colour us sceptical. We know the Gunners like Watkins – they made an offer in January – but they have other targets now.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nWith Nico Williams preferring to join Barcelona, the Arsenal-Rodrygo links are resurfacing, But the Brazilian is at the Club World Cup with Real Madrid and if anyone is likely to make a decisive move, it’s the Saudis.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Manchester United\nTottenham were linked with the Bournemouth attacker and now United apparently have him in their sights if Mbeumo chooses a reunion with Thomas Frank at Spurs. Eberechi Eze is also an alternative target. This is a long way from being a thing.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems we’re back in summer ’24 as the Reds are plotting a ‘shock move’ to sign Gordon as they consider replacements for Barcelona-linked Luis Diaz. If Liverpool are going to spend £100million-plus in Newcastle, it’ll be for Alexander Isak.",

      "",
      "14) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",
      "",
      "13) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "12) Oleksandr Zinchenko – Arsenal to AC Milan\nZinchenko has been surplus to requirements for some time and with a year remaining on his contract, Arsenal are motivated to sell. One problem: his fat salary is too rich for Milan’s taste. If they can overcome that obstacle, this definitely fits. Riccardo Calafiori was a Milan target too but Arsenal would prefer to keep the Italian.",
      "",
      "11) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. There is plenty of noise coming from Barca, but nothing Liverpool can take to the bank.",

      "",
      "10) 🔼 Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nThis appears to be gathering pace rather quickly. Atletico Madrid have made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nThis feels pretty likely but Arsenal are reportedly trying to hijack the transfer after Dortmund rejected a couple of Chelsea bids before the Club World Cup window closed.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, apparently, are coming around to RB Leipzig’s thinking and they were due to spend the weekend gathering their loose change with the intention of submitting a serious bid this week. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £116.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga for everyone to get very worked up about. Regardless, we are now at the point of arranging a medical, which is set for Friday, apparently. Stand by your flight trackers, Reds.",

      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs are crystallising an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United have been strongly linked with the Swedish centre-forward and a return to England from Sporting CP has seemed inevitable, even with Gyokeres sending up smoke signals trying to catch the eye of Real Madrid.",
      "Despite the prospect of a reunion with former Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, Arsenal have been the favourites to sign the 27-year-old and can wave Champions League football in his face just in case.",
      "But it appears both the club and the player have other irons in the fire. Arsenal’s apparent preference for Benjamin Sesko could leave Gyokeres disappointed, while Joao Pedro is also on the Gunners’ radar.",
      "Amid reports of Arsenal’s interest cooling as a result of Sporting’s demands, Serie A side Juventus have apparently made their play and they’re not messing about.",
      "The Bianconeri’s attacking corps includes Dusan Vlahovic, Arkadiusz Milik, Timothy Weah and Kenan Yildiz but Vlahovic and Yildiz in particular are known to be of interest to other clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres would be seen as an upgrade in any case and Juventus are reportedly putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to backing head coach Igor Tudor and equipping him with the firepower to get the club back on track.",
      "MORE ON ARSENAL FROM F365:\n👉 Arsenal ‘freeze’ deal for Viktor Gyokeres with Gunners ‘fed up’ after one ‘demand’; PL alternative named\n👉 Arsenal ‘prepare £42m’ Chelsea hijack as Gunners ‘most serious’ about transfer after top target snub\n👉 What’s going on with Gyokeres? Arsenal, Man Utd bid(s), ‘blackmail’, fake agent quotes and a ‘sales mandate’",
      "Vlahovic’s departure might be a prerequisite. Corriere dello Sport reports that Vlahovic would need to be sold for Juve to be able to afford Gyokeres.",
      "“Juventus has been anticipating the move for weeks, talking to the [player’s] entourage and even with the club, despite denials on the surface,” according to George Marota.",
      "“Obviously, it is a complex deal. It certainly is from an economic point of view: the Bianconeri, after an initial offer, have relaunched by getting closer to the boy’s wishes.”",
      "Chief among Gyokeres’ reported expectations is a colossal £11m per year in wages, the kind of income that could tempt a young man to abandon hopes of a Premier League move and keep him in hair product for a lifetime.",
      "Gyokeres joined Sporting from Coventry City in 2023 after almost firing the Sky Blues back to the top flight of English football.",
      "His scoring record in Portugal has been nothing short of absurd. Gyokeres has scored 68 goals in 66 league appearances for the Lisbon giants and six times in six starts in the Champions League.",
      "In all competitions, he’s scored 97 goals in 102 Sporting appearances. While it’s certainly possible to question how effectively a prolific scorer can apply his abilities in the Premier League or Serie A, these are numbers that cannot be ignored.",
      "If it comes down to a direct choice between Vlahovic and Gyokeres, Juventus would surely see the latter as an £11m-a-year gamble worth taking.",
      "Arsenal are in ‘advanced talks’ over signing a new striker as a fresh report has revealed sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘plan’ in an ‘unusual approach’.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",

      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for players in the modern era but this summer has been marked by transfer decisions being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid\nFinishing 19th in the 2019 Ballon d’Or vote – and collecting more career votes than Paul Scholes in the process – planted a seed in the mind of Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Zero points from his next and most recent shortlist appearance in 2022 helped crystallise a decision he would formalise three years later, dragging him kicking and screaming (in fluent Spanish) away from his Anfield home.",
      "In hindsight, publicly and proudly picking a Ballon d’Or win over becoming Liverpool captain, lifting the World Cup with England or claiming a second Champions League was the first sign for the Reds that simply being the sole Scouser in their team was not enough to sate some grandiose life goals.",
      "“I want to be the first full-back to ever do it,” he said of his Ballon d’Or ambition, adding that his desire was to be remembered as “a legend of football, someone who changed the game” with a “legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football”.",
      "Jan Kromkamp has a lot to answer for.",
      "With Michael Owen in 2001 still the only winner of the award as a Liverpool player, and Real Madrid offering a platform to more individual champions than any other club in history, it was not difficult to see where Alexander-Arnold was signalling and manoeuvring with his career crossroads on the horizon.",
      "Conducted in October 2024 at a time Alexander-Arnold was supposedly locked in negotiations with Liverpool over extending a contract due to expire in the summer, it might as well have been an exit interview.",
      "Alexander-Arnold did downplay the Ballon d’Or lure at his Real unveiling, saying he was not sure it “influenced my decision to come here at all” as “it is going to be quite hard to win the Ballon d’Or with the amount of superstars in this team”.",
      "But he also claimed to have been learning Spanish for “a few months”, and said he “grew up watching Real Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row” despite literally appearing and making the decisive mistake in one of those finals, so his status as a reliable narrator is uncertain.",
      "",
      "Rayan Cherki joining Manchester City\n“I want to win the Ballon d’Or and win the Champions League,” reads and sounds like a bold but feasible set of objectives laid out by Cherki as a new Manchester City signing.",
      "Yet that was his response to Lyon academy director Jean-Francois Vulliez when the 15-year-old was asked about what he wanted to achieve as a player, around the time Manchester United were considering an ‘unusual’ move for one of Europe’s most thrilling young talents.",
      "The Frenchman understandably never came close to enacting that plan in a solid but unspectacular Lyon side, but the Manchester City spotlight was a specific driving factor in his £30.5m summer switch.",
      "“When you see Rodri win the Ballon d’Or it is clear with Manchester City it is possible to do so and I am here for this,” he said in his first Etihad interview.",
      "Manchester City do only have as many Ballon d’Or wins as Blackpool, Dukla Prague and Ferencvaros, but you see his point.",
      "",
      "Mohamed Salah staying at Liverpool\nMany seemed to consider it an inevitability but the 2025 award was beyond Salah once his no-show across two legs of a Champions League last-16 exit to Paris Saint-Germain was completed.",
      "The Egyptian was at one stage most certainly among the favourites, but record-breaking excellence in a Premier League title win was never likely to be enough by itself.",
      "But it remains a holy grail of sorts – and a key motivation behind his decision to resist Saudi Arabia overtures and continue at Liverpool with a new contract.",
      "“It’s not in my hands, but obviously, one day I would like to win the Ballon d’Or for my people,” he said in May. “When you come from a village in Egypt, as a child, it’s difficult to dream of the Ballon d’Or. It was when I came to Liverpool that I started to think that, maybe, one day…”",
      "Salah went on to point out that “several winners in recent years have been in their 30s” so his candidacy remains strong, as “next season promises to be exciting with the defence of our title with Liverpool and the Champions League, the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and the World Cup.”",
      "Jamie Carragher will be wondering why the little dancer listed three major tournaments there alongside a jolly continent-wide gathering, but 2026 does feel like Salah’s best opportunity to round off his long catalogue of achievements.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho deciding his next steps\nVinicius Junior came second. Callum Hudson-Odoi was third. Phil Foden and Rodrygo rounded out the top five. But they all lagged behind Sancho in the running for Goal’s NXGN award, handed to the season’s best player under the age of 19.",
      "It can be an indicator of success for the transition from prodigious excellence to brilliance at a more senior level; the last two winners were Lamine Yamal and Jude Bellingham.",
      "But it can go the way of the 2021 winner, with the pressure translating to unfulfilled potential.",
      "Sancho never envisaged taking that path when he was crowned in 2019, saying: “This is not the end of it. I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or, given the likes of those who have won it previously, like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Modric and Ronaldinho.”",
      "Six years later, compulsive buyers Chelsea have paid £5m to specifically not sign him and the 25-year-old has no part to play in the Manchester United revolution.",
      "If he wants to revive those long-faded Ballon d’Or dreams, it might be a start for Sancho to drop his wage demands and secure a more permanent “freedom” arrangement.",
      "",
      "Pedri considering Manchester City\nThat Rodri win in 2024 was a watershed moment for many a player as the first Manchester City coronation, and only the second defensive-minded victor in almost three decades.",
      "“Since Rodri won it, it’s shown that a player who runs the midfield and dictates the tempo and the rhythm of the game can win a Ballon d’Or,” said compatriot Pedri, one of the standard-bearers of the next generation of midfield metronomes.",
      "“It’s always been a dream of mine to lift the Ballon d’Or,” he added in May. “But right now, there’s a month to go, and the focus is on the team – on completing the Treble, which is what really matters and once that month’s over, we’ll see if we can start talking about things like that.”",
      "The conversation sadly ended there, with Pedri powerless to stop Inter in the Champions League semi-finals before defeat to Portugal in the Nations League final. The sight of Vitinha and Joao Neves controlling the games on each of those occasions cannot have helped.",
      "But perhaps the answer is staring Pedri in the face: a British transfer record move to Manchester City to truly emulate Rodri.",
      "An actual footballer can learn a foreign language?! If you’re surprised, maybe you’re the thick one…",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",
      "Liverpool will eventually pay a British record transfer fee for Florian Wirtz while Manchester City have paid just £30.5m for Rayan Cherki.",
      "The ‘exceptional’ Club World Cup transfer window closes at 7pm on Tuesday, with a series of eye-catching possible signings including some Liverpool sales.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has given his ‘here we go’ confirmation with Man City set to complete a deal for Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki."

      "Rashford is expected to leave Man Utd during this summer’s transfer window as he is not part of Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "It was initially hoped that the appointment of Amorim would benefit Rashford, but they quickly butted heads and the England international announced his intention to leave his boyhood club ahead of January.",
      "This announcement came after Rashford was omitted from Man Utd’s squad for December’s Manchester derby, with Amorim criticising the forward and Alejandro Garnacho for their poor attitude and performances in training.",

      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m after they looked to fill the void left by Jhon Duran following his move to Al Nassr.",
      "This move benefited Rashford as he returned to form at Villa Park, grabbing six goals and four assists in his 17 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Rashford’s resurgence has caught the eye of clubs around Europe as he has more options than January, but his reported £325,000 a week salary remains an issue.",

      "‘Tottenham and Newcastle are expected to be two names to watch in the Premier League, while sources also named Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan and Saudi Pro League clubs as likely suitors. Rashford is keen to leave Man United and sources high up in the industry believe he’d now accept a pay cut to seal a move away.’",
      "Garnacho is also expected to leave Man Utd this summer as he’s been informed to ‘find a new club’ after falling out with Amorim in the final weeks of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on Garnacho’s situation, claiming his ‘first choice’ is to remain in the Premier League amid interest from Chelsea.",

      "Man United can finally complete Harry Kane transfer mission with £75m Arsenal hijack",
      "So much to unpick here. We’re fighting the urge to knock out one of those ‘bullsh*t’ coughs, but the salient point is that Sport Central Audience Writer Josh Holland absolutely knows this is nonsense. It’s just a game.",
      "He knows Harry Kane is not leaving Bayern Munich. He knows Manchester United are not signing Harry Kane. He also knows this is not remotely linked with Arsenal, but we suspect he tried and failed to crowbar Liverpool into the headline and eventually settled on the next best thing.",
      "‘Harry Kane’s place in Bayern Munich’s team could be in doubt’ is the first caption. It seems an extreme reaction to Kane’s failure to score in a 10-0 win over some Kiwi amateurs but carry on…",
      "Now 32, Kane has ended his wait for silverware at Bayern with the Bundesliga title. A return to England has been mooted in recent months and while it seems far-fetched to think of Kane walking out at Old Trafford, hear us out.",
      "Hear you out? You genuinely could not drag us away…",
      "According to respected outlet BILD, the German champions hold an interest in RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko. It’s said they view the 22-year-old as Kane’s long-term replacement and they could move for him this summer.",
      "Priced at £75m, Sesko is Arsenal’s number one target after bagging 21 goals in spite of a disappointing season for Leipzig. Surprisingly, the report adds that should Sesko be signed, Bayern would bring Kane back into the number 10 role with his tendency to drop deep complimenting that.",
      "Sesko to the Allianz Arena has work to do with Arsenal claiming to ‘hold the upper hand’ but Bayern’s pull in Germany is telling. If a move did materialise, it’s not yet clear whether Kane would be happy with being moving away from centre-forward.",
      "Step forward, Jason Wilcox.",
      "So if we’re following this correctly, Bayern buying Sesko (that’s the ‘Arsenal hijack’) could directly lead to Kane entirely deciding to f*** off Champions League football and the possibility of more silverware, to join a really sh*t Manchester United. And that’s supposing Bayern would be remotely open to selling a player who has scored an extraordinary 62 goals in 63 Bundesliga games.",
      "The pay-off paragraph is a thing of great wonder…",
      "Whether United would entertain the prospect of signing Kane, or whether the England international would be open to returning to England. However, if Bayern do pull off a deal for Sesko, it would be the perfect green light for United to swoop in and bring in the ready-made goalscorer needed.",
      "The first sentence makes literally no sense. But you simply cannot argue with the second. And that’s that. Deal done. Done deal.",
      "",
      "Two strikers? Two strikers?!\n‘Arsenal are staging their own “beauty pageant” as they are actively pursuing deals for both Viktor Gyokeres AND Benjamin Sesko,’ writes John Cross on the back page of the Daily Mirror. The ‘AND’ in capitals indicates that we are supposed to be surprised.",

      "It’s almost like Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta is acting like every other sporting director in world football.",
      "Who amongst us thought that clubs had a list of targets but refused to work on the second name on the list until the first became an impossibility? John Cross, perhaps.",
      "Indeed, on June 2, the BBC‘s Sami Mokbel wrote: ‘So in terms of Gyokeres or Sesko – my information is that the club are working towards confirming the frameworks of both deals before making a final decision on which to proceed with.’",
      "Both players have been consistently linked with Arsenal over the last month and yet suddenly, the Daily Mirror have delivered this as back-page news, allowing their Chief Football Writer to deliver this claim as some kind of scoop.",
      "Just wait until he spots that Sesko will actually join Bayern Munich, leaving Harry Kane with almost no choice but to join Manchester United…",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ivan Toney became the 35th and 36th players to be capped while playing for foreign clubs.",

      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho leaving Manchester United to reunite with a former boss will be “complicated.”",

      "Following that, on the Red Devils’ post-season tour of Southeast Asia, Ruben Amorim reportedly told him: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It has since been reported that the United boss has weakened the club’s negotiating position, as sides are aware he wants rid of Garnacho, so won’t pay the asking price, aware the Manchester outfit will probably accept less than they’d initially hoped for.",

      "He said on X that Garnacho’s ‘priority is to remain in the Premier League,’ while he’s expected to leave United. Despite Leverkusen’s ‘interest and and Ten Hag’s appreciation, the deal looks complicated’.",
      "It has previously been suggested that Chelsea is the United man’s preferred destination. Indeed, he has reportedly told his agent to make it clear that he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge this summer.",
      "But Romano has reported there’s not a massively high chance that move goes through. He recently stated there is a ’35 per cent chance’ that Garnacho does move to the Blues.",
      "In the same report, he suggested the United man ‘could stay in the Premier League’.",
      "Indeed, that is his preference, but if no clubs in England make an offer, but sides elsewhere offer United what they want, it seems they will waste no time in getting Garnacho off the books.",
      "Whether that is Leverkusen remains to be seen, as the likes of Napoli, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with the Argentine, too.",

      "Here are 10 top stoppers we think might be gettable…",
      "",
      "10) Gianluigi Donnarumma (PSG)\nDonnarumma’s agent will have you believe the Italy keeper is available because he needs more leverage on contract talks with PSG, who want to keep their current custodian, but not at any cost.",
      "Of course, Manchester United’s name has been mentioned because that’s the oldest trick in the agents’ book, but Donnarumma himself said his priority is to renew with PSG. But only if he gets paid.",
      "",
      "9) Nick Pope (Newcastle)\nEddie Howe clearly isn’t entirely convinced by Pope given he’s trying again to sign James Trafford from Burnley. Newcastle want us to believe that Trafford would be arriving to compete for the No.1 position, but the new boy is not likely to make that move at this point in his career without a certain level of assurance. Which suggests Pope’s days as first choice are numbered; there would be considerable interest from other Premier League clubs in need of an experienced England international.",
      "",
      "8) Mads Hermansen (Leicester)\nThe 25-year-old keeper was one of very few to emerge with a smidgen of credit from a miserable season at the King Power. At least the Dane had ample opportunity to show what he can do – only Ipswich and Southampton allowed more shots on their goal.",
      "Before demonstrating that he could stay at the highest level while Leicester return to the Championship, Hermansen played a big role in the Foxes’ promotion to the Premier League. Brentford were linked before they found a bargain in Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "",
      "7) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton)\nRamsdale’s move to Southampton last summer made you wonder if the England keeper actually enjoys being relegated. Were there really no other better offers? Perhaps not, given the daft sod once openly admitted to struggling with concentration, but when his mind is on the job, Ramsdale remains a very good keeper. West Ham were sniffing and he feels like a good fit for Leeds.",
      "💷 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever: Chelsea shamed but Arsenal evolution clear",

      "The 6ft 6in giant, who began his career at Chelsea and went via PSG to Nice, has been catching eyes across Europe, and obviously Manchester United have been linked. But the Red Devils will have to wait until January since UEFA banned them doing any business with INEOS stable mate Nice until after this summer window.",
      "",
      "5) Vanja Milinkovic-Savic (Torino)\nThe Serbian stopper began his career as a youth player at Manchester United and he has been linked with a move to Old Trafford – maybe we should just assume that to be the case for all these keepers unless stated – after three solid seasons in Torino’s sticks. AC Milan, though, seem to be the frontrunners, with an agreement in place to pay the 28-year-old’s £17million release clause if they lose Mike Maignan.",
      "Only two keepers in Europe’s top five leagues performed better in relation to their expected goals against than Milinkovic-Savic, who conceded 11.4 goals fewer than the algorithms expected him to.",
      "",
      "4) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nWidely proclaimed as the best goalkeeper in the world but, more accurately in our view, he was the goalkeeper for the best team in the world. Argentina, that is, not Villa. That doesn’t mean he isn’t very, very good, and he would be an asset to any team looking for a stopper this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been linked, and he’d certainly be an upgrade, but Villa don’t have to give him away, even if they are the club in most PSR peril.",
      "",
      "3) Lucas Chevalier (Lille)\nIf Villa sell Martinez, then Chevalier is said to be high on their list of potential replacements. Though that plan could be scuppered by PSG if they can’t reach an agreement with Donnarumma and sell the Italy keeper to a club more willing to meet his massive wage demands.",
      "At 23, Chevalier conceded 7.3 goals fewer than xG suggests he should last season, with Manchester City said to be keen on the France call-up.",
      "",
      "2) Andriy Lunin (Real Madrid)\nIt seems Lunin is open to exploring his options away from Real’s bench because we have to assume he’s given up on ever replacing Thibaut Courtois as No.1. The penny should have dropped when Courtous returned from injury for the 2024 Champions League final when Lunin had played most of the season.",

      "The second part of the summer transfer window has reopened - and there is still more business to be done before it closes on September 1.",
      "Few knew what to expect from the special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it delivered 10 days of transfer drama and has now set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer.",
      "Manchester City were the big spenders after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on the first window's Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of AC Milan goalkeeper Maignan and ran out of time to conclude a deal for Dortmund forward Gittens.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he left Dortmund's training ground as Deadline Day drew to a close.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Other deals were announced in between windows, with Mathys Tel completing a £30m permanent move to Spurs and Leeds signing Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg on an initial two-year deal.",
      "Premier League clubs splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "City were the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side looked to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, having spent a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides have yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to United has been the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Dortmund for £32m and City also sold Yan Couto to the Bundesliga club for £25m.",

      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left winger is another priority, with Real's Rodrygo among the list of targets. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the Spaniard's £5m release clause.",

      "The Reds have, though, lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit, with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong.",

      "United were unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees have turned down their opening £55m bid, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the Cameroon forward, valued at more than £60m.",
      "However, Tottenham have now held initial discussions with Brentford about a deal for Mbeumo, who is more intrigued in a Spurs move now that Thomas Frank has been appointed head coach, although the player is still understood to be leaning towards United, who are expected to go back in with a fresh offer for the for the 25-year-old.",
      "Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker. Gyokeres is one of their targets up front and approaches have been made for the Sporting frontman through intermediaries, although recent reports in Portugal claim the player would prefer a move to Arsenal.",
      "United have also entered the race for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike - who is also interesting Liverpool and Chelsea - according to Sky in Germany. However, it will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan, but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "United's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad having appointed Thomas Frank to replace the sacked Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south-coast club.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "Man Utd have made an initial approach for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres through intermediaries, with Ruben Amorim a big admirer of his former striker; Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games last season; United also expected to bid again for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Tuesday 10 June 2025 09:42, UK",
      "United are exploring the conditions of a potential deal for the 27-year-old. Head coach Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Gyokeres having managed him at Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres has a gentleman's agreement to leave Sporting this summer for offers above £58m (€70m) despite a release clause of around £84m (€100m).",
      "Gyokeres scored 54 goals in 52 games this past season for the Portuguese champions, including a hat-trick against Man City in the Champions League, having scored 43 in 50 in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",
      "The club are expected to go back in with an improved offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo after having their first bid rejected, and they remain optimistic a deal can be struck.",
      "There are reports suggesting Thomas Frank will try and tempt Mbeumo to go to Tottenham Hotspur if he takes over as their new head coach, wowever it's understood the player wants to join United.",
      "Man Utd saw their opening bid of £55m rejected. The offer consisted of a guaranteed £45m plus £10m in bonuses.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",

      "Go back further and the contrast is even more stark. Transfermarkt valued him at only £450,000 when he agreed to join Brighton from Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in late 2017. He was valued at only £830,000 when he turned his loan to Coventry permanent in 2021.",
      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",
      "Two years and 97 goals later, Gyokeres holds added appeal to suitors such as Manchester United given he is thought to be available for considerably less than his current £75m valuation.",
      "Despite having an £84m release clause in his contract, Gyokeres struck a gentleman's agreement with Sporting last year that he would be allowed to leave this summer for offers worth £59m.",
      "A report in Portuguese outlet Record claims Sporting president Federico Varandas has increased the asking price to £68m following enquiries, leaving Gyokeres \"furious\", but even at that price he would represent good value, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Gyokeres's scoring record speaks for itself and a deeper look at his numbers, compared to those of other strikers across the top seven European leagues, underlines just how good he was last season.",
      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",
