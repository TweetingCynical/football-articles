      "Sir Alex Ferguson has always had faith in Marcus Rashford's ability to shine at Manchester United, despite the striker's well-documented issues with Ruben Amorim. The legendary Fergie, who turns 84 on Wednesday, has long been an admirer of Rashford and doesn't need any convincing of his talent.",
      "The 28-year-old has been showcasing his skills at Barcelona this season following a high-profile falling out with current United manager Amorim. After being loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of last season, Rashford moved to Spain with the aim of reviving his form.",
      "He has certainly achieved that, netting seven goals and providing 11 assists for Hansi Flick's team. However, the England star's long-term future at Barcelona remains uncertain due to wage disputes.",
      "Spanish publication El Nacional previously reported that Rashford is unwilling to take a pay cut if he makes a permanent move to the LaLiga heavyweights. The forward agreed to a 25% salary reduction when he joined Barca in the summer, which reportedly sees him pocketing £12.1million a year.",
      "However, fellow Spanish outlet Sport has now suggested that a breakthrough has been made, with the talented forward open to discussing a wage decrease to fit within the club's salary cap. The U-turn is likely to disappoint Ferguson, who has always maintained that Rashford possessed the potential to achieve greatness at Old Trafford.",
      "The Telegraph reported that the legendary Scot told his closest sources that he'd envisaged managing the England international at United and stressed the importance of deploying Rashford's talents to maximise the squad's overall performance.",
      "The revered manager was also convinced he could unlock Rashford's optimal role if given the opportunity to work alongside him, acknowledging that many coaches mistakenly deploy the star in unsuitable positions.",
      "Following United's 2023 Carabao Cup triumph, Ferguson was emphatic that the forward delivers his most impressive performances operating off the left rather than centrally as a traditional number nine.",
      "He said: \"Well I don't think he's a striker. He operates from the left hand side which is fantastic. His finishing is always good, keeps his shots down which is really important.",
      "\"He's in a great vein of form and unfortunately for us he's the main source of goals, we could do with an extra one. But he's doing it.\"",
      "Fergie has also hailed Rashford's charitable endeavours after the star collected the Football Writers' Association Tribute award for his campaign against child food poverty. The former United boss heaped praise on Rashford's humanitarian efforts, even pledging up to £2million in matching contributions for the FareShare charity.",
      "Congratulating Rashford at the awards ceremony in 2021, Ferguson said: \"I would like to congratulate Marcus on his achievement and presentation (of the FWA Tribute Award) tonight. I have known him since being a kid of seven years of age, and seen him develop through the ranks of Manchester United into a truly wonderful person.",
      "\"Apart from his football life, what he has achieved in the last few months is quite astonishing, how he has helped the people in need is a truly amazing achievement. I would like to congratulate him on that. He has shown to young people in particular there is a different way of dealing with life.",
      "\"He has shown great humility, he has shown courage to do what he did, so this achievement is well deserved and should be recognised with what he has done. So Marcus, well done on a fantastic achievement.\"",
      "\"I wasn't nervous, I was just excited. That is the feeling that we got anyway being in and around the first-team, maybe passing them in the corridors, just small stuff like that, it builds your excitement and your hunger really.",
      "\"It's like a reminder that is where you want to get to and that's why a lot of players have come through during his [Ferguson] reign as manager and even now.\"",
      "Rashford has openly expressed his desire to have been managed by Ferguson, calling it his ultimate footballing ambition. Speaking about his respect for the legendary boss in 2021, he said: \"For me it was an unbelievable experience and I think for me that is probably the only regret I have ever had in my career, never having the chance to play under Sir Alex.",
      "\"It is something which will probably never going to happen now, but to be on the phone to him and just have 10 or 15 minutes conversation with him was amazing and I am pleased he was aware of the situation and he wanted to help as well, so it was brilliant.\"",
      "Given the mutual admiration between these two United legends, there's little doubt Ferguson could have unlocked Rashford's full potential had he been in charge today. However, that challenge now falls to Amorim, who must weigh up whether to persist with or move on from the homegrown talent should he make his way back to Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lisandro Martinez was left fuming after Manchester United were held by Wolves at Old Trafford and told his beleaguered team-mates that they \"have to win when they play at home\".",
      "The visitors were winless in their 18 games and had lost all but two of those, leaving them doomed at the bottom of the table. But they were able to take their points tally from two to three by earning a share of the spoils in Manchester, despite going behind in the first-half.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had put the Red Devils in front but Ladislav Krejci silenced the home crowd when he scored to earn Wolves' first point since October. Come full-time the Manchester outfit were booed off after an abject performance.",
      "It halts any momentum the team were gaining and whilst Martinez believes Wolves' position at the bottom is not a fair reflection of their quality, he insists United cannot be letting such games pass them by on their own patch.",
      "He said: \"Really disappointed. We can't come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it's our responsibility. We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn't press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving round and creating spaces.",
      "\"Wolves don't deserve the place they are, it's a strong team. We respect them. We have to take more risks. The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and accept it and go for the next one.\"",
      "Had Ruben Amorim's side won then they would've leaped into the top four ahead of Liverpool, at least momentarily, but instead they remain in sixth. Gary Neville was critical of the team's set-up from minute one and claimed it was on the head coach to take responsibility.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year tenure at Manchester United was not without its mistakes, with the legendary Scot acknowledging one of his most significant blunders. Jaap Stam, the towering Dutchman, was considered one of the world's best centre-backs around the turn of the century and was a formidable presence in the Red Devils' defence.",
      "However, after a major falling out with Ferguson, Stam was swiftly transferred to Lazio in Serie A, ending his three-year stint at Old Trafford. Their relationship reached a breaking point at a petrol station, where the Dutch defender's fate was decided.",
      "Stam had crossed a line by including several controversial comments in his 2001 autobiography, 'Head to Head'. Not only did he suggest that Ferguson had \"tapped him up\" when signing from PSV Eindhoven in 1998, he also claimed that the Scot actively encouraged United players to dive during matches.",
      "Stam revealed: \"It's got to the stage where he has even told us, 'Don't try and stay on your feet if you're in the box and get a slight kick.' He wants us to copy other sides we face in European competitions and go down to win a penalty.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, the revelations didn't sit well with Ferguson, who turns 84 on New Year's Eve. He was so furious about the entire affair that he dropped him from United's starting line-up for a trip to Aston Villa before promptly arranging to sell him to Lazio at the first available chance.",
      "In the days leading up to the transfer, tensions reached boiling point, with Stam walking out of training and making his views clear to his manager. Ferguson then tracked him down at a petrol station before telling him his Old Trafford days were finished.",
      "\"One morning, I told him what I thought and left the training ground on the spot,\" Stam later revealed. \"On the way home I received a phone call in my car from Fergie's secretary.",
      "\"She said that he wanted to speak to me. He came on the phone straightaway. Ferguson said, 'Where are you?' I said, 'Close to my house, at a petrol station.' Ferguson said, 'Wait there!' He jumped in his car and came straight to me.",
      "\"At the petrol station he parked his car and got in with me. He told me that I had to be transferred. Then he said, 'Will you please move to Lazio quickly?' I agreed to do it. Right there and then.",
      "\"One quick conversation in my car at a petrol station in Manchester was enough for me to leave that big club. When I think about it now, and I have never talked about it before, I find it unbelievable I let that, as a player, happen to me.\"",
      "Within a day, Stam had jetted off to Rome to join Lazio. Ferguson then put his trust in the up-and-coming Wes Brown and seasoned pro Laurent Blanc, who was quickly signed as Stam's replacement.",
      "Ferguson later expressed regret over his handling of the Stam situation, admitting he made an error in pushing the defender out of the club. He said in 2013: \"When I think of disappointments, obviously Jaap Stam was always a disappointment to me. I made a bad decision there.\"",
      "Gary Neville admitted last year that it caught him off guard, saying on the Stick to Football podcast: \"Jaap was the biggest one where I felt at the time that it was questionable. And the boss has said it was his biggest mistake, hasn't he, in his book?",
      "\"That was the one where I look at that transfer and think, 'He's the best centre back in the world. No one's beating him. No one's beating Jaap Stam!'\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson earned plenty of praise for his transfer dealings at Manchester United but even the legendary boss got it wrong on occasion. The iconic manager, who turns 84 on Wednesday, once branded midfielder Owen Hargreaves' spell at Old Trafford as \"a disaster\".",
      "The England international joined United from Bayern Munich in 2007. The £17million signing had secured four Bundesliga titles and lifted the Champions League during his spell at the German giants, while Hargreaves had also won plaudits with standout displays at the 2006 World Cup.",
      "A defensive midfielder, he was seen as a potential replacement for Roy Keane and showed early promise. Hargreaves featured 34 times in his first campaign as Ferguson's men captured a Premier League and Champions League double, even scoring his spot-kick in the dramatic penalty shootout triumph over Chelsea.",
      "However, his luck soon turned, with recurring patellar tendinitis keeping him out of action and effectively finishing his career. Hargreaves would manage just five more outings across the following three campaigns, prompting Ferguson to name him among his biggest disappointments.",
      "In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt.",
      "\"I didn't feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern. I met Owen's agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United.",
      "\"It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever. He didn't show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking.",
      "\"I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "\"I rang him, when I heard,\" Hargreaves said in 2021. \"I was surprised myself. My family were really surprised.",
      "\"I think anyone who's been around me knows that I left home at 15 alone, to go to a country where I couldn't speak the language to play football. I left the comfort of Bayern to play for Man United, because I wanted to represent Man United, to play for Sir Alex and be part of that great team.",
      "\"I never took the easy step. I played for a country I wasn't even born in because I wanted to be the best. I probably never should have been a professional football player, based on my start! But I worked my way and, obviously, didn't finish the way I wanted. A lot of things went into that.\"",
      "He added: \"As much as it was disappointing for him not having me play - because when I was fit, he played me all the time. I told him on the phone, I promised him, it broke me more than it did him. Because that was my career.",
      "\"To this day, I haven't done a day of sport since. I can't because of my knee. If you just forget the football side, my career changed from one day to the next and for a young man chasing a ball around all of his life, it was a pretty significant day. I haven't been able to play sport like that since. To say it went the way I envisioned would be a lie.\"",

      "To Manchester United fans, Sir Alex Ferguson has always been a figure of strength and resilience. Yet the period since his retirement in 2013 has pushed the iconic manager through trials that football never managed to inflict.",
      "The first major turning point came in May 2018, when he was struck by a sudden brain haemorrhage that demanded emergency, life-saving surgery. While in hospital, Sir Alex found himself asking \"how many sunny days I would see again\".",
      "Given the circumstances, his pessimism was understandable. Medical staff believed that his chances of survival upon arrival at Salford Royal Hospital were only 20 per cent.",
      "\"There were five brain haemorrhages that day,\" Ferguson, then aged 79, said in the 2021 documentary 'Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In'. \"Three died. Two survived. You know you are lucky.",
      "\"It was a beautiful day, I remember that. I wondered how many sunny days I would ever see again. I found that difficult.\"",
      "Early in his recovery, the 13-time Premier League champion worried that he might permanently lose his memory after a setback that left him unable to speak properly. \"I was trying to force it out but I couldn't get it out,\" he explained. \"One of the doctors came in and I was crying because I felt helpless.\"",
      "Looking back on the moment he collapsed at home, Ferguson confessed that feelings of \"loneliness\" and the fear of death entered his thoughts. \"The moments when you are on your own, there is that fear and loneliness that creeps into your mind,\" he said. \"You don't want to die. That is where I was at. These things did flash through my mind quite a lot.\"",
      "Although Ferguson eventually recovered fully, the years that followed brought significant changes to his personal life. Towards the end of 2023, Sir Alex was devastated by the death of his wife of 57 years, Lady Cathy, whom he often described as the \"bedrock\" of his life.",
      "He has also said she was the only person he never answered back to - a remarkable admission from a man famous for unleashing fearsome 'hairdryer treatments' on underperforming players.",
      "The couple first met in 1964 while working at a typewriter factory and married two years later. Cathy went on to have a crucial influence on Ferguson's career, offering stability and support while also shaping key moments, including persuading him to reverse his decision to retire in 2002.",
      "Following her death, Sir Alex acknowledged that he had \"struggled to leave the house.\" Consumed by grief, he opted to spend time travelling to distract himself, visiting destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Bahrain.",
      "After returning home, he joined a dementia support group and later decided to sell his £3.25million Cheshire home, where he and Cathy had lived since 2010. Sir Alex now resides in the village of Goostrey, near Knutsford, living next door to his son Darren.",
      "Since stepping away from management, Manchester United has remained a constant presence in Ferguson's life. The legendary Scot continues to attend matches regularly, often watching from the directors' box.",
      "However, his paid role as a club ambassador was ended last year as part of wide-ranging cost-cutting measures introduced by owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The INEOS chairman, who bought a 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club in February 2024, has overseen hundreds of redundancies at United.",
      "Ferguson had reportedly been earning £2m annually and while he was described as \"grumpy\" by Ratcliffe when told the position would end, he ultimately responded with dignity. \"I take my hat off to Alex,\" Sir Jim said in March.",
      "\"I sat down with Alex, just the two of us in the room. And I said, 'Look, the club isn't where you may think it is. It is spending more than it's earning and we're going to finish up in some difficulties. Honestly, we can't really afford to continue to pay you £2m a year.'",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to leave it with you, let you have a think about it.' It was very grown up. Maybe a little bit grumpy at the beginning, but he got it. He came back three days later, after talking to his son and said, 'Fine, I'm going to step away from it. My decision.'\"",
      "He continued: \"I think it reflects really well on Alex because he put the club before himself.\"",
      "For someone whose identity was forged through authority, dominance and constant success, the hardships of recent years have exposed another side of Sir Alex Ferguson - one defined by vulnerability, humility and quiet resolve.",
      "The game once bent to his will, but illness, bereavement and upheaval have required a different resilience altogether. To countless fans, Ferguson will always be the indomitable force on the touchline. But perhaps his greatest victories have come away from the spotlight - in survival, in love and in learning to let go.",

      "Cole quickly made his mark at Old Trafford, forming a lethal partnership with Dwight Yorke that powered United to their historic 1999 treble. That year, Cole netted 24 times across all competitions, while Yorke bagged 29.",
      "The 54-year-old hung up his boots in 2008, but post-retirement life has been marred by health troubles. A decade ago, he suffered kidney failure after picking up an unidentified virus during a trip to Vietnam.",
      "His condition deteriorated to such an extent that he required a kidney transplant in 2017. Fortunately, his nephew was a match and the operation was successful. Despite this, Cole continues to grapple with his health issue and has now offered a heartfelt glimpse into how it impacts him.",

      "\"I had around two years of questioning myself. Then in that time, I felt ill a few more times and I've actually turned around and said to myself, 'Sod it. Get on with it.'",
      "\"I was backed so much by a lot of my former team-mates saying, 'Come on. We know what you're like. We know mentally you're strong.' You've got to realise you can't be stubborn anymore.",
      "\"I mean, what will be will be, you know? Just live your life, enjoy what you've got left. That's the way I try and view things now. Ultimately, with the illness every now and then it's gonna be a struggle. Just gotta ride it out.",

      "There are set to be big changes at Manchester United heading into 2026. Ruben Amorim has been at the helm for over a year now, and his team have put in some solid performances so far this season.",
      "There was a plethora of new arrivals in the summer transfer window, with Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo just some of the players coming through the door.",
      "And it seems there will be even more activity in the January window. Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, and Casemiro have all been linked with moves away from the club and could secure deals in the coming weeks.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are keen on bringing back Scott McTominay to Old Trafford. The Napoli midfielder left the club in the summer last year and has been thriving in Italy alongside United player Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Scotland international helped Antonio Conte's side win the Serie A last season, and he has gone on to become one of the leading midfielders in European football.",
      "Napoli would obviously prefer to keep McTominay, but according to reports, they would be willing to listen to offers in the region of £60m.",
      "Not only has McTominay been a great player for Napoli, but he was also awarded the Serie A Player of the Year award thanks to his contributions in their title-winning season.",
      "With Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and potentially even Bruno Fernandes heading for the exit in 2026, re-acquiring the services of McTominay would be a smart move.",
      "United have confirmed the signing of Lea Schuller from Bayern Munich. She has signed a contract until summer 2029 and will officially join on January 1. She has scored more than 100 goals for the German heavyweights and has bagged 54 goals in 82 international games.",
      "Matt Johnson, Director of Women’s Football at Manchester United, said: \"Lea's goalscoring record is phenomenal, her style of play will give our attack an exciting new dimension. We are delighted to add a player of her pedigree to the group.",
      "\"Lea’s winning mentality and experience will really help our young and ambitious team as we continue to grow together and compete across domestic and European competitions.\"",
      "\"From the first conversations that I had with Marc and the club, the ambitions of everyone here were very clear. I still have so much that I want to achieve in my career, and I know that Manchester United is the perfect club to join.",
      "\"I feel that the team’s style of football will really suit my game, I hope my qualities and experience can help us to achieve our aims both in England and in the Champions League.\"",

      "Senne Lammens' agent has claimed that Manchester United originally planned to retain Andre Onana at Old Trafford to mentor the Belgian shot-stopper. Lammens joined United this summer in an £18.2million deal, with additional clauses, from Belgian Pro League outfit Royal Antwerp.",
      "The goalkeeper penned a five-year deal after breakthrough talks before making the journey to Manchester to complete his switch on deadline day. The 23-year-old is considered amongst Europe's most promising young keepers and has largely made a positive impression under Ruben Amorim thus far.",
      "Although he has managed only two clean sheets, the stopper has provided a reliable figure for United's backline, which has been frequently shuffled due to form and fitness issues this campaign.",
      "Speaking to Belgian outlet HBVL, Lammens' representative Mark Volders has discussed his client's switch to Amorim's squad whilst suggesting the club altered their strategy regarding Onana. The Cameroon international departed United on loan to Turkish Super Lig outfit Trabzonspor shortly after Lammens' arrival in M16.",
      "\"Those critical voices... the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez,\" Volders said.",
      "\"But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust.",
      "\"Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Lammens has recently confessed to being \"surprised\" by the camaraderie and unity within United's dressing room since his arrival.",
      "The goalkeeper spoke with Malaysian broadcaster Stadium Astro during an interview at Carrington, where he was quizzed about his closest relationships in the squad. Lammens mentioned two fellow shot-stoppers but revealed he feels connected to the entire group due to their strong bond.",
      "He said: \"I would say maybe Tom Heaton or the fourth goalkeeper Dermot Mee or also, like, the Dutch guys, because it's easier with the language as well. But I think just in general that's what surprised me the most.",
      "\"It's just the togetherness of the group and of the dressing room. Everyone was really nice. So I don't really want to say one or two guys. It's in general with everybody, to be honest.\"",
      "Lammens offered additional personal details when he disclosed that he keeps a journal before and after fixtures. He added: \"I think it started when I started played at Antwerp two years ago.",
      "\"I like to write things down before and after a game just to get my head into the right mindset. Sometimes if things don't go right, or you don't want it in your head, you just write it down to get it off your chest.",
      "\"I came up with it [journaling] a little bit myself, but also got it [the idea] from people talking about it as well, so I thought I would give it a try and it actually helped me a lot, so I still do it.",
      "\"Before a game, I write down a little bit about the opponent, about how they will play and put pressure on me. Also individual things, like key points I have to remember throughout the game.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why Joshua Zirkzee was substituted at half-time in Tuesday night's disappointing Premier League draw against Wolves. The striker had put United ahead with a deflected effort before the visitors levelled in injury time.",
      "Zirkzee came into the starting line-up in place of Mason Mount following the Boxing Day win over Newcastle United. Mount missed the game against Wolves after picking up a \"small\" injury.",
      "After half-time, Zirkzee did not come back out with his teammates and was replaced by academy star Jack Fletcher. United dropped points against the Premier League's bottom team after Patrick Dorgu had a goal disallowed and Benjamin Sesko came close.",
      "\"Point toward injuries, AFCON, but I think every team is in a similar situation. I am not quite sure what happened with him (Zirkzee). If he was injured, fair enough, if he wasn't, it's a bizarre substitution to make.\"",
      "Following another disappointing evening at Old Trafford, Amorim was asked why the Netherlands international was taken off. Surprisingly, the United boss didn't mention any sign of a potential injury.",
      "\"We were running around and trying to recover the ball,\" he explained. \"They overload with a lot of midfielders and we were struggling with that. Sometimes you can attack better with less strikers. We played with three strikers. Cunha, Josh and Ben are three strikers and sometimes it's not the best time to attack well.\"",
      "Zirkzee put the home side in front after a nice turn on the edge of the box and a stroke of luck through a deflection in the 27th minute. However, Wolves levelled shortly before half-time through a Ladislav Krejci header and survived a mini scare when Dorgu's late goal was chalked off to claim a well-earned point.",
      "Amorim laid the blame for the disappointing result on United's lack of creativity, with Wolves comfortable over the course of the match and deserving of a share of the spoils.",
      "Adding on the draw, the United boss said: \"We struggled in the game. We had a lack of creation. We knew it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game, also. If you look at the 90 minutes, we had our chances, but the fluidity that we had, especially offensively, wasn't there because there is a lack of connections in this moment.",
      "\"It's a completely different game [to Newcastle]. We had more men behind the ball and when you do, you have to work harder to get the ball, to get imagination.",
      "\"We lacked that quality today. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball, you struggle without the ball. We need to recover and go to the next one.\"",
      "The result leaves United in sixth place, two points behind Liverpool in fourth, with one more game played and a staggering 15 points away from table toppers Arsenal.",

      "Christmas is a time for miracles - and Wolves almost produced one at Old Trafford. But even though the Premier League's rock-bottom side couldn't break their season's duck with a win - it didn't stop Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim from spitting feathers.",
      "Somehow it felt fitting that United ended 2025 by failing to beat the worst team in the top flight. And on this evidence, there is little to suggest 2026 will be much better for a United side which has become the masters of being predictably unpredictable.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had fired United ahead, when his deflected shot beat Jose Sa on 27 minutes. But the visitors stunned Old Trafford with a shock equaliser from Ladislav Krejci on the stroke of half time. And it took a sensational double save from Senne Lammens to deny Krejci and then Yerson Mosquera from securing a win for Wolves that would have been as rare as a visit from Santa Clause himself.",
      "United had headed into this clash with a host of leading lights missing, due to a combination of injuries and the African Cup of Nations. But despite Amorim having to field a weakened team, it was difficult to see anything other than a home win.",
      "That's because Wolves were the visitors. A team with just two points to their name this season and rock bottom of the table, 16 points from safety. A side which had lost 25 league games this year, one short of matching the most ever in a calendar year, a record set by Ipswich Town in 1994.",
      "But Wolves were the better team in the first half and didn't deserve to go behind. But Jose Sa was left with no chance when Zirkzee's shot deflected off the stomach of Krejci, to see the Dutchman score his first league goal on this ground in more than 12 months.",
      "Given Wolves' track record, the outcome from here felt inevitable. But the visitors started to threaten and created chances which Tolu Arokodare and Hugo Bueno both missed. Yet the equaliser Wolves deserved came on the stroke of half time, when Krejci arrived at the back post to send a downward header past the outstretched hand of Lammens.",
      "United were booed off - and Amorim looked furious. His mood wasn't helped when Sa somehow clawed out a header towards his own goal from Mosquera. While Jhon Arias saw a powerful effort whistle just wide at the opposite end, as the visitors sensed a famous triumph.",
      "Wolves looked the more likely winners, only for Lammens to ride to United's rescue. To tone down the shade of red Amorim and his flops were left with on their glum-looking faces.",

      "Manchester United handed Wolves their third point of the season on another disappointing evening at Old Trafford.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had given the Red Devils the lead midway through the first half with a deflected effort. But Ladislav Krejčí equalised for Wolves moments before the break with an eye-catching header.",
      "The visitors were the better side throughout the majority of the game, with United struggling to find fluency in attack. Patrick Dorgu thought he had secured victory late on, only to see his celebrations cut short by the linesman's flag.",
      "The point leaves the Red Devils sixth in the table, while Wolves continue to prop up the table. Here are all of the talking points from Old Trafford:",
      "It really wasn't a performance to write home about from United in the first-half, with Wolves having the majority of the play. But given their poor fortune this season, it was only a matter of time until the hosts took the lead and that's exactly what happened.",
      "Ayden Heaven did excellently to steal the ball back for the Red Devils and looked to play Zirkzee through. Wolves managed to get a few bodies behind the ball but that only served to obscure Jose Sa's view as Zirkzee's effort took a wicked deflection and bounced into the back of the net.",
      "Senne Lammens had proven to be the only barrier between Wolves and an equaliser at Old Trafford before the break. Hugo Bueno went close from a flowing move, only to be denied by the Belgian stopper.",
      "But he was powerless to stop Ladislav Krejčí from levelling. After the hosts failed to deal with a corner, the Czech netted expertly with a brilliant header to deservedly see Wolves head into the break on level terms.",
      "Every point and every goal appears to be priceless for Wolves right now. The only issue is that they can't stop giving them away.",
      "And they almost scored one of the great Premier League own goals shortly before the hour. From a long ball, Yerson Mosquera nodded back to his goalkeeper, only to see the ball head towards the net.",
      "Fortunately for him, Sa just about got back in time to claw it off of the line.",
      "After what was arguably their most accomplished performance of the season last time out against Newcastle, boss Ruben Amorim bizarrely elected to change his system. After selecting a back three against the Magpies, United reverted to type this time around in the Portuguese coach's preferred 3-4-3.",
      "And once again, it seemed to hamper the Red Devils who were lacking fluency and throughout the 90 minutes. Up against a better side, they'd surely have been punished.",
      "Just as though it looked like both sides would claim a point, Old Trafford was sent into raptures. Sesko's effort was well saved by Sa, but the Portuguese only served to parry it to Dorgu, who fired high into the roof of the net.",
      "Fortunately for Wolves, the offside flag came to their rescue - a decision that VAR agreed with. It would certainly have been another cruel way to lose a game for the Midlands side.",
      "Finally, Wolves have three points. Finally, Rob Edwards has his first point as manager.",
      "There's no getting away from it, it's been an utterly rotten season for Wolves. But their display at Old Trafford was no doubt among their best of the campaign.",
      "Of course, the bar isn't particularly high at the moment and they still need a miracle to see them retain their place in the Premier League but at least the side have finally given their fans something to celebrate.",

Amorim changed his tactics from the win over Newcastle and was made to pay as the league's bottom club held them to a point.",
      "The United boss changed his tactic in the Boxing Day win over Newcastle for the first time in his 13 months in charge. After persisting with a 3-4-3 system at United, Amorim switched to a 4-2-3-1 in the victory over Newcastle. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad at AFCON and Bruno Fernandes out with an injury, the United boss utilised his squad with a surprising tweak.",
      "Patrick Dorgu moved to the right wing, scoring the winner, with Luke Shaw returning to left-back after becoming a regular at left centre-back. However, against Wolves, Amorim was forced to change his starting 11 with Mason Mount injured and Joshua Zirkzee starting in his place.",
      "\"So I think I've watched enough United over this last five or six weeks. I've watched six out of their last seven games to know what looks right and what isn't right and I'm really surprised.",

      "\"The performances have been so much better in these last two or three games through the tweaks that have been made but he's gone back tonight to his 3-4-3 but the problem is he has got players in the system.",
      "\"Zirkzee on this right channel, obviously he's going central now. Dalot over here, having to come back all the time, it's not right. They're playing against a team tonight that are struggling so could win and get away with it but it doesn't mean it's the right system to watch because it's not.\"",
      "Zirkzee marked his return to the starting line-up with a deflected effort to score his second goal of the season. However, Wolves got themselves level just before the break when Ladislav Krejc converted from a corner, leading to boos from the home fans at the break.",

However, the United boss refused to give anything away. \"No, we just play with 11 players, the formation is not the important thing,\" he said. \"The important thing is the spirit and our pace during the game and then the formation can change during the game or for the game.\"",
      "Despite the warm-up, United persisted with the back four. Dorgu moved over to the left wing with Joshua Zirkzee, replacing the injured Mason Mount, starting on the right. Shaw and Dalot retained their spot at full-back with Heaven and Martinez playing at centre-back.",
      "Amorim confirmed that Mount was forced to miss the game against Wolves due to a \"small\" injury. The former Chelsea man suffered the issue in the first half of their win over Newcastle.",
      "Interestingly, when United were out of possession and defending, Dorgu dropped deeper to play as a left wing-back to form a back five. Amorim's men nearly made the perfect start inside the first 15 minutes when Benjamin Sesko came so close to scoring just his third goal for the club.",

      "Manchester United have former academy star James Garner on their transfer shortlist as they look to strengthen Ruben Amorim's squad. A central midfielder is among the club's priorities moving forward having strengthened their forward line in the summer.",
      "Garner, 24, departed Old Trafford for Goodison Park in 2022 in a transfer worth up to £15million. The England under-21 season had spent the previous season on loan at Nottingham Forest and saw Casemiro and Christian Eriksen arrive before making his exit.",
      "After impressing in more than a century of games for Everton, United appear to be considering whether to tempt Garner back to his first club. Garner has just six months remaining on his contract, but Everton are said to have an option to extend his deal for a further year.",
      "Garner is one of eight names United are pondering, according to Mail Online. The club made approaches for Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher in the summer and retain interest in the Brighton and Atletico Madrid stars.",
      "Gallagher could be available in January if United are willing to stump up £35m. As they outlined in the summer, the La Liga side would insist on a sale rather than a loan deal.",
      "Crystal Palace ace Adam Wharton and Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams are also of interest to the Red Devils, as is Joao Gomes of Wolves. Ruben Neves is another player United are looking at as he nears the end of his contract with Saudi club Al-Hilal.",
      "Nottingham Forest and England star Elliot Anderson is reportedly top of the club's wishlist, however. The ex-Newcastle star is unlikely to be available in January and United could find themselves with stiff competition in the summer.",
      "Garner could prove to be a cost-effective option, with plans to spend more in the summer to prise Anderson from the City Ground.",
      "Everton boss David Moyes has suggested he has no plans to let Garner leave \"Look, I wouldn't be letting [Garner] go and I think the Club will do everything they can to make sure that he stays,\" he said earlier in December,",
      "\"It's probably a bit of a difference and shows signs [of progression] because I'm not sure many clubs have been after many Everton players in the past but now they're maybe starting to take a bit of interest, which is a good sign.",

      "Nicky Butt has claimed that Manchester United are “rotten from the bottom up” and that they won’t challenge for the Premier League title for at least eight years. The Red Devils have endured a rollercoaster decade since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag have all come and gone to various levels of success. Ruben Amorim was appointed as the latter’s replacement last season but the Portuguese has failed to inspire an upturn in fortunes.",
      "United endured their worst-ever Premier League season last term and had a similarly woeful start this time around. And while they have since recovered, Butt has suggested that their problems lie on the pitch - and not even the most talented managers would restore the club to its former glory.",
      "Speaking to FourFourTwo, the former United star said: “For me, it’s fundamentally that the club is rotten from the bottom up at the minute.",
      "“If you brought prime Sir Alex Ferguson back in, he wouldn’t be able to turn it around straight away, it would still take time. If you put Pep Guardiola in there, or Jurgen Klopp, it wouldn’t work either.",
      "“Ultimately, I think the players we’re buying and the players that we’re able to buy aren’t at the level we used to have, so it’s about accepting the fact that it’s going to take five to eight years in order to get the club back to anywhere near winning the Premier League.” He then added: “It’s been a s**tshow.\"",
      "Despite Butt’s claim that the Red Devils won’t be title contenders until at least 2033, United CEO Omar Berrada has claimed that it’s the club’s ambition to claim the Premier League crown by 2028.",
      "Speaking in the summer, he said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "He added: \"I firmly believe we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",

      "Napoli have already slotted a stunning release clause into Rasmus Hojlund's contract despite him still being on loan from Manchester United. The Danish striker joined the Italian giants on a temporary basis in the summer, albeit with an option to buy.",
      "That clause will become an obligation should Napoli seal a spot in next season’s Champions League and is worth €50m (£43.6m) to the Red Devils. As it stands, the reigning Serie A champions sit third in the standings and just two points behind current leaders Inter Milan.",
      "And it's clear Napoli think they are on the verge of sealing a bargain that could set them up for major profit down the line. As per Corriere dello Sport, an €85m (£74.2m) release clause will be written into his contract once his permanent move goes through and will activate in the summer of 2027.",
      "Hojlund, 22, has scored seven goals and notched three assists since signing for Napoli. And he dropped the clearest hint yet that he would not be returning to Old Trafford earlier this month as he said: “Next season, I’ll give my interviews in Italian.”",
      "Speaking about Hojlund’s recent form, Napoli boss Antonio Conte said: “Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund will be aiming to extend his promising run of form this weekend as Napoli travel to Rome for a clash with Lazio. His current form is a far cry from his United woes.",
      "Having been signed for big-money from Atalanta in 2023, he scored 16 goals across his debut season before following that up with a further ten in the following campaign, albeit just four of those came in the Premier League.",
      "United chose to bolster their attacking options in the summer with the signing of Benjamin Sesko from German side RB Leipzig, while Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brentford respectively.",

      "A victory for Ruben Amorim's team could propel them to fourth place, surpassing Liverpool. A single goal advantage over Wolves could secure this position before the Reds take on Leeds United on Thursday, January 1.",

      "Ruben Amorim's squad faced the rock-bottom Midlands outfit just a few weeks ago, at Molineux, where they emerged as comfortable 4-1 victors. During that game, Fernandes netted two goals, while Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount also scored for the Red Devils.",
      "United's captain and main playmaker has been out of action since before Christmas, having limped off at half-time in the narrow loss to Aston Villa. Consequently, he was absent from the Boxing Day victory over Newcastle United, and it seems the Wolves match has also come too soon for him.",
      "It will undoubtedly be a harsh blow for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers across the country, who would have hoped for his earlier return. Fernandes, valued at £9.2m, shares the highest points tally for a midfielder with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Regrettably not. Although the midfielder is striving for a quick comeback, it's anticipated he'll be out until early-January.",
      "Speaking during his pre-Wolves press conference, Amorim confirmed he doesn't expect to have his skipper available for selection. \"Bruno was already saying that he needs to train, but we don't know,\" the Portuguese manager said this week.",
      "\"No chance he's going to play against Wolves. No chance.\"",
      "Amorim was also keen to highlight Fernandes' leadership qualities and the significance of his presence in the changing room. His absence for the forthcoming matches represents a substantial setback as a consequence.",
      "\"He's the guy that is watching training even after treatment. He's going there,\" the United manager continued. \"I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader.",
      "\"He can't be that guy that when he's not playing, he's not talking and speaking. He's always speaking.",
      "\"That's why he's the captain. He has bad things sometimes, the way he moves his arms [gestures on-field], but he's got a lot of good things, too.",

      "The January transfer window is just around the corner and it could shape the Premier League title race and relegation battle. Whether strengthening the squad for the title run-in or panic-buying to try and avoid the drop, the mid-season window offers ample opportunities.",
      "This year, the January transfer window runs from January 1 until 7pm on February 2, allowing plenty of time to do business. Some deals have already been in the pipeline for some time, while others will emerge late on deadline day.",
      "There is precedent for big-spending after Premier League sides splashed a combined £370million in January 2025, with Manchester City accounting for over half of that by buying Omar Marmoush, Vitor Reis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Nico Gonzalez for £190m. That didn’t come close to January 2023, though, when a record £815m was spent.",
      "This one is pretty much nailed on. Bournemouth are ready to sell, with Semenyo’s £65m release clause now common knowledge, and the Ghana international has made it plain that he wants to join City following a run of strong form.",
      "Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea were all credited with interest in Semenyo, but have backed off after City made progress in talks. Those negotiations have gone well and the 25-year-old is expected to join the Premier League title-chasers in the early weeks of January after netting eight goals in 16 league games.",
      "This deal had appeared to be nailed on in the summer. Guehi underwent a medical to complete a £35m move from Crystal Palace to Liverpool before Palace chairman Steve Parish pulled the plug at the last minute. But the Palace captain is out of contract in June and the club have made peace with his impending departure.",
      "The only questions that remain are where and when. Arne Slot has previously stated that Liverpool wouldn’t return for Guehi in January, but an ACL injury to Giovanni Leoni, the shaky form of Ibrahima Konate – who is also approaching the end of his contract – and competition from Real Madrid and Bayern Munich could force their hand. The England defender is keen on moving to Merseyside, although Palace do want to keep him until the end of the season.",
      "Zirkzee has struggled since joining Manchester United from Bologna in the summer of 2024 for £36.5m and now he could be leaving. Roma sporting director Ricky Massara was in London for talks earlier in December and United are open to selling, but only under the right terms, given Ruben Amorim’s thread-bare squad.",
      "United will sell for a fee of around €35-40m (£30-35m), given the 24-year-old is under contract until June 2029. However, Roma want a loan deal worth an initial €5m-6m (£4.3-5.2m) with an obligation to buy if they qualify for the Champions League. One to keep an eye on.",
      "Johnson scored 18 goals in all competitions for Spurs last season, including the winner in the Europa League final, but has been scarcely used by Thomas Frank and a move is imminent. The Athletic says that a £35m deal has been agreed between the two parties and Palace now just need to sort out personal terms.",
      "Johnson joined Spurs from Nottingham Forest in September 2023 for £47.5m, but is now moving onto pastures new.",
      "Mohammed Kudus has basically taken Johnson’s place in the Spurs line-up, but the winger’s exit could mean an arrival in north London. Tottenham had a £60m bid rejected by Man City for Savinho in the summer, but they may be more keen to sell now Semenyo is arriving to further increase competition for places in Pep Guardiola ’s side.",
      "Savinho has been stuck on the bench at City this season and may jump at the chance of more regular game time. Equally, his record of five goals and 16 assists in 70 appearances could tempt City to sell.",
      "Mainoo has made his frustration plain this season, having been stuck on the bench under Amorim’s management. The injury to Bruno Fernandes then came just as Mainoo himself picked up a knock, adding to the frustration, and he wants out.",
      "Napoli have benefited massively from signing Scott McTominay from United and want a repeat with Mainoo. Amorim has maintained that Mainoo is not for sale and is a part of the club’s future, so it remains to be seen whether United would change that stance – especially given their injuries and AFCON absentees right now.",
      "Everton are not getting much out of Beto and Thierno Barry (a combined three goals in 40 appearances this season, to be precise), so are keen on a new striker. Ivan Toney is eager to seal a place in the England squad for the summer and could return from making a fortune in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Toney has 43 goals and 10 assists in 63 games for Al-Ahli and would undoubtedly be a good signing. The problem is that Al-Ahli don’t want to sell and that Toney would face a huge tax bill upon returning to the UK.",
      "The Hammers need reinforcements and fast as they sink towards the Championship. Nuno Espirito Santo will be backed in the transfer window and the ex- Wolves manager is turning to a familiar face. Traore is a favourite from their time together at Wolves and Fulham are happy to sell the beefy winger, who isn’t playing much under Marco Silva.",
      "Chelsea would like to find new homes for Disasi and Raheem Sterling, who were in the dreaded ‘bomb squad’ over the summer. Disasi has since been included in the first team by Enzo Maresca, but is still well down the pecking order.",
      "Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham all showed an interest in Disasi in the summer, but Palace seems more likely, given they need to plan for life without Guehi.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim said the decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half-time of Manchester United's draw with Wolves was because his side were struggling to gain control of the midfield. Zirkzee scored United's goal via a deflection but the visitors were the better side before the break, despite failing to win a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced at half-time by teenager Jack Fletcher. Amorim confirmed the decision was tactical and he felt it paid off, with his team better able to win possession back in the second half, although they continued to struggle for creativity.",
      "\"We need to do what the game was asking. They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" said Amorim. \"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Despite that, Amorim only turned to academy debutant Bendito Mantato and centre-back Leny Yoro after the break. He ignored the attacking options of Shea Lacey and Chido Obi on the bench despite United desperately needing a goal to earn the victory.",
      "The 40-year-old defended that decision and said the circumstances weren't right to throw too many youngsters on, with eight first-team players missing and his team struggling for fluidity. \"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\"",

United took the lead in the 27th minute through a heavily deflected Joshua Zirkzee effort, but Wolves drew level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a headed goal from defender Ladislav Krejci.",

      "Sarcastic cheers for Zirkzee",
      "There was a smattering of sarcastic cheers from the Stretford End when it was announced that Zirkzee had been replaced by Jack Fletcher for the second half of the game.",
      "Zirkzee was responsible for the opening goal of the match, but he also had a hand in the Wolves' equaliser, which is partly why some United fans were happy to see him brought off.",
      "Amorim hooked Zirkzee in favour of giving Fletcher his third senior appearance. Zirkzee is keen to leave in the January window for the sake of regular starts, and he may be granted his wish.",
      "It was time last year that Zirkzee was booed by his own fans after being hooked in the 33rd minute against Newcastle. The reaction against Wolves wasn't as bad, but the smattering of sarcastic cheers proves that he has failed to convince matchgoing fans since his arrival from Bologna.",
      "Where was the anger?",
      "The reaction - or lack of - from United's players to Krejci's equalising goal was fascinating, as they trudged back to the halfway line without saying a word to each other.",
      "Casemiro scooped the ball out of the net and kicked it away in frustration, but there was no inquest amongst the red shirts to determine how the Premier League's worst side had scored.",
      "The lack of a response was the kind of thing that Roy Keane would slam if he were on punditry duty. Where was the leadership among a group of senior players?",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost certainly would have led an inquest if he had been on the pitch.",
      "The sluggish start",
      "Amorim has regularly spoken about the importance of starting well at Old Trafford because coming out of the traps quickly whips up the crowd and helps to create an intimidating atmosphere.",
      "United's players looked like they had eaten too much turkey and Christmas pudding in the opening exchanges against Wolves, though. Amorim was not happy with the sluggish start and became increasingly frustrated on the touchline, waving his arms in an attempt to encourage quicker play from the back.",
      "The crowd went flat due to the pedestrian pace. \"Is this the Etihad?\" the Wolves fans taunted, which was followed by a rendition of \"You're just a ground full of tourists.\"",
      "It was understandable that Old Trafford was not at its loudest. Wolves rocked up in Manchester with two points, but they looked like the better side, running harder and winning second balls.",
      "The arm around Sesko",
      "Sesko created an opportunity for himself in the first half thanks to some brilliant centre-forward play, shrugging off his marker before fashioning a yard in space in the box and pulling the trigger. The shot was fired inches wide of the post, and Sesko hit the woodwork shortly after that.",
      "The Slovenia international rose highest from a corner, but his header smacked against the post. He looked to the ground, wondering what more he had to do, and Diogo Dalot put his arm around him.",
      "Dalot looked to be telling his teammate to keep going. Sesko heeded that advice and continued to get himself in dangerous areas, but his inexperience was evident again when he sent a simple header wide following a clever lofted ball over the top from Casemiro.",
      "It would be more concerning if Sesko wasn't getting into promising positions to score. Nonetheless, his finishing must sharpen to fire United into the Champions League places this season.",
      "Happy with Heaven",
      "United simply could not get going in the opening 20 minutes against Wolves, so it was not a surprise to see fans celebrate a moment of aggression from Ayden Heaven as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Heaven made an outstanding tackle to dispossess Hwang Hee-chan and pockets of fans around the press box rose to their feet to applaud. And they were standing again just 10 seconds later.",
      "Heaven drove with the ball and found Zirkzee around the box. The Dutchman found the back of the net thanks to a heavy deflection, but it was Heaven that deserved all the credit for the goal.",
      "The crowd's reaction to Heaven's tackle was telling. It was the first time in the game that a United player had shown some fight, and it proved to be a catalyst to break the deadlock.",

      "Manchester United ended 2025 with a whimper as they failed to beat a Wolves side who have now failed to win any of their first 19 Premier League games of the season. United started the game poorly but took the lead with a scrappy goal. Ayden Heaven won possession to start the move but the ball fell kindly for Joshua Zirkzee, whose effort was deflected in off Ladislav Krejci.",

      "Senne Lammens: Couple of excellent saves in either half, the second of which from Krejci was a strong hand and he reacted well to claw the ball from danger. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing radar not as good as it usually is and didn't carry the same authority as he did on Boxing Day. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: His challenge on Hwang Hee-chan led to the first goal and he was solid in the middle of the defence. Boos when replaced by Yoro showed fans are falling for him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Lots of ground to cover in the second half and tested at times, but showed his fitness is improving. Combination with Patrick Dorgu seems to be lacking something. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Didn't contribute much in an attacking sense and Wolves found joy down his wing. One good block late on. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Playing because there's nobody else. Solid enough defensively but a weak point in possession and targeted when he gets on the ball. 5",
      "Casemiro: Not at his best and partnership with Ugarte is lacking the ability to control games. Needs to be reunited with a Kobbie Mainoo or Bruno Fernandes as soon as possible. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Would have been mystified at being moved back to the left. Pushed higher in the second half but struggled to match his Boxing Day heroics. Scored late on but ruled out. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Goal owed a lot to good fortune. It came after more fancy flicks and there were plenty of those, but not enough of the dirty work that Amorim had demanded. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: Failed to match the impact he has had in recent games on a night when so much should have been going through him. 5",

      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim. Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "It's only a couple of weeks since Paul Scholes said Amorim didn't get Manchester United. This is the kind of night that makes you think he might just be on to something. They have improved this season, but the football can be slow and uninspiring. Amorim will point to the injuries. His critics will point to the level of opposition.",
      "Even the goal they got owed plenty to a big slice of fortune. It was a year to the day since Joshua Zirkzee was replaced after just 33 minutes of an Old Trafford defeat to Newcastle, with the ironic cheers that greeted his number going up the kind of moment that can kill a player's confidence. The Dutchman has shown character in recovering from that, but not the quality that suggests his stay at this club will last much longer.",
      "This time, he lasted 45 minutes and even managed a goal, but it was the kind of night that showed why Amorim is running out of patience with him. His goal was a scuffed shot that deflected in off Ladislav Krejci, but beyond that it was another casual performance that suggested he is a fish out of water in a team that wants to play with any kind of physicality and tempo.",
      "Amorim was on his case from the start. He had called for an improvement in Zirkzee's approach to duels before kick-off, but none was forthcoming. The 24-year-old used the outside of his foot more than the inside, offering fancy flicks around the corner to try and link with Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, but when it came to getting his hands dirty, he didn't want to know.",
      "The goal actually owed more to a tone-setting challenge from Ayden Heaven, who stole the ball from Hwang Hee-chan and drove forward towards the edge of the box. It was one of the few positive pieces of play United produced in a dire first half.",
      "Sesko fashioned a chance for himself out of nothing and then hit the post with a header from a corner, but Wolves were the better team. Senne Lammens was alert to save from Hugo Bueno, but then saw Krejci's header from a corner inadvertently flicked on by Zirkzee arrow past him.",
      "It was following a similar pattern to the game at Molineux three weeks ago, when Wolves also equalised just before half-time. That came out of nothing, whereas at Old Trafford it was the least they deserved. It also lacked the second-half onslaught United delivered in the Midlands.",
      "If you were being charitable, you could say Wolves had improved since that defeat, but they had still lost every game. They almost dished out some charity of their own when Yerson Mosquera headed past his own goalkeeper, only for Jose Sa to claw the ball on the line.",
      "United needed their own goalkeeper to come to the rescue soon after, Lammens brilliantly saving from Krejci and then getting up to claw the ball away from danger. Diogo Dalot chucked himself in front of a shot from Jhon Arias to deflect it behind for a corner.",
      "For all the huffing and puffing, United's own attacks lacked quality. Too often, they don't get enough men forward. They briefly thought they had won it when Patrick Dorgu slammed in after Sa saved Sesko's shot, but he was marginally offside. It summed up a night of frustration.",
      "The final whistle was greeted by jeers and dropped points against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves in four of their last five games at Old Trafford are going to prove costly. The away end celebrated with chants of \"we've got a point\", and that might be the ultimate humiliation for United.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",
      "It didn't work and although United were missing key players in Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim refused to use those absences as an excuse, but admitted he knew why his side had struggled.",
      "\"That is normal but we didn't use that excuse against Newcastle, we are not going to use it today,\" he said. \"But of course if you see the game I understand why we play the way we play today.",
      "\"The lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle because in Newcastle we have more space to play. We didn't have to work the plays so much and today we have.\"",

Joshua Zirkzee scored thanks to a heavily deflected strike in the 27th minute, however, Wolves drew level on the stroke of half-time following a headed goal from defender Ladislav Krejci.",
      "\"Really disappointed,\" said Martinez. \"We can't come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it's our responsibility.",
      "\"We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn't press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving around and creating spaces.\"",
      "The defender added that he believes Wolves should not be bottom of the league. \"Wolves don't deserve the place they are, it's a strong team. We respect them,\" he said. \"We have to take more risks. The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and go for the next one.\"",

The kind of play we didn’t see from Hojlund last year, creating a chance out of nothing. Maybe that will get United going, because it’s been really flat so far.

      "The back four has been and gone. The shiny new toy on Boxing Day but forgotten about before New Year’s Eve. Something of a surprise to see Amorim switch back to this system at home to Wolves, but the proof will be in the pudding. Dorgu excellent on the right wing and one of the benefits of that system was the number of players in support of the attackers. Not always had that in a back three. United should be dominating this game in terms of territory so chances to get players forward."

      "Sir Alex Ferguson always believed Marcus Rashford would succeed at Manchester United despite the forward's public struggles with Ruben Amorim. Rashford certainly doesn't need to prove himself to the legendary Fergie, though, who has long been a fan of the forward.",
      "The Scot celebrates his 84th birthday on Wednesday and has made plenty of positive comments on the 28-year-old in the past. Rashford has been plying his trade at LaLiga side Barcelona this season following a very tense fallout with current United boss Amorim.",
      "The forward was exiled to Aston Villa on loan for the second half of last season, before he headed to Spain with the chance to reignite his form. He has done just that, scoring seven goals and assisting 11 times for Hansi Flick's side.",
      "However, it appears the England international's longer-term future with Barcelona is still up in the air due to salary issues. Spanish outlet El Nacional previously reported Rashford isn't willing to accept a pay cut if he signs for the LaLiga giants on a permanent basis.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The forward agreed to a 25% drop in salary to join Barca in the summer, which reportedly earns him a £12.1million annual paycheque. Now, however, fellow Spanish outlet Sport claims there has been a breakthrough, and 28-year-old is open to discussing a wage drop in order to stay within the club's salary cap.",
      "The U-turn may well upset Ferguson, as he always believed the forward was destined for great things in Manchester. According to The Telegraph, the Scot told his inner circle that he has dreamed of managing the England international at United and emphasised the need to use Rashford's skills for the benefit of the entire team.",
      "The iconic manager also believed he could harness Rashford's best position if he was working with him, admitting many people opt to play the star in the wrong position. Speaking after United's 2023 Carabao Cup win, Ferguson was adamant the forward is the most effective playing off the left and not through the middle as a striker.",
      "He said: \"Well I don’t think he’s a striker. He operates from the left hand side which is fantastic. His finishing is always good, keeps his shots down which is really important.",
      "\"He’s in a great vein of form and unfortunately for us he’s the main source of goals, we could do with an extra one. But he’s doing it.\"",
      "Fergie has also praised Rashford's off-field work after the star received the Football Writers' Association Tribute award for his work to fight child food poverty. The former United boss was full of praise for Rashford's work, even going as far as to donate up to £2million to match donations for the FareShare charity.",
      "Congratulating Marcus at the awards in 2021, Ferguson said: \"I would like to congratulate Marcus on his achievement and presentation (of the FWA Tribute Award) tonight. I have known him since being a kid of seven years of age, and seen him develop through the ranks of Manchester United into a truly wonderful person.",
      "\"Apart from his football life, what he has achieved in the last few months is quite astonishing, how he has helped the people in need is a truly amazing achievement. I would like to congratulate him on that. He has shown to young people in particular there is a different way of dealing with life.",
      "\"He has shown great humility, he has shown courage to do what he did, so this achievement is well deserved and should be recognised with what he has done. So Marcus, well done on a fantastic achievement.\"",
      "\"I wasn't nervous, I was just excited. That is the feeling that we got anyway being in and around the first-team, maybe passing them in the corridors, just small stuff like that, it builds your excitement and your hunger really.",
      "\"It's like a reminder that is where you want to get to and that's why a lot of players have come through during his [Ferguson] reign as manager and even now.\"",
      "Rashford shares the sentiment that he would've loved to have been coached by Fergie, admitting it's his one dream in football. Discussing his admiration for the manager in 2021, he added: \"For me it was an unbelievable experience and I think for me that is probably the only regret I have ever had in my career, never having the chance to play under Sir Alex.",
      "\"It is something which will probably never going to happen now, but to be on the phone to him and just have 10 or 15 minutes conversation with him was amazing and I am pleased he was aware of the situation and he wanted to help as well, so it was brilliant.\"",
      "With both United heroes sharing the same sentiments for one another, there is no question that Ferguson could likely get the best out of Rashford if he was the current United boss. But that responsibility lies with Amorim, who has to decide whether to stick or twist with the former United academy star should he return to Manchester.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson was lauded for many of his signings at Manchester United but even he made mistakes in the transfer window. The legendary manager, who celebrates his 84th birthday on Wednesday, once described midfielder Owen Hargreaves’ time at Old Trafford as “a disaster”.",
      "The England international arrived at United from Bayern Munich with a tremendous pedigree in 2007. The new £17million man had won four Bundesliga titles and clinched the Champions League during his time at the German club, with Hargreaves also earning acclaim on the international stage for his star performances during the 2006 World Cup.",
      "A defensive midfielder, he was viewed as a possible successor to Roy Keane and initially enjoyed success. Hargreaves made 34 appearances in his debut season as Ferguson’s side secured a memorable Premier League and Champions League double, including scoring in the fateful penalty shootout against Chelsea.",
      "However, his fortunes quickly soured the following year, with a recurring patellar tendinitis problem keeping him sidelined and virtually ending his career. Hargreaves would make just five further appearances over the next three seasons, leading Ferguson to label him one of his most underwhelming signings.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt.",
      "\"I didn’t feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern. I met Owen’s agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United.",
      "\"It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever. He didn’t show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking.",
      "\"I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "\"I rang him, when I heard,\" Hargreaves said in 2021. \"I was surprised myself. My family were really surprised.",
      "\"I think anyone who's been around me knows that I left home at 15 alone, to go to a country where I couldn't speak the language to play football. I left the comfort of Bayern to play for Man United, because I wanted to represent Man United, to play for Sir Alex and be part of that great team.",
      "\"I never took the easy step. I played for a country I wasn't even born in because I wanted to be the best. I probably never should have been a professional football player, based on my start! But I worked my way and, obviously, didn't finish the way I wanted. A lot of things went into that.”",
      "He added: \"As much as it was disappointing for him not having me play - because when I was fit, he played me all the time. I told him on the phone, I promised him, it broke me more than it did him. Because that was my career.",
      "\"To this day, I haven't done a day of sport since. I can't because of my knee. If you just forget the football side, my career changed from one day to the next and for a young man chasing a ball around all of his life, it was a pretty significant day. I haven't been able to play sport like that since. To say it went the way I envisioned would be a lie.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United have been \"dominant\" at Old Trafford this season, despite his side winning only half of their 10 home matches in the Premier League. Their form in front of their own fans has also taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks. Their only victory in the last five was a Boxing Day backs-to-the-wall effort against Newcastle United.",
      "Their latest home setback was a 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night, as the Premier League's basement boys picked up only their third point of a winless season to date. United lost to 10-man Everton at the end of November and have had December draws with West Ham and Bournemouth.",
      "Those results look even worse in the context of the opposition's form. West Ham haven't won in eight Premier League but drew at Old Trafford in that run. Bournemouth are winless in 10 but managed a point in a 4-4 draw against United and Wolves have won none of their last 15 in all competitions, but still claimed a share of the honours on Tuesday.",
      "Despite those dubious form lines, Amorim is confident United are on the right track at Old Trafford, although jeers at the end of their latest disappointing result suggested not everyone will agree with him.",
      "\"I think against Everton we clearly underperformed,\" said Amorim. \"West Ham, we had some lack of creation but we have our chances. Bournemouth, we had the advantage three times, so it's the details, it was not offensively, was not the creation of chances. We had the game, we had full control of the game. Today was completely different.",
      "\"Newcastle, we struggled but we managed to win at home. I think this year I don't feel that, I feel the support of the fans when we are here, I feel that they want to play at home, I feel that we are dominant at home.",
      "\"We won one that they were a little bit more dominant, was the last one. Today we had lack of quality, fluidity in the game today and that was the reason of our game today.\"",
      "Amorim is also convinced United are on the right track and when the eight players missing through injury or international duty are back, the fortunes will turn once again.",
      "\"I'm really confident. We just need to recover all the players and I'm really confident,\" he said. \"I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the season.",
      "\"Then we will make the resume of the season, but I'm really confident when we recover all the players that we are going to be a strong team. There is no doubt in my mind.\"",

      "The United boss has persisted with a 3-4-3 formation since arriving in November 2024. However, Amorim switched to a 4-2-3-1 system in the win against Newcastle. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad away at AFCON and Bruno Fernandes sidelined due to injury, the United boss made an unexpected adjustment to his squad.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was moved to the right wing, where he scored the decisive goal, while Luke Shaw returned to his usual left-back position after regularly playing as a left centre-back. However, for the Wolves match, Amorim was compelled to alter his starting line-up due to Mason Mount's injury, with Joshua Zirkzee stepping in.",
      "\"This isn't right again,\" he commented. \"So I think I've watched enough United over this last five or six weeks. I've watched six out of their last seven games to know what looks right and what isn't right and I'm really surprised.",
      "\"Zirkzee on this right side having to chase back to right back almost, Dalot right wing back, Ayden Heaven right centre back, Dorgu over on the left back where he's not been playing well.",
      "\"All of it just isn't as good as it was in the last couple of games where they've played in different positions and we should be OK to say that. I think that's what the fans are thinking inside this stadium. They're in exactly the same place as we are.",
      "\"The performances have been so much better in these last two or three games through the tweaks that have been made but he's gone back tonight to his 3-4-3 but the problem is he has got players in the system.",
      "\"Zirkzee on this right channel, obviously he's going central now. Dalot over here, having to come back all the time, it's not right. They're playing against a team tonight that are struggling so could win and get away with it but it doesn't mean it's the right system to watch because it's not.\"",
      "Zirkzee celebrated his return to the starting eleven with a deflected strike to net his second goal of the campaign, but had to come off at half-time due to a suspected injury.",
      "Wolves went into the break level, after grabbing the equaliser moments before half-time when Ladislav Krejc found the target from a corner, prompting jeers from the home supporters at the interval.",
      "Despite dominating the ball in the second half, United were held to another disappointing home result to miss the chance to move into the top four places.",

      "England legend Gary Lineker has revealed he shares the same agent as Manchester United defender Ayden Heaven, and that the 19-year-old is in good hands.",
      "The teenager has risen to prominence at United since his move from Premier League rivals Arsenal earlier this year. After making a handful of appearances under Ruben Amorim last term, he has been more heavily involved this season, particularly with mounting injuries in defensive areas.",
      "Heaven has made several appearances across all competitions this term and has featured in the last five league matches. That run includes a standout performance in their recent narrow win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Lineker, an England legend who represented the likes of Leicester City, Barcelona and Everton during his playing days, has offered some insight into the team supporting Heaven’s development at Old Trafford. Lineker is represented by long-standing agent Jon Holmes, who works alongside one of Heaven’s representatives, Andy May.",
      "\"We have the same agent,\" Lineker revealed on this week's The Rest is Football podcast. \"Andy [May] looks after him.",
      "\"He's in good hands. He came to Ballers League with me last season. He's a nice lad.\"",
      "Alongside May, Heaven is also represented by his mother, Lisa, and both played a significant role in securing his move from Arsenal to United earlier this year. \"Delighted to have assisted Ayden Heaven with his transfer from Arsenal to Manchester United, alongside Karim Bouzidi and Lisa Heaven,\" May shared in a social media post back in February.",
      "\"It has been a pleasure during the past couple of years to witness Ayden’s development as a footballer and person. This significant move, and the confidence shown in him by his new club, is a testament to his talent, dedication, and ambition.\"",
      "Heaven's recent performance against Newcastle was the latest example of his continued development and impressed the pundits watching on. Former Manchester City star Micah Richards, in particular, feels the youngster has all the tools to become a top defender.",
      "\"He reads the game really well for a young player,\" he chimed in, also speaking on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Physically, he can deal with it and he's strong enough.",
      "\"He's quick enough. But he reads the game well, and for a young player to read the game like that [is fantastic]. I thought it was a really good performance from him, and they needed him because of [the injuries].\"",
      "Heaven will hope to have another opportunity to prove himself when United host Wolves at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. With Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt still recovering from injury, Ruben Amorim could turn to the youngster once again.",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "Manchester United teenage defender Ayden Heaven will not be switching international allegiances from England to Ghana, according to reports this week.",
      "The 19-year-old, formerly of Arsenal, signed for the Red Devils for a nominal fee at the start of the year and made a handful of senior appearances towards the tail end of last season. He made his first-team debut in March in a Europa League clash against Real Sociedad.",
      "This term, Heaven has made several Premier League appearances, five of which have been starts. He recently played the full 90 minutes in a narrow defeat against Aston Villa, and featured against Newcastle on Boxing Day, where he was named the Premier League Player of the Match as Amorim's side kept a rare clean sheet.",
      "So far, the teenager has represented England at various youth levels and earned his first call-up to the Under-20s side in the autumn. He was not selected for the November international break due to injury, but is likely to be included in one of the squads when international football resumes in the spring.",
      "Despite being born in London, Heaven also qualifies to represent Ghana through a grandparent, and his development has understandably been monitored. Under current FIFA rules, players can switch national teams provided they have played no more than three competitive senior games before the age of 21, have not featured in the latter stages of an international tournament and as long as three years have passed since their last senior appearance.",
      "According to the BBC, Heaven will not be switching allegiances to represent Ghana, with the World Cup fast approaching. Although Ghana did not qualify for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, they did book their place at next summer's tournament in the United States and have been drawn in a group with England, Croatia and Panama.",
      "The article notes that Heaven wants to represent England at senior level and force his way into the first-team squad, a feat he will surely achieve so long as he continues on an upward trajectory at United.",
      "Heaven has earned the praise of manager Ruben Amorim this season, with the Portuguese coach highlighting the youngster's attitude and application in training. \"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" he told the media recently.",
      "\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game.",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has made a strong impression during his loan spell at Barcelona, with the majority of the Catalan club's supporters keen for him to be signed on a permanent basis next summer, according to a poll conducted by a Spanish media outlet.",
      "Rashford moved to the La Liga heavyweights in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing on a deal that includes an option for the Spanish club to make the move permanent at the end of the season. To retain Rashford beyond May 2026, Barca would need to fork out approximately £26 million.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under manager Hansi Flick. His impressive form has put him in the running for an England call-up for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Reports from Spain suggest that Flick is eager to keep Rashford at the club and efforts are underway to secure a deal.",
      "A poll conducted by Mundo Deportivo revealed that 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would support the club in exercising the purchase option in Rashford's loan deal. A small fraction, 6.3 per cent, believe that sporting director Deco should wait until the end of the season before making a decision.",
      "This leaves nearly 40 per cent of fans opposed to the idea of signing Rashford on a permanent basis.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Rashford himself seems to be enjoying life at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy graduate has spoken about his future aspirations with the club.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has hit out at the Red Devils for the “baddest of the bad” display against Wolves as he criticised Ruben Amorim’s substitutions.",
      "The Red Devils put in a woeful display to give bottom side Wolves only their third point of the season in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.",
      "Wolves, who have only scored 11 goals all season, had higher expected goals than Man Utd with the Red Devils continuing to show inconsistent form in the Premier League.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee’s deflected shot put Man Utd ahead on 27 minutes but Wolves found an equaliser through Ladislav Krejci on the stroke of half-time.",
      "Krejci and Jhon Arias both came close to winning it for Wolves in the second half, while Man Utd wing-back Patrick Dorgu was denied a late winner by VAR.",
      "READ: Transfer dominoes: Five moves set in motion by Man City signing Semenyo",
      "“Sometimes I think when you get a boo at the end of the game, it’s the majority that boo and then the ones that stay will usually signal the fact that they’re appreciative of the fact that they’re walking around.",
      "“But that wasn’t it. They were staying to boo them.”",
      "Neville thought their display “was the baddest of the bad” against Wolves and the Man Utd legend was frustrated by Amorim’s choice of team against the Premier League’s bottom side.",
      "Former Man Utd right-back Neville added: “I’m not going to get emotional because I don’t think it’s something that is helpful for anybody but that was the baddest of the bad, that.",
      "“We saw them warming up before the game and they were warming up in the system of three at the back with [Ayden] Heaven to the right, [Lisandro] Martinez and [Luke] Shaw.",
      "“Then, up front they had [Diogo] Dalot at right wing-back, Dorgu at left wing-back and then they had Zirkzee in the right channel, [Matheus] Cunha in the left channel and [Benjamin] Sesko.",
      "“I said at the time that they were warming up in wrong shape before Newcastle to fool everybody the other night and then they ended up playing a back-four, so I said to ignore that.",
      "“As soon as I saw that shape was going to be played… I’ve seen Zirkzee playing in that right channel before and it just doesn’t work.",
      "“We know that Dorgu is a left wing-back and we’ve seen him play there a number of times now and he does okay there, he’s willing, and so does Dalot at right wing-back. I think they’re both willing. I’ve played that position and I think I was a pretty decent right-back… it’s a bloody tough position to play right wing-back or left wing-back, it just is.",
      "“I thought Dorgu was so good on the right wing against Newcastle, I just thought he looked free. He could come in on his left foot, he looked more inventive, he looked more like a wide player.",
      "“So I was struggling with it from 30 seconds but what I didn’t want to do was start the negativity after 30 seconds because the reality of it is that you’ve got to let them settle in and if they go and score two then you look a little bit stupid as well.”",
      "READ: Amorim asking for trouble as latest Man Utd disaster exposes false PL position, baffling transfer claim",
      "Neville continued: “Let’s be really clear: after five minutes I thought, ‘That’s not going to work all night, that’s going to be a bad performance and he’s going to have to change that after 15 minutes’… after 15 minutes he didn’t change it and after 20 minutes I said, ‘This is it’.",
      "“I think my words were, ‘They might score two in the next 20 minutes but this is not right’, and I’ve been very complimentary of the last two or three performances: Bournemouth, Villa and Newcastle.",
      "“There were things in those three performances that I’ve liked and I genuinely believed that entertainment and performance matters. I matters for two reasons at his club: these fans come here to be entertained, like every other football fan in the country, but you’ve got to entertain here… there’s 75,000 of them and they want entertaining.",
      "“Secondly, I genuinely believe that performance leads to results. I know some people say that results aren’t everything, but it’s very difficult to win a lot of football matches if you’re not performing well.”",
      "Man Utd had some excuses for their poor display with Bruno Fernandes out injured and Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui all at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Neville said: “It was really simple tonight. The AFCON players aren’t here, we know the injured players aren’t there and it’s actually made his job more simple. There’s more sympathy for him.",
      "“Sesko plays up top, Cunha plays to the left, Dorgu plays to the right, Zirkzee plays in that little hold off Sesko. You’ve got [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro in midfield, you’ve got Luke Shaw at left-back, Ayden Heaven and Martinez at centre-back and you’ve got Dalot at right-back. It’s not not an amazing team but it’s really obvious that that’s the team that should be picked, in the system that we should be playing.",
      "“It should have been picked and it was so obvious. It’s Zirzkee’s best position, dropping in, Sesko’s got someone close to him which means he’s not playing up front on his own, Cunha’s on the left and can drift in and that’s fine, you’ve got Shaw who can go round him and he’s really good to play with on that side.",
      "“You’ve then got Dalot coming from behind on the other side but you’ve got Dorgu that can cut in which means Dalot go round.",
      "“The big question marks you would have in that system would be Casemiro and Ugarte, and Heaven and Martinez. However, I thought Ugarte and Casemiro did really well against Newcastle, I thought Ugarte and had his best game for the club, and I thought Heaven and Martinez did brilliantly against Newcastle.",
      "“So I thought those four would just be certain to start there. I always want to say that it’s not just the manager, not just the players as there’s a culmination of everything when you get a bad performance.",
      "“But I do think tonight that the manager has to look at that and think, “I got that wrong and I complicated it”, because they just needed simplicity.”",
      "Amorim could not avoid more criticism with Neville calling all of his substitutions “bizarre”, he went on: “The substitutions made us worse, they made Manchester United worse. Every single substitution was bizarre.",
      "“I don’t know what’s happened with Zirkzee at half-time. If he was injured then fair enough, get him off the pitch.",
      "“If Zirkzee wasn’t injured and that was a tactical substitution then it was a really poor one. And I’m not saying Zirkzee is Eric Cantona… he’s not, let’s by clear, not by any stretch of the imagination.",
      "“But I have to say, he needed to be out there for physicality, for presence, for experience and he’d scored.",
      "“You couldn’t take him off so I’m hoping he’s injured. I don’t mean that in a bad way! I’m hoping he’s injured for Ruben Amorim.”",
      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night…",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United could make two signings in January as they would “only” let Joshua Zirkzee leave on one condition.",
      "Ruben Amorim has ruled one key Manchester United player out of contention for Tuesday night’s Premier League match against Wolves.",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed why it’s now the time to change formation at Manchester United, as buckling to media pressure previously would have been “the end” for him.",
      "It’s starting to look more when than if for Thomas Frank as Spurs head for serious relegation trouble after his moribund leadership.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",

      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "City are said to be closing in on the signing of Semenyo having shown the most determination to trigger the winger’s release clause in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "As ever, one transfer leads to another. And a few more besides.",
      "Here we assess how Semenyo joining City could prompt major moves for five other players. Starting with the first trigger…",
      "Semenyo will be the first domino to fall in January, with Manchester City seemingly far down a road they rarely, if ever, lose their way.",
      "City want Semenyo signed sharpish, not just because the terms of the winger’s buy-out clause in his Bournemouth contract dictate so, but also to keep the other vultures at bay.",
      "Until Semenyo has a blue scarf above his head while revealing a soft spot for Oasis, Curly Watts and very tall floodlights, there remains the feeling Liverpool might attempt to throw an expensive spanner in the works.",
      "But we just don’t see City losing out here. And not only because it would screw the whole premise on which this feature is built.",
      "",
      "City already have a surplus of players, with Savinho and/or Oscar Bobb set to be the big losers if they snare Semenyo.",
      "Weirdly, the Brazilian has had the same number of Premier League minutes (467) as Bobb but neither winger is really doing the business in Pep’s mind. Savinho has two league assists to Bobb’s one. Neither has scored a Premier League goal to take any burden off Erling Haaland’s shoulders. Good job, then, that he’s just a ridiculous goalscorer.",
      "Still, with domestic and European competition fierce in what could be the manager’s final half-season at City, Guardiola is clearly keen to upgrade on the right flank, with Savinho the most sellable asset. Especially while Tottenham retain a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "Spurs, apparently, are keen to gauge Savinho’s level of interest before they proceed any further only to be covered in custard again. The winger will be feeling the chill at City and Spurs could offer a more defined role than the cameos on either flank he has been restricted to by Guardiola.",
      "MORE: Man City signing Semenyo will give Guardiola a quarter of the 20 biggest January signings ever",
      "",
      "Even before they have signed Savinho, Spurs already seem to be making room by off-loading their Europa League final goalscorer.",
      "Johnson is being fought over by Palace and Bournemouth, with other clubs also said to be keen on the Wales attacker.",
      "Bournemouth seemed to be in a strong position given their obvious need for a Semenyo replacement and the £65million they will have burning a hole in their pocket. Johnson would cost around half that amount, but Palace have reportedly nipped in ahead of the Cherries.",
      "Ornstein says the Eagles have agreed a deal with Spurs worth in the region of £35million, but Johnson is still mulling over his options. So Bournemouth retain hope of landing the 24-year-old, even if Palace are the frontrunners.",
      "",
      "Be it Johnson or anyone else, someone has to replace Semenyo at Bournemouth.",
      "The Cherries’ have slid at breakneck speed into a relegation battle few foresaw just a few weeks ago when Semenyo was on fire while Andoni Iraola’s lurked in the European spots.",
      "But seven games without a goal or assist from Semenyo saw Bournemouth take just five points from 21, highlighting the importance of finding a ready-made replacement for the Ghanaian, especially if they are to spend the second half of the season looking over their shoulder.",
      "The thing is, Bournemouth don’t buy oven-ready. That’s not their model. Almost certainly, they will cast their net into Europe or, as reports suggest is more likely, dip their toe back into the Championship talent pool.",
      "There, where they discovered Semenyo, they will find Fatawu, who has been catching eyes at Leicester from other Premier League clubs beyond the south coast. Sunderland and Everton have both been credited with an interest in the 21-year-old but Bournemouth’s means and haste makes them heavy favourites for Semenyo’s compatriot.",
      "",
      "Semenyo’s switch to City will leave almost the rest of the Big Six disappointed. For some, sure, it was a good opportunity to sign a top-class player for a relatively good price. But missing out allows them to concentrate on the priorities they should be focused on in January. We’re looking at you, Manchester United, and that gaping hole in your midfield.",
      "For Liverpool, though, there remains room in their squad for a Semenyo-like signing. Mo Salah is away at AFCON and Alexander Isak is out until perhaps the spring.",
      "Neither of those circumstances should prompt the Reds to splurge on another forward to fill a short-term void. But Salah’s absence is likely to be a more permanent arrangement, if not from this window, then most likely the summer.",
      "Other issues in Arne Slot’s squad mean it would not be a bad idea to get a jump on sourcing Salah’s replacement. Perhaps Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig? Liverpool certainly have an in with the teenager’s club, and a half-season head-start on the settling process could be useful.",
      "Diomande, though, remains raw and perhaps more expensive than Rodrygo, a player Liverpool have long admired, along with Manchester City. You would think, however, that Semenyo’s signing ends City’s interest in the Brazilian.",
      "Rodrygo joining Liverpool is undoubtedly the trickiest link in this particular domino chain. The Reds will have you believe they are not planning anything quite so grand in January, and the centre of their defence remains a bigger issue than uncertainty in their attack. This one remains speculative but Liverpool are full of surprises.",
      "",
      "Semenyo is certainly a boon for City midway through a title fight which is looking likely to be a humdinger. Will Arsenal respond?",
      "We think so. And, more to the point, Mikel Arteta seems to think so too: “We’re Arsenal and we have to be looking at it… we have to be actively looking.”",
      "Arsenal are entering January in a position of authority because they bought big in the summer. Liverpool spent more but the Gunners’ net spend was greater than anyone.",
      "Having built the strongest squad in the Premier League, it relieves the pressure around the January window somewhat. But despite their depth, Arteta’s resources are still being stretched. Without some swift and considerable relief on the fitness front, Arsenal will go back into the market.",
      "To sign whom? Honestly, we don’t know. We doubt Arsenal know at this point. Quite likely, they will react to the circumstances they encounter around the middle of the month. Which, in their position, is a sound approach.",
      "And the identity almost doesn’t matter in regards to countering City’s swoop for Semenyo. Arteta and Andrea Berta will be desperate to avoid a scenario in the summer where they have fallen short in a title race once more having sat on their hands when they had the opportunity to bolster their ranks and morale mid-season.",
      "Leandro Trossard has one Liverpool fan thinking wistfully of Diogo Jota, while there is plenty of chatter about the latest episode of Emiliano Martinez.",
      "There’s only one winner in the Premier League managers of 2025 battle, and it’s not the winner of the actual or the calendar year title.",
      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night…",
      "This was meant to be a worried, anxious, inhibited Arsenal. Perhaps they were for 20 minutes or so but Aston Villa soon caved like most others do and will.",
      "Man City are ‘closing in on a full agreement’ for Antoine Semenyo with Liverpool not expected to make a late move for the Bournemouth forward.",
      "We bring you the early Ballon d’Or odds, with 2025 runner-up Kylian Mbappe the early favourite for the gong in 2026."

      "Yes, there have also been reasons for optimism with Man Utd‘s transfer business, as it’s difficult to deem their most recent window anything other than an overwhelming success regarding how they dealt with incomings and outgoings.",
      "This, plus head coach Ruben Amorim finally leaving his ego at the door to show a willingness to adapt (for a little bit), has contributed to Man Utd’s growth this season as they have become a more effective unit.",
      "Still, the Red Devils remain miles from their end goal of being a squad capable of consistently challenging for major trophies, as evidenced by most of their performances this term.",
      "The changes in personnel and tactics have led to more points, but these factors have papered over the cracks as performances have been poor more often than good.",
      "This month alone, Man Utd have won two of their six Premier League games. Of these victories, one came via too many nervy moments with a pretty full-strength XI against Wolves, while the other was a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory against Newcastle United.",
      "So, despite United starting Tuesday night on the brink of the Champions League places, there has been enough evidence to suggest that they are in a false league position, and this was laid bare in the second of this month’s meetings against Wolves.",
      "Man Utd are impacted more than most by AFCON absences, while injuries have also taken their toll, but they still had more than enough talent in their squad to beat a side that headed into Tuesday’s match with only two points from their opening 18 Premier League games.",
      "Therefore, the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw is incredibly alarming. The result and Amorim reverting to his preferred 3-4-3 system, which he himself admitted is not working, is bad enough, but it is made worse when you consider that they went punch-for-punch with Wolves in an evenly matched game, which ended with the worst team in the Premier League having more xG.",
      "United’s overreliance on Matheus Cunha as their sole attacking threat without Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo was clear, with goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee’s breakthrough for his side’s only goal coming via a huge deflection to wrong foot Jose Sa.",
      "This came against the run of play, and Wolves were rewarded for their positive work with an equaliser before the break, with Ladislav Krejci’s header beating Senne Lammens following Zirkzee’s poor attempt at a clearing header.",
      "The second half was similarly back-and-forth as two poor Premier League sides could not be separated, with the full-time whistle and certain baffling substitutions met with boos from the justifiably frustrated home crowd.",
      "Amorim revealed before tonight’s game that he is “not going to ask for more signings” in January to “avoid mistakes”, indicating that he is willing to “suffer now” if it means they will be “two steps ahead in the summer”.",
      "But with Amorim’s side continuing to take one step forward and two back, their attack still blunt without the class of a few individuals and the head coach contributing to another nothing performance after finding a roundabout way to revert to his failing system with square pegs in round holes, he is asking for trouble and may not see out the next phase of “suffering” as goodwill runs thin.",

      "In the summer, Ruben Amorim‘s side improved their attack by signing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they landed Senne Lammens to become their new No.1, but it is clear that they still require upgrades in other areas.",

      "The agent of Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens believes the club were “right” to get rid of Andre Onana, a decision he says they made late in summer.",
      "United suffered through Onana last season, with the former Inter Milan goalkeeper making countless mistakes. They benched him for Altay Bayindir early this season, and Onana’s only United appearance this term came in the League Cup against Grimsby.",
      "He conceded two goals and then 12 penalties as the Red Devils were embarrassingly dumped out of the cup, and that might have been Onana’s last appearance for the club, as he was quickly loaned out to Trabzonspor, with Lammens being signed from Royal Antwerp.",
      "The Belgian’s agent, Mark Volders, has revealed the decision to let Onana go came late in the summer, but has now been vindicated.",
      "“Those critical voices… the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez,” he told HBVL.",
      "“But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust.",
      "“Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.”",
      "Lammens has looked a far more composed presence in the United net, not making the mistakes that Onana did.",
      "Had the Cameroonian remained at the club, Lammens might not have been given the opportunities to show what he could do, so the risk taken by the club has seemingly paid off.",
      "Onana is not having the best spell away from the club, either, as in 13 games at Trabzonspor, he’s conceded 19 goals and has only kept a clean sheet on three occasions.",
      "The situation of Onana further vindicates United’s decision to part company with him and focus their attention on the future with Lammens.",
      "Trabzonspor don’t have an option to buy Onana, but if Lammens keeps playing as he is, they will surely look to sell the Cameroonian in the summer.",
      "Legendary former United keeper Peter Schmeichel is impressed with Lammens, too.",
      "He recently said: “He’s only 23 years old, he’s come in and there’s calm at the back four, there’s not this chaos where they don’t want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man.",
      "“And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he’s not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has insisted that summer signing Senne Lammens will be the Red Devils’ goalkeeper “for the next ten years”.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed why he is not confident about Manchester United’s chances of winning the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The £44m signing has faced stinging criticism at Manchester United and has now been told his Old Trafford ‘career is over’.",
      "We are sick to the back teeth of Premier League footballers being given underserved dues and so we’ve exposed the most overrated stars of every club.",
      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has praised one “outstanding” summer signing and he thinks there are “good signs” under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Man Utd exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed."

      "A respectable nine goals, seven assists and two trophies since suggest he was right not to hesitate.",

      "Considering the Leipzig recruitment model, the idea was likely always to move record signing Simons on eventually at great profit. They likely didn’t expect that to happen within seven months.",
      "Despite the Dutchman’s best efforts, Leipzig failed to qualify for the Champions League in the season they made Simons’ loan permanent. As a result, he informed them of his desire to leave and the poor thing ended up at Spurs of all places.",
      "",
      "Quite comfortably the closest any player has come to replicating what Rodri does for Manchester City, it required a half-season of acclimatisation for Gonzalez to take on board what Pep Guardiola wanted in the middle.",
      "Since then he has become a vital cog in an improving machine. Gonzalez has missed a single game for Manchester City in 2025/26 – and it was one of the few they have lost.",
      "",

      "",
      "It still feels bizarre that Torres played eight more Premier League games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool. The goal haul despite that – 20 at Chelsea and 65 at Liverpool – points to a career trajectory that suffered a sharp fall upon his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "And yet his four years with the Blues yielded a Champions League and Europa League trophy each, with no Anfield trinkets whatsoever.",
      "",
      "Back before Barcelona used economic levers to sign players with money they absolutely didn’t have, the Blaugrana fed their transfer addiction through old-fashioned means like overdrafts and bank loans. We’ve all been there.",
      "They could have plucked Torres from Valencia for £20m or so about 18 months beforehand but shut up that’s why.",

      "The most transformative signing at United since Robin van Persie. Just a shame the club are dragging him down with them.",

      "A miserable end should not obscure a mutually beneficial and temporarily happy union. Only eight players who played in the Premier League era have scored more goals for Arsenal than Aubameyang – and of those players, only Ian Wright and Thierry Henry scored more goals per game. If only he was more punctual and non-negotiable.",
      "",
      "One of football’s greatest mysteries is how Chelsea managed to sell a 29-year-old Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid for £57m despite the striker being very publicly surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge, as painstakingly proven by Antonio Conte’s text message dumping him straight after they won the title together in summer 2017.",
      "Costa had not played professional football for seven months by the time he returned to the Spanish capital; his La Liga record during that second spell was 61 appearances, 12 goals and 17 yellow cards, as well as an eight-game suspension he received for abusing a referee.",

      "",

Chelsea ended up going over and above Fernandez’s 120million euro release clause in exchange for a payment structure that suited their needs. Those needs primarily being ‘spread the cost as much as possible across the massive eight-and-a-half-year contracts we give out now’.",

      "With Fernandes now injured, Amorim has altered the United formation to 4-2-3-1, with Ugarte partnering Casemiro, and Mason Mount playing in the No.10 role.",

      "But the move would be dependent on United letting him go, and while in the summer that might be possible, if they don’t sign a new midfielder in January, with Fernandes currently out and Mount having struggled with injuries in the past, as well as Kobbie Mainoo’s potential exit, it would be a risk for them to allow Ugarte to leave in the middle of the season.",

      "The England international allowed his contract at Anfield to tick down to expiry last summer as Alexander-Arnold made himself unpopular with Liverpool supporters.",
      "Alexander-Arnold was booed on his return to Anfield this season with Real Madrid, who paid a fee to get him out of Liverpool early to play in the Club World Cup, as the Reds got the better of the La Liga side in a 1-0 win in the Champions League.",
      "The former Liverpool star has so far failed to impress in Spain with Alexander-Arnold making just 11 appearances this term, just seven of those coming in the starting XI.",

      "A Real Madrid statement read on December 4: ‘Following tests carried out today on our player Trent Alexander-Arnold by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a muscle injury in the rectus femoris of his left quadriceps. His recovery will be monitored.’",

      "And now Spanish website Fichajes insists that Real Madrid will ‘consider selling’ Alexander-Arnold after receiving ‘some very interesting offers’ ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "The report adds: ‘Among the clubs most closely monitoring his situation are Manchester United and Newcastle United, two ambitious projects looking to bolster their defenses with a proven player. In both cases, offers are reported to be around €40 million. Significant sums, but insufficient to convince Real Madrid, who have no intention of letting him go.’",
      "Fichajes continues: ‘Both Manchester United and Newcastle United know the operation won’t be easy. Both clubs would be willing to submit formal offers if they perceive a change of heart from Real Madrid.",

      "Lineker said in October: “In terms of creativity, as much as anything else, I think they’re really missing Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",

      "“I also think that Mo [Salah] is missing him, that connection that they had. Yes, sometimes they would get exposed in behind, but they would have someone try and cover that position – last season it was mostly [Dominik] Szoboszlai, previous to that would be Jordan Henderson.",
      "“You’ve got to say it was worth his weight in gold going forward, and I always used to say, ‘Stop worrying about him [Alexander-Arnold] making the odd tiny mistake defensively, because what he gives you the other way is incredible.”",

      "Hojlund left an underwhelming spell at Manchester United for a loan to Napoli this term. If certain conditions are met, Hojlund will be signed permanently by the Serie A club in the summer.",
      "Last season for United, Hojlund scored just four goals in the Premier League, with slightly better returns of six in the Europa League.",
      "From just 11 Serie A games this term, he has reached four goals – with two assists – and also has two Champions League goals to his name.",
      "Hojlund seems a better fit in Italy than he was in England, and according to Pazzini, he’s one of the very best strikers in the Serie A.",
      "Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. Since he arrived, he has undergone an incredible transformation.",
      "“He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse. Conte took him, educated him and raised him.",
      "“Now he’s a fantastic striker because he plays for the team, he doesn’t make a single mistake, he never gets anticipated, he plays short, he plays long, he’s vicious in front of goal.",
      "“Now he’s decisive throughout the match and you also find him in the defensive phase.”",
      "Inter Milan striker Martinez is currently the top scorer in Serie A with nine goals, alongside three assists, and Christian Pulisic is the only other player who’s scored more goals than Hojlund this term.",
      "As such, it’s high praise that Hojlund is seen as level with Martinez, who has not failed to surpass 10 Serie A goals in any of the last six seasons, and has 124 goals in the league over his career.",
      "Conte is clearly happy with the progress of the Manchester United loanee, as he said recently: “Hojlund is a player who, first of all, is very young, but above all, has a lot of room for improvement.",
      "“He’s becoming a dominant player in that position. He’s very connected to the team. In my style of football, everyone knows that strikers have a very important and unique role.”",
      "Should the conditions be met for Hojlund to sign permanently at Napoli, they’ll part with €44million (£38.3m) for him. Given he’s currently one of the league’s top scorers and has helped his side to within two points of top spot in Serie A, he seems worth that fee.",
      "A new report has explained why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has been ‘bothered by’ two of his teammates this season.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",

      "Sure, everyone took the p*ss a bit but we still feel like this just isn’t talked about enough. Manchester United should be too embarrassed to leave the house after something like that. But it didn’t even cost anyone their jobs.",

      "He didn’t come from nowhere. We’ve all been dimly aware of the outlandish cartoon villain in charge of Forest and his entertaining ways, but 2025 was his year in so many ways. This was the year where his main-character energy achieved mainstream crossover.",
      "It’s been a spectacularly prickish year for the big man, and who knows what 2026 may bring. We do really quite seriously want to see him run on to the pitch, ageing iPhone in hand, to remonstrate with Sean Dyche as he did so infamously with Nuno Espirito Santo towards the end of last season.",
      "We’re absolutely certain Dyche wouldn’t just stand there and take that utter woke nonsense like beta cuck Nuno did.",
      "That wild incident was key to the whole Marinakis character arc of 2025, though. Because what he was beyond furious about was that Nottingham Forest – Nottingham Forest! – had only managed to draw with Leicester and this had dented their Champions League – Champions League! – chances.",
      "The breathtaking speed with which entitlement took hold of Marinakis and Forest on the back of being Quite Good for Quite A While in an all-time-weak Premier League year was stunning to behold.",
      "Running out of steam on the home straight and not quite making it into the Champions League was, for Marinakis and others, an absolutely unacceptable end to a season that began, as all seasons for all but a handful of teams must, with avoiding relegation trouble as the primary goal.",
      "That Marinakis was so furious with the man more responsible than any other – himself included – for Forest being in a position where he was able to get quite so dangerously high on his own farts was just profoundly ungrateful and enormously Marinakis.",
      "The public nature of that specific outburst cemented his status. He was a main character now. And boy has he spent the rest of the year doubling down on that with some elite villainy.",
      "With Daniel Levy gone, Marinakis is now the Premier League club suit most likely to be pictured sat watching from the stands and requiring commentators, by ancient law, to say ‘penny for his thoughts’.",
      "And the great thing with Marinakis is that you don’t really need to spend that penny. Unlike the expressionless round head of Levy, Marinakis’ thoughts on any situation at any time are writ large across his features. Especially when he’s happy, but especially when he’s angry.",
      "Happy moments of Marinakis behaviour this season have included the entirely normal photo op he staged with Morgan Gibbs-White after convincing the number 10 to sign a new contract entirely and definitely of his own free will. That incident also reminds us that even acts of villainy can have unexpected outcomes; saving Gibbs-White from joining Spurs was far more of a kindness than any of us could have predicted at the time, even allowing for the undeniable and unending fact that Spurs are Spurs.",
      "There was also the undisguised glee he had over Forest’s promotion to the Europa League at Crystal Palace’s expense. We sort of admire the complete lack of pretence there. There was at least an honesty to it rather than some performative attempt at ‘Not the way we wanted to qualify but…’ response.",
      "This season, Marinakis’ core work in maintaining his profile and expanding his role has been to fall back on an old favourite. Manager sackings. Shrewd work. After the wild behaviour of the summer, there was no need to overcomplicate things. Why not simply fall back on a tried-and-trusted tactic?",
      "Nuno was doomed from the moment of that on-pitch dressing down, really. The surprise if anything was that a flimsy and unconvincing ceasefire lasted until a fair way into the new season. But not far enough for Nuno, the man who had just delivered Forest’s best league finish in 30 years, to claim victory in the Premier League Sack Race.",
      "Marinakis was only warming up, though, following that dramatic flourish with his greatest act of hubris yet. So quickly and utterly had Marinakis lost sight of where Forest had been just a year earlier and how quickly they could return to that status, that he appointed Ange Postecoglou.",
      "An absurd decision that still managed to exceed the most dire predictions, which were very dire indeed. And it’s only a matter of time before Dyche goes the same way in 2026 because this is just how Marinakis now rolls.",

      "Sure, it was one thing when he was turning the Club World Cup into the Trump World Cup, because that was only the Club World Cup and nobody gives a sh*t. But we’ve already seen that he is going to do the same and more to make the actual World Cup that we do care about all about him as well.",
      "And football is going to indulge him like the massive Cheeto-hued toddler that he is in the desperate hope that this vast yet desperately insecure ego can be placated to keep him onside enough not to just smash everything to pieces.",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists summer signing Benjamin Sesko has reminded him of former Red Devils striker Louis Saha this season.",
      "Sesko signed for the Red Devils in the summer transfer window in a deal worth around £74m from Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also joined as Man Utd spent almost £200m on new attacking players after being the fifth lowest scoring side in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Sesko has been largely disappointing in his appearances for the Red Devils this season with two goals and one assist in 15 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Ferdinand’s podcast host Joel Beya claimed that Sesko has not “hit the ground running the way he was supposed to” but Stephen Howson reckons he does the dirty work so Cunha and Mbeumo can thrive behind him.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ferdinand added: “I couldn’t agree with Steve more.",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Arsenal v Villa, Eddie Howe on the brink, Man City, Matheus Cunha v Wolves…",
      "“Sesko [offers more] than [just] goals. Yes, the strikers will be judged on their goals, but internally sometimes there are things that they bring to the table that you go, ‘You know what, that is huge’.",
      "“You know who was like that? Louis Saha. He was never going to win the Golden Boot at Manchester United.",
      "“But in terms of his value to the team, he was a joke some of the stuff that he would do to enable others to play better.",
      "“He would get us up the pitch at times, he would hold the ball for three or four seconds at times to give us a breather.",
      "“Forget goals with him. His all-round game… I was sitting there sometimes going, ‘Oh my God, I’m so happy he’s on our team’.",
      "“I think with Sesko, listen, we still want to see the goals. But I’ve seen a few parts of his game that I go, ‘Oh the other players are liking that’.",
      "“I can see it. Manchester United haven’t had a striker who can just hold it up or flick it on for ages. Like just a simple little thing but effective.”",
      "However, former Man Utd striker Teddy Sheringham has been disappointed by what he’s seen and insists the Red Devils should have signed Harry Kane.",
      "Sheringham said last month: “Manchester United are asking too much of Benjamin Sesko. It’s a massive job to lead the line for them, the expectations are enormous.",
      "“It’s always going to be tough for a young, inexperienced striker like Sesko to come into a club like Manchester United and hit the ground running. The club already tried that approach with Rasmus Hojlund and it didn’t work out.",
      "“For me, United should have bought Harry Kane to lead the line when they were searching for a new striker. He would have guaranteed you 20-25 goals every season.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker has questioned whether the Red Devils “sent anyone to actually watch” Benjamin Sesko play before signing him.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are *finally* evolving for the better, but Kobbie Mainoo and five teammates will be the six victims of these changes…",
      "Former Man Utd defender Paul Parker insists that Joshua Zirkzee is “nowhere near the level” of Benjamin Sesko and doubts he will “ever” come good.",
      "Manchester United have been encouraged to re-sign former striker Danny Welbeck from Premier League rivals Brighton and Hove Albion in January.",

      "It’s the time of the year when we are blessed with plenty of midweek Premier League football.",
      "It’s the best part of December, much better than Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve. Unless you’re a Newcastle United fan, who needs more excuses to get drunk and forget all of their problems…until the hangxiety kicks in and they realise their team are 14th in the Premier League.",
      "There are some belting matches. We have a genuine title clash between Arsenal and Aston Villa, while second-place Manchester City face a brilliant Sunderland team in their cauldron.",
      "It’s going to be great. Strap in for a Big Midweek.",
      "",
      "After five games this season, nobody expected Aston Villa to turn things around to the extent that they’d be on an 11-match winning run and in the title race with Arsenal and Manchester City. Back then, they were winless and had only just scored their only 2025/26 Premier League goal. Oh and Liverpool boasted a 100% record. How times have changed.",
      "The most recent Villa win came at Chelsea on Saturday evening, in a true Game of Two Halves. In the opening 45 minutes, Unai Emery’s side might as well not have been there. In the second period, they were absolutely fantastic and two Ollie Watkins goals got them over the line.",
      "It will be a tactical battle between Mikel Arteta and Unai Emery. The latter seems to have his compatriot’s number, especially at the Emirates, which he once called home. Emery has righted the wrongs of his Gunners spell with his outstanding work at Villa Park and seems to have taken his sacking personally – why wouldn’t he? – with a title-denying victory in north London in 2023/24 and a 2-2 comeback draw last season. Not to mention literally beating them 2-1 at home earlier this month.",
      "One big advantage for Arsenal is Villa’s suspensions. Emery will be without right-back Matty Cash and holding midfielder Boubacar Kamara, whose absence really cannot be understated. The Frenchman has been brilliant and incredibly consistent, but having Amadou Onana as a direct replacement isn’t too shabby, while Youri Tielemans is capable of filling Kamara’s role.",
      "But there is no doubt that Kamara’s absence gives Arsenal the edge over their title rivals. Revenge will also be on the mind due to the freshness of Emi Buendía’s last-gasp winner on December 6.",
      "It’s a huge game that is hard to call. Villa’s winning run should make them favourites in any match, and their favourable record under Emery at the Emirates – and how important the aforementioned win and draw were – could give them a psychological boost. Win and the Villans go joint-top on 42 points. Lose and it’s six points, with the rest of the Premier League hoping it’s the start of their title push fading away.",
      "",
      "",
      "We are spoilt for choice in this department. Howe’s opponent on Tuesday, Scott Parker, is someone we suspect is on the brink. And then you have Andoni Iraola, with Bournemouth winless in nine, Nuno Espírito Santo, with West Ham in the bottom three, Rob Edwards, who is reportedly on the brink of being sacked with Wolves still on two points, Enzo Maresca after Chelsea capitulated again, and Thomas Frank, the Spurs head coach on his return to Brentford.",
      "But it has to be Howe.",
      "He has never been closer to the sack. They ought to have scored at Old Trafford, but they didn’t. Their performance at Sunderland was simply pathetic. They have only won once away from home in the Premier League this season. They have five wins on the road in 2025, three of which came between January 4 and March 10.",
      "It feels like Newcastle need a new voice, new ideas, new formations, new signings. They just look like they need change. And unfortunately, despite big players like Anthony Gordon and Sandro Tonali and big signings like Anthony Elanga underperforming, it always comes back to the manager.",
      "The mental and physical edge that Howe’s team once had has completely eluded them all season. They have had first halves like the one against Chelsea, but followed them up with absolutely dismal second halves and capitulations. Late goals have cost them dearly at home, and simply crumbling under the pressure of an away day has become more than a fear…it’s become an expectation.",
      "Not only do Newcastle need a rare away win, but they need to look good. They need to be Howe’s Newcastle at their best. There has to be a glimmer of hope that this team is capable of putting a decent run of results together, and that Howe and his management are what will make something of this season.",
      "But now imagine if they lose at Burnley…",
      "",
      "Man City left it late to see off Nottingham Forest on Saturday, with Rayan Cherki once again providing the goods with a go-ahead assist and match-winning goal. Cherki will likely start in attack with Erling Haaland and Phil Foden when Pep Guardiola’s side face Sunderland away from home on Thursday.",
      "In the 2025/26 Premier League, Sunderland haven’t lost at home and have scored in all nine of their matches. They have beaten Newcastle United, drawn with Aston Villa and Arsenal, and come from 2-0 down to beat Bournemouth 3-2. This is a serious test for City, whose last league defeat came in the north east against the Magpies.",
      "Since then, they’ve won six in a row and also beat Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. They’ve not had the most brutal of fixture lists, but the manner of some victories – three consecutive 3-0s and showing mettle to edge out tough opponents on the road like Forest – have really strengthened their position in the title race with Arsenal.",
      "But there have been examples over the last six games of City wilting. They conceded four at Fulham and almost dropped points from 5-1 up. A tactical switch by Leeds United turned a comfortable 2-0 lead into needing a 91st-minute winner. City are capable of looking very vulnerable, and you’d back Sunderland to make it very uncomfortable for them under the Stadium of Light lights.",
      "It’s another big test of their title credentials and comes 48 hours after Arsenal potentially drop points against Villa. If they do and City win, they’ll go into a matchday above their rivals for the first time since beating Wolves 4-0 on week one.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Villa ‘genius’, ‘irrelevant’ Howe, Raya, Nuno sack, Man Utd and Liverpool",

      "Against his former club on Tuesday, Cunha will be the attacking player Ruben Amorim leans on for inspiration against a historically crap team. Wolves were smashed 4-1 by Manchester United earlier this month but have only narrowly lost at Arsenal and Liverpool since. Perhaps they are more of a threat on the road and shouldn’t be taken lightly by a very unreliable group of players and head coach.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are at the Africa Cup of Nations, Benjamin Sesko’s stock is falling, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes are injured. It’s a crucial game for Cunha and, given the opposition, the perfect opportunity for a statement performance.",
      "Amorim is likely to stick with a back four and how his team attempt to break down a deep block will be very intriguing to see. A pivot of Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro isn’t ideal, while there’s a strong chance young Jack Fletcher starts in the No.10 role, with Patrick Dorgu on the right wing after his winner against Newcastle last Friday.",
      "But in a potentially beatable line-up, Cunha might be the only player you’d back to produce something brilliant. There’s a genuine chance Wolves turn those narrow defeats at Anfield and the Emirates into something better at Old Trafford. This is not a given; nothing is for Man United. But Cunha can and should be the difference-maker against his old club.",
      "",
      "Slim pickings here, but we have a full Football League fixture list on New Year’s Day, which is just fantastic.",
      "Out of all 36 matches on Thursday, we reckon Southampton against Millwall will be the tastiest affair.",
      "Both clubs have promotion aspirations but are on poor runs, winning none of their last three games. They met as recently as November 29, when it finished 3-2 to the Lions, who came from two goals down to win courtesy of a 97th-minute Tristan Crama goal. More of the same, please.",
      "",
      "It would be rude to ignore the wonderful competition that is the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "There’s enough on the line in Group F for the final matchday to be interesting, with Mozambique hoping to cause an upset against Cameroon to knock them down to third.",

      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports.",
      "The Ghanaian forward is one of the hottest properties in the Premier League due to a £65million release clause in his Cherries contract.",
      "Semenyo has been in outstanding form this season, registering nine goals and three assists in 17 Premier League matches.",
      "His performances have caught the attention of the Premier League’s Big Six, with Manchester City and Manchester United emerging as the two frontrunners for his signature.",
      "Liverpool were initially expected to win the race for Semenyo but opted against signing him until it was too late. The winger also “politely” turned down Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea chose not to pursue him, and Arsenal felt they didn’t need another attacker.",
      "Understandably, Semenyo prefers a move to Manchester City over United.",
      "Should he move to the Etihad, he would join a Premier League title contender and feature in the Champions League. On the other hand, a move to Old Trafford would see him join the biggest club in the country, but one without European football and not guaranteed to have it next season.",
      "Now, Ben Jacobs reports that Semenyo’s move to City should be finalized within the next two days.",
      "Writing for talkSPORT, Jacobs states that Bournemouth ‘expect’ the deal to be ‘formalized’ this week for £60m plus add-ons.",
      "Semenyo has already agreed personal terms with City but is still likely to feature against Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday.",
      "The report adds that the deal has advanced ‘following positive talks on Monday over the structure of payments related to Semenyo’s release clause.’",
      "With the timeline confirmed, it’s now looking highly likely that City will secure Semenyo as soon as the January transfer window opens.",
      "The 25-year-old will add further depth to an already stacked attack, which includes Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Phil Foden, and Jeremy Doku.",
      "Semenyo’s ability to play anywhere across the front three makes him a valuable addition for Pep Guardiola, who is aiming for his seventh Premier League title in 10 years.",
      "After three stellar years on the south coast, Semenyo will be another key player in Guardiola’s attacking setup.",

      "Manchester United welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to Old Trafford on Tuesday evening looking to close out 2025 with back-to-back Premier League wins.",
      "After edging past Newcastle United on Boxing Day, United have a chance to build momentum against a Wolves side rooted to the bottom of the table and running out of time.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s team were far from fluent last time out but found a way to win, with Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley settling a tight contest. A switch to a back four saw United concede territory and ride their luck, yet they held firm to secure just their second clean sheet of the league season.",
      "That result continued a steady upturn at Old Trafford. After winning only four of his first 14 home league games, Amorim has now overseen five victories in the last eight, lifting the mood around the club despite ongoing squad disruption.",
      "Still without a league win this season and now 16 points from safety, Wolves have lost 11 straight Premier League games and look increasingly destined for the drop.",
      "United have won eight of the last 11 meetings between the sides, including a 4-1 victory at Molineux earlier this month, and will expect to assert control again against the league’s leakiest defence.",
      "United remain stretched, with Bruno Fernandes still absent and Mason Mount a major doubt after being withdrawn at half-time on Friday.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are all sidelined, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui remain away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is expected to stay involved after an eye-catching performance against Newcastle, having now been directly involved in two goals in as many games. He should again support Benjamin Sesko alongside Matheus Cunha.",
      "(3-4-2-1) Lammens; Yoro, Heaven, Martinez; Dalot, Casemiro, Ugarte, Shaw; Dorgu, Cunha; Sesko",
      "Wolves continue to battle personnel issues, particularly in defence, with Toti Gomes and Emmanuel Agbadou unavailable.",
      "Rodrigo Gomes, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Marshall Munetsi, Daniel Bentley and Tawanda Chirewa are also sidelined, while Hugo Bueno has returned to action.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for form, Tolu Arokodare could continue up front alongside 18-year-old Mateus Mane as Wolves search for solutions.",
      "Sa; Mosquera, S. Bueno, Krejci; Doherty, J. Gomes, Andre, H. Bueno; Hwang, Mane; Arokodare",
      "– Manchester United have won eight of their last 11 Premier League games against Wolves.",
      "– United beat Wolves 4-1 at Molineux earlier this month.",
      "– United kept just their second league clean sheet of the season against Newcastle.",
      "– Patrick Dorgu has been involved in two goals in his last two games after just one involvement in his first 36 appearances.",
      "– Wolves are winless in 18 Premier League matches this season.",
      "– Wolves have lost 25 league games in 2025 and could equal the all-time Premier League record with another defeat.",
      "United should have enough to take all three points, but their defensive record suggests Wolves will not be completely shut out.",
      "Amorim’s side remain vulnerable at the back and have struggled for clean sheets all season, even in games they control.",
      "Wolves continue to lose, yet they have competed in spells under Rob Edwards and should find opportunities against a United defence that has rarely looked settled. That makes backing United to win while conceding a goal a sensible middle ground.",
      "Man United to win and both teams to score appeals here, especially given Wolves’ tendency to stay involved before eventually falling short.",
      "United’s matches have rarely stayed tight, while Wolves’ defence continues to give up chances in volume. Over 2.5 goals fits the pattern of how both sides’ games have played out across the season."

      "United missed out on the chance to go fourth and became the first side to drop points to Wolves since October after a run of 11 consecutive defeats as Amorim's side were booed off by their own fans at Old Trafford.",
      "\"They weren't just booed off at full-time. The fans waited in the stadium to continue to boo them.\"",
      "United were flat from the off but led through Joshua Zirkzee's deflected strike before Wolves scored a deserved equaliser just before half-time through Ladislav Krejci's header.",
      "Neville was surprised Amorim had not stuck with the back four that earned a big win over Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, given his only change was Zirkzee for the injured Mason Mount.",
      "Just 20 minutes into the game, he had said: \"This isn't right. I've watched enough of United over the last five or six weeks to know what looks right and what isn't right.\"",
      "Neville was no more impressed by United's performance as the game wore on, with Wolves coming close to claiming their first win of the season only to be denied by two crucial Senne Lammens saves.",
      "\"The reason he's had to change is because the performance levels with the 3-4-3 have been so poor and the results have been appalling.",
      "\"When I see that we go back [to three at the back] after five minutes tonight and I'm thinking, no, Ruben, why have you done that?,\" Neville added.",
      "\"The manager has to look at that and think, I got that wrong. I complicated it.\"",
      "Neville was once again critical of Amorim's substitutions after he decided to take off Zirkzee at half-time despite having a bench with five teenagers on it.",
      "Amorim explained after the game that it was a tactical decision to remove Zirkzee rather than due to an injury.",
      "\"They made Manchester United worse,\" Neville said of the changes. \"Every single substitution was bizarre.",
      "\"If Zirkzee wasn't injured and that was a tactical substitution, it was a really poor one. Zirkzee isn't Eric Cantona, by any stretch of the imagination, but he needed to be out there for physicality, for presence, for experience.",

      "It was a dismal display by Ruben Amorim's side on a night they could have moved into the top four with a victory, but they could hardly claim to deserve the points as Rob Edwards picked up his first point as Wolves head coach at the eighth attempt.",
      "After beating Newcastle with a back four, Amorim returned to his favoured three-man defence for the visit of Wolves and United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee's shot deflected in off Ladislav Krejci. Benjamin Sesko struck the post soon afterwards.",
      "But United, seeking back-to-back clean sheets for the first time under Amorim, allowed Wolves back into it and needed Senne Lammens to save well from Hugo Bueno even before Zirkzee's misdirected clearance was latched onto by Krejci for the leveller.",

      "Patrick Dorgu did have a goal disallowed for offside in the 90th minute but it would have been scarcely deserved given that it was Lammens who produced the better stops. Amorim's substitutions - including that of Ayden Heaven - only baffled the home crowd.",
      "In failing to beat a team that had lost their last 12 games in all competitions, United missed the chance to move into the top four. Wolves' predicament remains grim, this just their third point of the season. But it was their night. And it is Amorim facing questions.",
      "\"I feel really disappointed. We can't come here at home and draw in this game. We have to win when we play at home and the opponents have to suffer. It is very frustrating.\"",

      "\"There will be a painful aftermath for Ruben Amorim. He will point to injuries and AFCON but every team is in a similar situation. I am not sure what happened with Zirkzee. If he is not injured, it is a bizarre substitution to make.\"",

      "There are extenuating circumstances, clearly. Manchester United are without some of their most creative players right now. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are injured.",
      "But when you draw at home to a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches in all competitions, there will be scrutiny. Particularly when Ruben Amorim switched back to his favoured back three to 'match up' with a side still winless in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim talked of the difficulty in relying on inexperienced players afterwards but he introduced one - Jack Fletcher - when removing Joshua Zirkzee, United's goalscorer, at the interval. \"It was tactical,\" he confirmed. They could not deal with Wolves' midfield, he argued.",
      "If that change was strange, the like-for-like substitution of Ayden Heaven - perhaps United's best outfield player again - for Leny Yoro was also difficult for supporters to understand. They booed that late switch, having booed the team off at half-time and full-time.",
      "Amorim remains confident, he insists, that United will be far stronger when his stars are back but the frustration is that the opportunity is being missed in the here and now. His team could have gone fourth with a better display against the bottom club.",
      "Five of the last seven games in which they have scored first have not been won. Home games against 10-man Everton, a woeful West Ham, a Bournemouth side they were beating three times and now this Wolves team, adrift in the table, have not been won.",
      "And the worry is that Amorim is a big part of the reason for that. The man in whom everyone is supposed to trust sometimes feels like a stumbling block to success rather than the architect of it. Leeds and Burnley await. Those games come with real risk now.Adam Bate",
      "Martin Odegaard's role in Arsenal's second goal against Aston Villa typified all he brings Mikel Arteta's side at his best. First, the off-the-ball alertness to pounce on Youri Tielemans' loose pass. Then a through-ball so perfectly measured that Martin Zubimendi didn't even need to break his stride.",
      "His starring performance at the Emirates Stadium came only three days after he performed to a similarly high level in the win over Brighton. It's a goal and an assist in two games for him now but those numbers do not tell the full story.",
      "After an injury-hit start to the season, the Arsenal captain finally looks back at something approaching his best form. He led Arsenal players for touches, final-third passes, chances created and shots on Tuesday night, his influence clear.",
      "For Mikel Arteta, it was only ever a question of time. \"He needed some consistency as well and some games,\" he said in his press conference. \"Obviously, he had two times the shoulder injury, then he had a big knee injury, and that takes a little bit of time.",
      "\"Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, and that he's affecting the game in a great way.",
      "\"I think he was very, very good today.\"",
      "His work on the ball against Villa was complemented by a familiar level of intensity out of possession. Odegaard contested more duels than any other Arsenal player and won possession the most times too. Only Zubimendi ran further than his 11.2km.",
      "Carry on like this, in all facets of his game, and a player who has come to split opinion among Arsenal supporters could prove a difference-maker in the Premier League title race.Nick Wright",
      "Mateus Mane delivered a player of the match performance for Wolves in their shock draw at Manchester United and in a season in which the supporters have been starved of positives, the 18-year-old academy prospect has become the fans' new darling.",
      "They chanted his name throughout, a new song to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries, and roared with delight when he tackled former favourite Matheus Cunha. Mane played with energy and quality, just days after lasting the full 90 minutes at Anfield.",
      "It is the tactical flexibility that has impressed Rob Edwards. A more natural winger, he was moved inside midway through the game against Liverpool and had been lined up for a No 10 role at Old Trafford until Santi Bueno's withdrawal forced a change of plan.",
      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",
      "Newcastle have looked their best under Eddie Howe when they play with speed, aggression and verticality.",
      "That edge has been missing at times this season, especially away from home.",
      "Where Nick Woltemade offers presence, structure and link play between the lines, Yoane Wissa brings a bit of chaos and directness. He runs the channels, pulls centre-backs wide and asks uncomfortable questions of defensive units that want to hold a compact shape.",
      "Against Burnley, that difference was obvious within minutes and Newcastle managed to score twice inside seven of them.",
      "Two goals in two starts, capped by a decisive contribution in the win over Burnley, has quickly thrust Wissa back into the spotlight.",
      "The early signs suggest Newcastle now have two different attacking profiles for different types of games.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had the suspensions of Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara to add to a four-player injury list against Arsenal. The result was a weakened starting line-up and a depleted bench which included three untested teenagers.",
      "Unai Emery might now have to add Amadou Onana to the absentee list against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Aston Villa were matching Arsenal at the time of his enforced withdrawal due to injury at half-time. It all went wrong after that.",
      "Arsenal were excellent in the second period, of course, but they were also far fresher, with Villa having played out a similarly draining away game against Chelsea only three days earlier. They had gone to their limits to extend their winning run to 11 games.",
      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton boss David Moyes praised his squad, with specific reference to players like Nathan Patterson who came into the game short of regular minutes, following the 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Injuries to Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz for this fixture only added to their problems. Moyes said he was working with around 30 per cent of the squad after the game and he was right.",
      "Through a combination of international duty at AFCON and injuries, Everton are threadbare.",
      "Only two players on their bench this evening - Jack Grealish and Beto - had a Premier League appearance to their name.",
      "The Toffees are within touching distance of the top five but if they want to keep that positioning - or even build on it - they need reinforcements.",
      "Waiting for players to return isn't enough. The January transfer window could be arriving at the perfect time.Patrick Rowe",
      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has praised West Ham's spirit but that only takes you so far. Barring a few Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta moments, there needs to be more quality in this Hammers team, or 2026 is the year they go down.Sam Blitz",
      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "But they may accelerate their interest in Diomande if other clubs start moving for the highly rated young forward in this window.",
      "There are other big clubs keen on Diomande, a 19-year-old Ivory Coast international who is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with United winger Amad Diallo.",
      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-German are also thought to be tracking his development closely.",
      "The teenager has scored seven goals and contributed four assists in 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig this season.",
      "Diomande has started both of Ivory Coast's matches at AFCON and has two goals in five appearances for his country.",
      "Speaking to Marcel Schafer alongside a number of other reporters in September, the RB Leipzig managing director for sport held up Diomande as an example of a \"young jewel\" identified as part of the club's rebuild this season following such a disappointing season.",
      "After eight consecutive European campaigns, Leipzig missed out on continental competition for the first time since their ascension to the German top flight and the signing of Diomande from Spanish side Leganes reflected the need for a refresh.",
      "\"He definitely fits in the profile we are looking for,\" Schafer explained. \"Young, hungry and high potential. Even though he was just six months in Spain, he had really some impressive appearances in LaLiga and we looked for these kind of players.\"",
      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",
      "The teenager scored on his Leipzig debut in the cup before netting in three consecutive appearances in October and bagging a hat-trick against Freiburg just before travelling out to Morocco to represent Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "The prospect of losing Diomande so quickly would not have been part of the plan when they paid €20m to sign him in the summer but Leipzig are pragmatic about their business model, honing young talent and selling them on for a significant profit.",
      "\"Yan is an outstanding talent, a high-potential profile and we exactly looked for this profile. Yes, it was a certain amount we spent but there were so many clubs in competition to sign him. So we are really happy, really proud to sign a young jewel.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 18:10, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title and it has already been put to the test with a raft of injuries.",
      "Mikel Arteta has said Arsenal \"have to be actively looking\" at the market in January after losing more players than they had anticipated.",
      "Arsenal will always keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal have been looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON.",
      "Palace have agreed a £34m deal with Tottenham for Brennan Johnson but the winger is yet to make a final decision over his future.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Signing a centre-back is also a possibility in January for Leeds after the change in formation to 3-5-2 if the right deal materialises, although improving the forward line is the priority.",
      "The Leeds boss has shown his team's flexibility in recent games by switching to a back four mid-game to come back in draws against Liverpool, Brentford and Sunderland and so the club have options to manage the centre-back situation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United look set to miss out on Antoine Semenyo to rivals Manchester City but spending £65m on the winger in January could have potentially reduced their summer budget.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for the likes of Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Crystal Palace have agreed a £34m fee with Spurs for Johnson, who is yet to make a final decision over his future amid interest from Bournemouth. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season.",
      "Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Rayan Cherki's creativity for Man City and how his form changes the Premier League title picture. Plus: Jeremie Frimpong's pace helping Liverpool and Ayden Heaven's growing reputation at Man Utd",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 11:20, UK",
      "It was not until the start of November that Pep Guardiola left Rayan Cherki on the pitch for over an hour of a Premier League game. The player provided two assists that day against Bournemouth and has started eight of the last nine Premier League games.",
      "Manchester City have won all but one of them to reignite their title hopes and Cherki's role in that has been significant. Most obviously, he scored the winner against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. But his assist for the opener was more typical.",
      "Cherki has provided seven Premier League assists since the start of November, more than any other player in the competition in that time. It is more than twice as many as all but two players - Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Fulham's Harry Wilson.",
      "The difference is that while Fernandes and Wilson are the set-piece takers for their respective teams, all seven of Cherki's assists have come from open play. No other Premier League player has more than three assists from open play during this period.",
      "The key for Guardiola has been getting Cherki in possession of the ball in those areas of the pitch where he can cause the most problems for the opposition. At Forest, although many of those touches were on the right, he was able to do damage centrally.",
      "All three of the chances that he created, including for Tijjani Reijnders' goal, came from forward passes from central positions. Since the start of November, no player in the Premier League has completed more through-balls than the France international.",
      "Tellingly, that game against the Cherries was the first time that Guardiola had named Cherki and Phil Foden in the same starting line-up. It is seven wins from eight in all competitions with them together since then, the twin playmakers proving crucial.",
      "Back in October, the best case for City reclaiming the title relied on Erling Haaland bludgeoning opponents and covering up the flaws in this team. Now, something is taking shape. There is more to this City. Cherki's impact highlights that clearly.",
      "Rob Edwards was encouraged by Wolves' start but about a quarter of an hour into their game at Liverpool, it changed. \"Liverpool began to force us back,\" he explained. \"They changed one or two bits and got a lot of numbers high so it was hard for us to get out.\"",
      "It was around that time that Arne Slot could be seen on the touchline urging Jeremie Frimpong to move higher up. In the latter stages of the first half at Anfield, the nominal right-back played right up against Wolves' back line. It brought the breakthrough goal.",
      "\"Last week, he had the assist against Tottenham and today he had a great assist against Wolves,\" said Slot when discussing Frimpong in the press conference afterwards. \"Pace, that is what he has and that is so important and crucial in modern-day football.\"",
      "He explained: \"To create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces. Now that is not our biggest strength.\" But Frimpong's pace can help them open teams up another way.",
      "He raced past two Wolves players before crossing for Ryan Gravenberch to score. \"Pure individual ability - quick, bam, bam and a cut-back cross. Okay, we were positioned in the right position, but that is the pace I always wanted to bring in in the summer.\"",
      "This was only Frimpong's second Premier League start since his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, injury hampering his first half-season in a Liverpool shirt. \"Now, if he is fit, he can definitely help us.\" The opening goal in beating Wolves showed precisely why.",
      "A word too for Ayden Heaven, who earned Gary Neville's player of the match award in Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven produced eight clearances and one vital block to help preserve a precious clean sheet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's switch to a back four was a major talking point but whatever the formation it seems that the teenage defender has forced himself into the plans. It is now five starts in a row since coming in for the first time this season against West Ham.",
      "\"I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you do not feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game. No, you feel that he is improving during the game.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So in this moment, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "One recalls Hayden being presented to the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford in February following his signing from Arsenal and there being no great sense that he was someone who would have a significant role to play before the calendar year was out.",
      "United lost that game 2-0 to Crystal Palace with Leny Yoro in the team and now Heaven appears to be ahead of the young Frenchman in Amorim's pecking order. Like Yoro, his progress is unlikely be linear. There will be setbacks. But Heaven's reputation is growing.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",
