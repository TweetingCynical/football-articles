      "Ruben Amorim has confessed that Manchester United's growing struggles are his fault - and he could consider handing over the reigns if he cannot change the team's direction of travel.",
      "United will post their worst ever Premier League finish this season with West Ham the latest side to win at Old Trafford. Amorim was appointed in November to replace Erik ten Hag, but hasn't enjoyed any new manager bounce with the team going backwards.",
      "Amorim was hired off the back of his success at Sporting Lisbon, where he was a title winner, but he has struggled to find a winning formula in Manchester. The team are in the midst of a seven match winless run - with five of those being defeats.",
      "Their home record has made for grim reading with Amorim, who bought his unique 3-4-3 system with him, unable to get his players to operate as he hoped. However he's maintained that any issues are up to him - not his players - and he understands he must fix their crisis as soon as possible.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\".",
      "Amorim added: \"I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "\"So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.\"",
      "Amorim has not been shy in speaking his mind since being appointed in Manchester. After a defeat several months ago he admitted that he was leading \"maybe the worst Manchester United team in history\" such was their poor run of form.",
      "The Portuguese coach, who was highly-rated before coming to the Premier League, had requested to join at the end of the season, but was told he had to arrive mid-season or miss out on the job all together.",
      "Amorim’s side went into Sunday’s game buoyed by securing their place in the make-or-break Bilbao showpiece against Tottenham with Thursday’s 4-1 victory against Athletic Bilbao, completing an impressive 7-1 semi-final triumph.",
      "But United have failed to carry their European form onto the domestic front, with their worst-ever Premier League season continuing as Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed West Ham a memorable 2-0 victory on the road.",
      "The East Londoners ended an eight-game winless run by securing their first league victory at Old Trafford since Carlos Tevez struck 18 years ago."

      "No wonder Ruben Amorim admits he never knows which version of his Manchester United side will turn up. Just 72 hours after beating Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate to reach the Europa League final, Amorim and his players were cast back in their familiar role this season as the Premier League's laughing stock.",
      "Since taking over in November, Amorim has overseen 25 Premier League games, losing 13 and winning just six, to leave United languishing down in 16th place. This defeat was their 17th in the league this season, the most since they were relegated in 1974, with United having lost more league games at home this season than away – nine at Old Trafford compared to eight on the road.",
      "No wonder there were great swathes of empty red seats all around the stadium, long before the final whistle. It is a truly abysmal record, one that would surely have got Amorim the sack at the end of the season, were it not for an all or nothing shot at redemption in the shape of the Europa League final.",
      "Just as winning the FA Cup last season saved Erik ten Hag, albeit only for a few months, lifting the Europa League trophy in Bilbao on May 21 is likely to prolong Amorim's tenure.",
      "But defeat to Tottenham in the San Mames Stadium, on the back of such a lamentable domestic campaign, will see legitimate questions asked about Amorim's future. Even though Amorim made six changes to the side that overcame Bilbao, there was enough talent and experience within his starting line-up to produce a more competitive performance than the limp offering that has become an all-too familiar story for United this season.",
      "In contrast, West Ham were ebullient from start to finish and worthy winners, taking the lead in the 26th minute, with former United full-back Aaaron Wan-Bissaka playing Mohammed Kudus in behind the home defence. Kudus feigned to cross, fooling Amad and allowing him time and space to drill a delivery into the six-yard box, where Tomas Soucek was waiting to turn the ball over the line.",
      "It was no more than the visitors deserved, after a confident and enterprising start to the game, in contrast to the hosts, who lacked fluency in their build-up play and had no cutting edge up front. Rasmus Hojlund, with just four Premier League goals all season, continued to toil up front, his ineffective display underlining the need for United to sign a prolific and proven scorer this summer, to lead their insipid attack.",
      "Hojlund found himself through on goal just after the half-hour mark, courtesy of a delivery from Manuel Ugarte, but the £72million forward produced a slapstick attempt at controlling the ball, which flew off his right boot and behind for a goal-kick.",
      "James Ward-Prowse was presented with a chance to double West Ham's lead two minutes after the restart, but sent his low shot straight at United keeper Altay Bayindir. But Graham Potter's side made it 2-0 in the 57th minute, Ugarte weak in possession and giving up the ball cheaply under pressure from Wan-Bissaka, enabling Kudus to surge towards the United goal.",
      "Kudus saw his shot blocked, the ball spun to Wan-Bissaka, who picked out Jarrod Bowen at the far post, the West Ham skipper presented with the simplest of finishes from close-range. Hojlund looked certain to score with 11 minutes left, but Alphonse Areola pulled off a fine save at point-blank range to deny him, moments after sub Harry Haguire had flashed a header wide."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim was left with his head in his hands after being told about the extent of Leny Yoro's injury. The French defender was forced off during their defeat to West Ham.",
      "United were beaten yet again at Old Trafford, but their woes were deepened by the injury to Yoro, which could rule him out of the Europa League final in 10 days time. The 19-year-old received treatment for an injury early in the second half but was unable to continue, with Harry Maguire having to come on.",
      "Amorim was getting the debrief from a United medic in the aftermath of Yoro's withdrawal and was evidently gutted by the news he received.",
      "Yoro will undergo scans to determine the extent of his injury, but he will need a quick recovery if he is to feature in the European final in Bilbao a week on Wednesday - which has huge Champions League implications.",
      "United have been playing weakened teams since beating Athletic Bilbao in the first-leg of their semi-final, but against the Hammers chose to play a number of their leading lights - Luke Shaw, Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Amad among them.",
      "Amorim's decision to play some of his regulars didn't halt their poor Premier League form as United lost for a fifth time in seven games. It was also in stark contrast to the much changed line-up he fielded during the loss at Brentford last weekend.",
      "Before that game he said: \"Maybe some kids will have to play against Brentford. We have some problems in our squad. Some players are in the limit. We will try to manage everything and the best way is to prepare for all these things. We'll see what we can do at the weekend.\"",
      "Despite United having nothing to play for domestically Amorim's decision to name a team with the majority of his regulars looks to have backfired. Even with several of their big guns playing the Red Devils' poor record at Old Trafford continued against West Ham.",
      "It was a loss to the Hammers earlier this season that resulted in Erik ten Hag's sacking. Graham Potter's side have now completed the double over the Manchester outfit with Tomas Soucek scoring in the first-half before Jarrod Bowen made the game safe."

      "Ruben Amorim has cut ties with two of the three Manchester United stars who 'let Erik Ten Hag down' when the Red Devils were beaten by West Ham in 2024. Ten Hag was finally sacked as head coach of the Red Devils in late October following a woeful start to the season.",
      "Less than 24 hours before his exit, the Dutchman's United had suffered a 2-1 defeat by West Ham, courtesy of a controversial last-gasp penalty from Jarrod Bowen, after winning only four of their 14 games to start the campaign.",
      "United faced the Hammers for the first time since that fateful fixture this Sunday at Old Trafford. Both sides are enduring torrid seasons as they sit way down in the bottom half of the table. Amorim's men lost 2-0 in yet another afternoon to forget.",
      "And it was extremely telling that, just over six months after Ten Hag's sacking, two of the three players he reportedly took issue with were not only not involved against West Ham, but no longer at the club.",
      "It's fair to say that the majority of the Dutchman's squad was sub-par throughout his tenure. But the Daily Star reported at the time that the head coach was particularly frustrated by Casemiro, Antony and Marcus Rashford, who he believed were partially responsible for his exit.",
      "Rashford only scored once in the league this season under Ten Hag and has spent the past year making headlines for the wrong reasons.",
      "The misfiring striker's long-term dip in form left his manager without a goal-scorer, having managed to net 17 (30 in all competitions) during Ten Hag's debut season.",
      "Meanwhile, Casemiro also suffered a dip in form after an impressive first season at Old Trafford. He suddenly appeared to lack the fitness required at the top level and made several errors leading to goals, which didn't help the Dutchman's cause.",
      "Antony, too, was specifically signed by Ten Hag for a whopping £86million in the hope that he'd recreate the performances he displayed under the manager at Ajax. He came nowhere near justifying that price tag in the end and stained Ten Hag's transfer record.",
      "Amorim, who took the helm in November, appears to share his predecessor's feelings. He used Antony sparingly and froze Rashford out of his squad in late 2024, before sending them out on loan in January to Real Betis and Aston Villa, respectively.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, has also been used sparingly by the Portuguese in the league. He has been left on the bench as an unused substitute 13 times since his arrival.",
      "While Antony and Rashford appear to have played their last games as United players, the Brazilian midfielder at least has the opportunity to lift some silverware when the Red Devils take on Tottenham in the Europa League final on May 21."

      "West Ham ensured Manchester United's Premier League woes continued as the Red Devils matched their longest run without a win in the competition. They have failed to earn three points in their last seven matches for the first time since 1992.",
      "The Irons' 2-0 victory saw them end a 16-game winless run at Old Trafford and secure a record of winning four of their last five meetings against the 13-time Premier League champions. United showed some positive play in the early stages but it was the visitors who were able to find a way through.",
      "Brilliant build-up play saw Aaron Wan-Bissaka play in Mohammed Kudus, who smartly sent Amad to the floor before firing the ball across the box. Tomas Soucek was on hand to nudge the ball between Harry Amass' legs and into the net from close range.",
      "United showed all of the quality their league position suggests in the second period as Manuel Ugarte quickly fell to the floor under pressure in his own half to spark another attack for the Irons. Wan-Bissaka was involved again to provide a perfect ball across the six-yard box for Jarrod Bowen to double his side's lead.",
      "Mason Mount, Amad, Luke Shaw and Kobbie Mainoo all came off the bench and sparked a change in United's second leg Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao. They were tasked with impressing from the start as Ruben Amorim's stars now all vie for a place to play in the European final.",
      "A curling cross-field ball from Mount to Amad hinted at what could be unleashed from the troop at their best, and the latter often proved to be full of pace and tempo to provide a threat. But one again, as with most United stars this season, there were difficult moments.",
      "Mainoo struggled in an advanced position that had seen Bruno Fernandes dropped deeper, and Luke Shaw's positioning was far from perfect in a back three. There will be tough decisions to make ahead of the Europa League final and Amad probably has the best chance to keep his place for now.",
      "While some players will be performing with an eye on facing Spurs in Bilbao, otherwise will be hoping to prove to Amorim that they are worthy of a squad spot next year and others, perhaps their next club.",
      "Altay Bayindir started his second Premier League game in succession for the Red Devils and likely faces the prospect of playing to show his ability to a new team, should he want to find first time football. The Turkish ace earned his spot in net with Andre Onana being rested and despite the No.1's failures this season, Bayindir has failed to offer an argument he should take his position.",
      "Sunday saw an unconvincing outing for the goalkeeper who was unable to provide an authorative presence and showed some questionable communication. Tested early in the second period by James Ward-Prowse, Bayindir stood up to the task but he may be required to do more to have teams knocking at the door and to turn slow down United's search for a new shotstopper.",
      "In the opposite net, Alphonse Areola proved to be a wall as United knocked on the door in the second half and pulled off an impressive 79th-minute save to deny Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Leny Yoro looked downbeat as he was guided off the pitch with an injury. Never a good sign with a final to come in 10 days time. Ruben Amorim's team selections have been hampered by injury in recent months, and even for this game Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Toby Collyer were all watching on from the directors' box.",
      "Amorim immediately replaced Luke Shaw alongside Yoro, seeming to want to protect the player as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof came into play. There could certainly be a nervous week for United as they prepare for their lone chance at success this season.",
      "Only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton had earned fewer points than the Irons since Graham Potter's first match in charge of the club. They had been winless in eight games heading to Old Trafford where winning is not something the Londoners experience often.",
      "Potter managed to see United's central weakness and offered Mohammed Kudus plenty of freedom to cause the home side issues throughout the game. Given their position in the league, few teams offer better chance to pick up three points than United and Potter's side ultimately took advantage.",
      "Earning three points at the Theatre of Dreams will offer an important boost to West Ham's boss, and its reputation will offer some credibility even with United's deficiencies. It was critical for Potter to find that heading into next season.",
      "From a United perspective, given another defeat, you would hope not. Heading into the afternoon, the highest the club could finish was 12th and a positive result for the Hammers would see them leapfrog their hosts.",
      "\"We can't save anything from the Premier League,\" Amorim said ahead of the game. \"But we do have to acknowledge we are - and we need to win games.\"",
      "It was not on the agenda at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Red Devils had big chances but perhaps offered their opponents better ones.",
      "The club are in a battle for 17th and avoiding that will likely take a backseat to any European aspirations. Wins will be wanted, but that does not feel in United's control in the division."

      "Despite their struggles in domestic competitions, Ange Postecoglou's side have managed to defeat the Red Devils three times this season. For Spurs, lifting the trophy would break a 17-year drought, while for United, it could provide a silver lining to a disappointing season.",
      "It's worth noting that the Europa League winners automatically secure a spot in next season's Champions League. However, for United, this might not be a given.",
      "Previous UEFA rules stated that two clubs under the same ownership can't compete in different European competitions. As Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stakes in both Man United and Ligue 1 team Nice, it would have been impossible for both clubs to play in Europe.",
      "Despite a 2-0 loss to Rennes on Saturday, Nice are well-positioned to qualify for next season's Champions League as they currently sit fourth in the Ligue 1 table.",
      "Last year, the regulations were tweaked to accommodate multiple clubs under the same ownership, with each case being evaluated individually. This is evident in Manchester City and Girona, both part of the City Group, participating in this season's tournament.",
      "United have already encountered issues due to Ratcliffe's involvement with Nice, as seen when Jean-Clair Todibo's move to Old Trafford was blocked. However, there are two reasons for United to remain optimistic about the situation.",
      "Ratcliffe is reportedly considering selling the French club. If the sale goes through before a specific date, assuming United wins the Europa League and Nice secures a Champions League qualification spot, there should be no problems.",
      "Furthermore, it has been clarified that there isn't a one-size-fits-all rule for every situation. Even if Ratcliffe retains stakes in both clubs, there's still a possibility for both to compete among Europe's top teams, as indicated by a UEFA statement.",
      "The statement asserted that \"no one is simultaneously involved, directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition; and no one has control or decisive influence over more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\"",
      "Therefore, all that's really required is evidence that the two clubs aren't managed concurrently. Ratcliffe's intention to sell his stake in Nice could certainly strengthen their case if the worst happens."

      "The German side could only claim the DFL-Supercup for silverware as Bayern Munich became league champions once again. However, Schick's return to goal-scoring prowess could result in the 29-year-old earning a move abroad. The likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, and Arsenal have been linked to signing the striker after five years at Leverkusen.",
      "The Czech international first cut his teeth in Germany during a loan spell with RB Leipzig in the 2019/20 season from Roma. It turned out to be a success with the striker netting 10 goals in 22 league games, with the side finishing third in the league and reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League.",

Leipzig was absolutely the right choice for my career. I had also talked to Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke here in Germany.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's plans to sell Nice have suffered a blow after the French side missed out on automatic qualification for the league phase of the Champions League. Ratcliffe, through his company Ineos, bought Nice back in the summer for 2019 for around £85million.",
      "He has endured a rocky time at the Allianz Riviera though, with the regime deeply unpopular among supporters. Ratcliffe has increasingly turned his focus away from Nice and onto Manchester United.",
      "Despite that lack of attention, Nice have enjoyed their most successful season yet since Ratcliffe took over. After losing manager Francesco Farioli to Ajax last summer following a fifth place finish, Franck Haise was appointed in his place.",
      "With one game to play, Haise has all but secured European football for his side. They currently sit in fourth place, but are level on points with both Lille in fifth and Strasbourg in sixth.",
      "Due to Ligue 1's diminishing status in European football, only the top three in Ligue 1 qualify automatically for the league phase of the Champions League. With one game remaining, Nice cannot catch third-place Monaco, who sit four points ahead of them.",
      "Les Aiglons must beat Brest on the final day to secure their fourth place finish. But they will then face the arduous test of the qualifying rounds, with Ligue 1's fourth-place team entering at the third stage.",
      "That would mean a two-leg play-off for Nice at the start of August, before a final play-off round at the end of that month. Nice's chances of finishing in the top three were dashed by a poor defeat away at mid-table Rennes on Saturday.",
      "Two goals from Arnaud Kalimuendo secured the three points for the hosts. He first turned in a cross from Ludovic Blas after 15 minutes, before breaking through to finish past Marcin Bulka late on.",
      "Missing out on automatic qualification is a serious blow for Ratcliffe's hopes of selling the team. It was revealed last week that the billionaire is looking to move on from the South of France.",
      "He has engaged New York-based investment bank Lazard to find a buyer, with the hope of bringing in £213m. A 'blind trust' have been operating Nice this season, with neither Ineos nor Ratcliffe having 'control or decisive influence' at the club.",
      "That was due to UEFA rules around multi-club operations as both United and Nice qualified for the Europa League. Bringing in such a large fee is already complicated by the TV rights crisis in French football.",

      "\"With Nice, in the French league, you can buy a club for £100million. It’s much cheaper access. But I don’t particularly enjoy going to watch Nice because there are some good players but the level of football is not high enough for me to get excited,\" he told The Times.",
      "“The best season that Nice has had is this one where we’ve not been allowed to get involved because of multi-club ownership rules. They’ve been so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson there as well, you know.\""

      "It's been 20 years since the Glazer family took the reins at Manchester United. The takeover in May 2005 sparked protests from around 300 United fans outside Old Trafford, and even led to Bobby Charlton issuing a public apology to the owners for their frosty welcome.",
      "Fast forward to 2025, and the family has splashed out more than £2billion on transfers in a bid to secure Premier League and Champions League success, yet they continue to be a bone of contention among the United faithful.",
      "Despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS acquiring a minority stake in the club last February, with aspirations of injecting new life into the club by taking over football operations, there's been little improvement on the pitch.",

      "More investment is definitely needed in the upcoming summer transfer window if the board hopes to turn things around under latest manager Ruben Amorim, but it hasn't always been doom and gloom in the north west.",
      "In fact, some of the first signings made under the new era at Old Trafford went on to have stellar careers with the Red Devils under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Van der Sar was instrumental in helping United clinch the Premier League title in the 2006/07 season, and followed it up with a league, Community Shield, and Champions League treble the next year – showcasing his skills particularly during a nail-biting European final penalty shootout against Chelsea.",
      "With four Premier League titles to his name, Van der Sar bid farewell to United in 2011, having made 266 appearances in total. He left as the club's best goalkeeper since Peter Schmeichel's departure in 1999.",
      "In his post-playing career, Van der Sar became Ajax's marketing director in 2012 before being promoted in late 2016 to the role of CEO. But in May 2023, he resigned from his post.",
      "Just a month after Van der Sar's arrival in the north west, the Red Devils secured the signing of Ji-sung Park from PSV for £4m. The midfielder's transfer marked him as only the second Asian player to sign for the club, following Dong Fangzhuo in 2004.",
      "Although Park didn't score as many goals as fans had anticipated, he was a key part of Ferguson's squad and featured in 45 matches in his first season. Despite his second year being marred by injury, he still managed to secure a Premier League winners' medal after netting five goals in 14 games.",
      "He was also part of the team that clinched the 2008 Champions League title, although he was left out of the squad for the final by Ferguson in a tough call. Park's most fruitful season came in 2010/11 when he netted eight goals in 28 matches before moving to QPR at the end of the season. He retired after returning to former club PSV Eindhoven for the 2013/14 season.",
      "Park completed his coaching badges as he took charge of QPR's Under-16 side as part of his coaching B license. After leaving the west Londoners, Park joined K League 1 side Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors as their technical director in 2022. There, he appointed ex-Chelsea star Dan Petrescu as manager, but the Romanian's time in charge didn't last long as he resigned mid-season.",
      "Park then became an advisor at the club, who opted for another former Chelsea man in the form of Gus Poyet, as he was announced as manager last year.",
      "Ferguson spotted Ben Foster while he was playing for Wrexham in the Football League Trophy final and snapped him up for United for £1m in July 2005. However, his stay in Manchester was short-lived as he was loaned out to Watford to gain some much-needed experience.",
      "He spent two years at Vicarage Road, making 81 appearances before returning to his parent club in summer 2007. A cruciate ligament injury sidelined him for about six months, but Foster finally made his United debut in March 2008.",
      "Sadly, he didn't play another first-team game for the rest of the season. After featuring in a total of 23 games for the club and even winning the League Cup with United twice, Foster moved to Birmingham City on a permanent deal in 2010.",
      "Since retiring from the game after a short spell with Wrexham, the 42-year-old has put plenty of effort and time into his popular podcast, Fozcast.",
      "Nemanja Vidic joined the Red Devils in January 2006 in a £7m deal from Spartak Moscow. Ferguson threw him straight into the mix, with his debut coming in a League Cup semi-final second-leg match against Blackburn.",
      "The centre-back had a rocky start, in and out of the team for his first six months, before forming a formidable partnership with Rio Ferdinand ahead of the 2006/07 season. This duo has since been hailed as one of football's most iconic pairings.",
      "Vidic played a key role in United's Champions League victory in 2008, and also bagged five Premier League titles during his tenure at the club. After making 300 appearances for the Red Devils, Vidic bid farewell to United at the end of the 2013/14 season, having netted 21 goals – an impressive tally for a central defender.",
      "After leaving United, 18 months on the books at Inter Milan followed, before he hung up his boots for good following a string of injury problems that eventually saw his contract terminated by mutual consent.",
      "Torn between Inter Milan and United, Patrice Evra eventually chose a move to England for £5.5m in January 2006. However, the French full-back initially struggled to adapt to the English game.",
      "Despite early hiccups, Evra managed to iron out his mistakes and became a vital part of the United squad, ending his first season with 14 appearances under his belt. Although he wasn't a regular starter in the 2007/08 season, he still contributed significantly to United's Premier League title win and soon became a mainstay in the team."

      "It has also been reported that Newcastle hold an interest in Tah with the Magpies looking to add more quality to their squad. Like United, their summer plans are dependent on qualifying for the Champions League, but they are in a strong position in the league.",
      "Leverkusen are set for a summer of mass change. Tah's exit is imminent and Xabi Alonso has announced that he will depart following some stunning achievements with Real Madrid seen as his most likely destination. Attacking star Florian Wirtz is of interest to Manchester City."

      "United are ready to cut their losses on the £73million former England international after discovering that the London club are now unlikely to take up the option of signing Sancho permanently following his season-long loan at Stamford Bridge. That has alerted Bundesliga pair Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund.",

And Leverkusen are now looking to add some creativity to their squad as they prepare for life without coach Xabi Alonso and playmaker Florian Wirtz.",

Ten Hag has not coached since being axed by the Red Devils in October after guiding the team to their worst start in Premier League history this season.",
      "His successor Ruben Amorim has been unable to galvanise the team since replacing the Dutchman, though he has led them to a Europa League final against Tottenham on May 21.",

The Red Devils will contest the showpiece event in Bilbao - but their employees won't be rewarded with complimentary tickets - which is in stark contrast to the decisions taken by Tottenham",
      "United will take on the north Londoners in an all-Premier League affair and they have been given an allocation of around 15,000 for the clash on May 21. The Manchester club are holding a ballot where a small number of tickets will be available for their staff. They have chosen to host a screening for the majority of staff closer to home with the invite open to plus-ones.",

Tottenham meanwhile have chosen to offer a complimentary ticket to every full-time employee should they want to travel to Bilbao - which could be up to 700 individuals.",
      "Those within Old Trafford feel that the club are prioritising supporters over staff, with tickets naturally in high demand. It is the Red Devils first European final since 2021, when they lost the Europa League final. On that occasion they had just 2,000 tickets as the world was emerging from the Covid lockdown.",
      "In the past, whilst they had significantly higher allocations, United paid for flights, accommodation and food for staff for the last three Champions League finals the club have appeared in.",
      "For the Europa League final in 2017 the club had an allocation of just 10,000.

All club employees will be able to attend the Champions League final on May 31 against Inter Milan as the French side look to conquer Europe for the first time.",

I think that is the biggest concern in our club.",

I will not talk about culture but it’s a feeling it’s the most dangerous feeling we have in a big club.",

They had not won in nearly three months. Yet United are winless in the league in two months.",

United's numbers are worth outlining in black and white for anyone prepared to cut this United squad any slack: played 36, won 10, drawn nine, lost 17 and with a -11 goal difference. United last lost 17 league games in a single season in 1973-74. Ie. the relegation season. Their goal difference was actually better under Tommy Docherty's doomed squad.",

      "Amad, starting for the first time in three months, was effectively pitted against Mohammed Kudus. That was proven to be a mismatch when the Ghanaian held off Amad to drive the ball in for Tomas Soucek, holding off Harry Amass in another mismatch, to cutely flick the ball in.",
      "Amorim fretted over Noussair Mazraoui's fitness on Thursday evening yet he stayed in the starting line-up. Mazraoui at right centre back and Amad on the right wing was possibly a trial for the Europa League final.

He was serenaded more often by the travelling Cockneys in five minutes than he was in five years at Old Trafford. He showed why he is serenaded so often with a canny reverse pass for the opening goal.",

      "Ugarte has admitted that physicality is the biggest difference between the Europa League and the Premier League. His dawdling on the ball encapsulated this United side in a microcosm. Every weekend, they live up to their 'worst-since-relegated' billing.",

      "\"So at the same time, defensively he's really solid. As I said, his individual performances have been strong in a disappointing season. He's been really good.\"",
      "Wan-Bissaka was offensively limited during his time at United, but his defensive quality in one-on-one situations was excellent and regarded among the finest in the Premier League.",
      "Wan-Bissaka left United having made 190 appearances, scoring two goals for the club."

One has said all along how unbecoming it is that they can cope in Europe but not in domestic games and this is another reminder why a clearout is absolutely essential. This squad has to look unrecognisable at the start of next season. They are 16th in the league, this will be 17 league defeats and the goal difference is currently -11.",

      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they've seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.\"",
      "Signed for £86.3m less than three years ago, it goes without saying that United paid over the odds, meaning they have no chance of recouping a fee anywhere close to what they paid.",
      "United, under profit and sustainability rules [PSR], will have to bank £32.52m to avoid a loss on him. His current form has created a market for him, meaning his stock is much higher than it was in January, but the aforementioned price tag could still put prospective suitors off.",
      "Another loan exit, this time for a full season, could be United's best chance of offloading Antony again this summer. A season-long loan deal with an option to turn it into a permanent deal at the end of it feels as though that could be the most likely type of deal to be struck.",
      "Whatever happens in the summer, Antony deserves credit for making his mark at Betis in the way he has. La Liga is not as physical as the Premier League and his performances have been much more satisfying to watch.",
      "United will have to hold their hands up and accept they misjudged Erik ten Hag's recommendation to bring him to Old Trafford, but they know they have a £32.5m target to keep in mind."

      "Former Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood is reportedly attracting interest from the Premier League ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Greenwood left United last summer to join Marseille for £26.6millon and has enjoyed a stellar first season in France. The 23-year-old has scored 19 goals in 34 appearances, with only Ousmane Dembele bettering his goal tally.",
      "After appearing to be undroppable by Roberto De Zerbi's men earlier in the season, Greenwood has been involved in a number of incidents that have sparked doubts over whether he will stay with Les Phoceens for next season.",
      "Criticism of his work rate from supporters and then attitude by De Zerbi have seen reports link him with a move away. Saudi Pro League clubs have been keen, while Barcelona have been credited with interest previously.",
      "A move to Italy or Spain are understood to be likely for Greenwood, but according to The Telegraph, those close to the striker have speculated that there is growing interest from Premier League clubs.",
      "The report adds that the former United academy graduate is 'pining' for a return to the north of England, with reports in France claiming at least two Premier League clubs are considering a move."

      "Manchester United’s midfield in the past four months has gone from one depleted of quality, energy and skill to compete to no longer being an area of concern for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Back in the final game of 2024, United were outclassed in every department by Newcastle United at Old Trafford, losing 2-0. Over 73,000 spectators witnessed a downbeat United fail to challenge Eddie Howe’s side with gapping holes in Amorim’s system continuing to hinder them.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Casemiro were United’s midfield two on the night and were levels off Sandro Tonali, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes. As a result, Casemio was an unused substitute for the next five league games and Eriksen played just 11 minutes of Premier League football before March 9.",
      "Summer signing Manuel Ugarte, who cost an initial fee of £42million, became a regular as the season unfolded and Amorim discovered a hidden gem in placing captain Bruno Fernandes slightly deeper to orchestrate play.",
      "Recently, Casemiro has enjoyed a sweet revival of his career at Old Trafford and is now viewed as undroppable. In the two Europa League semi-final victories over Athletic Bilbao, Ugarte and Casemiro have started with Fernandes playing alongside Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Mason Mount’s return to injury, and form, gives Amorim more flexibility in the attacking midfielder roles while Kobbie Mainoo has often replaced one of Ugarte or Casemiro.",
      "Now 33, relying on Casemiro to start week in, week out, should United make it to the Champions League wouldn’t be Amorim’s smartest idea since arriving. Despite his turnaround in recent weeks, new blood is needed with the Brazilian being more of a squad player.",
      "United’s priority for the summer transfer window is clearly to improve the attack for next season. But as they have fallen victim to too many times this season, games are won and lost in the middle of the park.",
      "It’s no surprise the slight increase in potential midfield targets in recent weeks. Ederson, Douglas Luiz, Fermin Lopez and Frenkie de Jong are all names mentioned but the shock link to Tonali, ironically the player who single-handedly put United’s midfield to shame in December, that could be a serious statement of intent.",
      "Reports in Italy have claimed United are ready to make a move for the former AC Milan star this summer in a deal worth €100million (£85m). Corriere dello Sport have suggested the club are set to compete with Juventus to sign the all-round midfielder, with United class as the ‘new big contender’.",
      "The signing, like the majority of business that United can do this summer, relies on them winning the Europa League and booking their spot in the Champions League. Even then, it's hard to see Newcastle even being tempted to sell the midfielder, but there is logic to the move for United.",
      "An uber fit midfielder, Tonali has played 42 games already for Newcastle this season, missing zero Premier League games since his suspension concluded at the start of the season. On the ball, he has completed 83.5% of his passes this term and off the ball, his sheer presence makes him a physical block for teams to play through the middle third.",
      "In Amorim's system, two strong, defensive midfielders are pivotal in shunning attacks and building possession for the more creative sparks in the team to create. At 25, seven years younger than Casemiro, Tonali's energy levels would take the pressure off Fernandes to assist and give him more attacking freedom."

      "Predicting how Manchester United could line up against West Ham United at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon is an almost impossible task.",
      "United will head into the clash with the Hammers still living off the thrill of booking their place in the Europa League final on Thursday evening, setting up a date with Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao later this month.",
      "United came from behind on the night to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 and progress 7-1 on aggregate, meaning they advanced without too much fuss in the end.",
      "Having moved one step closer towards achieving their primary ambition of winning the Europa League and securing Champions League qualification for next season, Amorim must navigate United's way through Sunday's clash with West Ham and next Friday night's tussle with Chelsea with the trip to the San Mames Stadium at the forefront of his mind.",
      "The Portuguese chief, who has not seen United win at home in the Premier League since February, must now strike the right balance between not pushing his players too hard and ensuring they do not lose their match sharpness ahead of the club's most important game in years.",
      "But considering the clash with West Ham will arrive less than 72 hours after the clash with Athletic, changes will be inevitable against the Londoners.",
      "For example, Amorim, less than 72 hours after the first leg against Athletic, made eight changes to his starting line-up for the 4-3 defeat to Brentford last Sunday, and it would be no great surprise to see him make a similar number of alterations this weekend.",
      "Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Alejandro Garnacho were the survivors from the team that started the first leg against Athletic, but it feels almost too risky to ask the trio to go again on Sunday.",
      "Mason Mount, who scored two brilliant goals to inspire United's third successive four-goal haul at home in the Europa League, and Amad both stepped off the bench and made telling contributions on Thursday night, meaning they will be pushing for starting berths against West Ham.",
      "Amad must start the final in the Basque Country, meaning he needs to increase his minutes to develop his match sharpness after almost three months out with an ankle problem. He has made three substitute appearances since his return at the start of this month.",
      "On the flip side, other players are in need of a breather, not least Noussair Mazraoui. The Moroccan has played in all but two games since his arrival at Old Trafford last August and Amorim admitted post-match on Thursday night that he can sense he is running low on energy.",
      "\"Nous we rest but you can feel Mazraoui does not have the energy in this moment and we will try to help in that department,\" Amorim said.",
      "With Diogo Dalot still sidelined because of a calf problem, the opportunity has never been better for Jaydan Kamason to become United's latest debutant. He has been on the bench for each of United's last four Europa League matches but was surprisingly left out of the squad against Brentford, despite Amorim confirming Mazraoui would play no part.",
      "Kamason, 18, has been one of the shining lights for United's Under-18s this season, coming on in leaps and bounds. He was a key player in their run to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals, earning plenty of plaudits for his contributions in the wins over Chelsea and Arsenal.",
      "Equally comfortable defensively and offensively, the emerging right-back has the athletic profile to do a job in Amorim's system as a wing-back.",
      "He has frequently been training with the first-team in recent weeks and his inclusion in the matchday squad for each of the last four European fixtures is a nod to the progress he has made.",
      "Kamason, who has contributed six assists for United across all youth competitions this season, is an emerging talent that United have high hopes for. Under-18s boss Adam Lawrence described him as a player with \"really big potential\" earlier this year.",
      "With United's Premier League campaign long since having petered out, Amorim can afford to take a risk or two and run the rule over the younger members of his squad ahead of next season.",
      "The Europa League final is all that matters for United between now and the end of the campaign, meaning Amorim should not be afraid to blood new faces into the team and leave opposition managers unsure what to expect.",
      "It is hardly surprising Graham Potter, on Friday, said he had \"no idea\" what to prepare for."

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane once confessed that he financially gained from the Glazer family's takeover of the club.",
      "The American ownership has been a contentious issue with supporters since their acquisition two decades ago. In his 2014 autobiography, The Second Half, Keane revealed how an astute decision to include shares in United as part of his contract led to a tidy sum following the family's purchase of the Red Devils.",
      "\"From the players' point of view, it didn't bother us too much,\" Keane, 53, wrote. \"I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me\".",
      "The Glazers are now nearing their third of ownership having acquired the shares from their £790 million buyout on May 12, 2005. They initially took over a 57 per cent stake from Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, which quickly became a 75 per cent majority just days later.",
      "Since then, their tenure has been a consistent source of frustration. Protests have been frequent and widespread dissatisfaction with their management of the club is a common concern among fans.",
      "Despite securing the Premier League title five times, the Champions League in 2008, the FA Cup twice, the League Cup six times, as well as the Europa League and FIFA World Club Cup under their leadership, fans remain concerned about the Glazers draining the club's resources.",
      "Their reign at the pinnacle of United appeared to be in coming to an end in November 2022 when they announced the club was on the market. Keane hailed the development as \"good news\", criticising the family for prioritising business over their rapport with supporters.",
      "Subsequently, Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 25 per cent share, leaving the Glazers as the predominant stakeholders but granting Ratcliffe control over football operations.",
      "Nevertheless, United's financial health has deteriorated, with revenues falling and debts rising. The club has also experienced job cuts and austerity measures since Ratcliffe's involvement.",
      "Although Keane may have profited from the initial sale, he has openly condemned the current management of United. In an October 2024 appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, he lamented the transformation of the club.",
      "\"United was always about good people and good characters, but I don't see that now. I don't recognise this team, I don't recognise the club,\" Keane said.",
      "\"They're chopping and changing and getting rid of everyone in the background which is fine, there's a business side to it, we know that. But when we're discussing Man United it's more like a business than a football club\"."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",
      "“But sometimes you can’t wait, you need a striker who can score right away. That would be my concern about Gyokeres. I would go for Isak, because he is already proven in the Premier League. He’s already posing problems and already knows how to deal with the opponents.”",

      "Last night: clean through, he chooses the fancy chip, watches it drift past the post. The same nervy feeling builds.",
      "The pundit line is that “experience will fix his decision‑making,” as if wisdom drops from the sky the day you turn twenty‑three. Decision‑making is the most instinctive of skills. You can polish it; you rarely remould it.",
      "Yes, he might leave and turn world‑class, as Scholes fears—nothing in football is impossible. But it’s hardly guaranteed. What does feel guaranteed: hand him a chance in a big game and he misses. €60 million? Please and thanks.",

It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",

The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it. I suspect Amorim’s system may reveal exactly what kind of player he is, and that he may end up being a damn good one.\nAkillies, Malawi",
      "",
      "Arsenal are not ‘elite’…\nArsenal are a club that every 20 years or so are good, at the moment they are good, but they were never an elite club with the expectation of winning. The shifting financials in football has meant being good doesn’t guarantee you anything anymore, but its usually more fun to be knocking around at the top table than not (despite the impression you get from the more delusional corners of fandom).",

PSG are in here, but really need to win something other than League 1.",
      "The third tier are clubs that were once powerful but time has moved on and they are now operating in small leagues, Ajax, Benfica and the like. A team that seeing their jersey makes you nostalgic but you know they will never be back at the top table. Forest and Villa may be dancing around the edges of this group for English football fans of a certain vintage, but they are more sparkling wine than champagne.",
      "The fourth tier is for clubs that do alright every so often, have a bit of success in their own league but don’t stir the juices. This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",

      "Paul Scholes has hit out at Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho for frequently making “wrong decisions” and outlined his “fear” over the young forward.",
      "Garnacho started the second leg of United’s Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club but was hooked on the hour mark with the Red Devils trailing 1-0 on the night, before a brilliant brace from Mason Mount and goals from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund saw them storm back and claim a 7-1 aggregate win to set up a final with Tottenham.",
      "The 20-year-old has struggled through much of this campaign as he’s struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s system, which sees him play a more central role in a 3-4-3 formation.",
      "He’s been heavily linked with an exit as a result and United are thought to be ready to listen to offers of £65m for the Argentina international, with Chelsea among those most interested in signing him.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "Fellow former United midfielder Owen Hargreaves added: “I think he’s really special and he’s a man for the big moments. He can deal with the pressure at this club.",
      "“The problem is Ruben Amorim’s system suits No. 10s but he’s better on the wings running at people, he’s probably United’s best player at that.",
      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Amad was the spark and he was denied by a smart save from Alphonse Areola, but the atmosphere soon went flat as West Ham, who were without win in eight league games themselves, took control.",
      "Mohammed Kudus was the standout player on the pitch and his drilled cross into the six-yard box was flicked in from close range by Tomas Soucek to give the visitors the lead.",
      "The problems continued to mount up for Man Utd in the second half as Leny Yoro was forced off through injury just 10 days before the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham supporters were celebrating again soon after as Manuel Ugarte was caught in possession by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Kudus then exploded into space and the ball broke for Wan-Bissaka, who decided against shooting and played the ball across goal for Bowen to tap home at the far post.",
      "Man Utd tried to find a way back into the game and their best opportunity fell to Rasmus Hojlund, but the striker was brilliantly denied from close range by Areola at full stretch as the Hammers sealed a first league win since February.",
      "The three points moves West Ham above Man Utd into 15th. Meanwhile, United, who have now suffered back-to-back league defeats at Old Trafford, are without a league win since March 16.",
      "\"If you look at the goals that we suffer, we can avoid these goals. The lack of energy, of urgency. That is the most dangerous things in this club. You can feel it at the beginning of the game. Between our box and opponent's box there is a lack of urgency. That is something we have to change in this club.",
      "\"I am responsible for that. It is frustrating because we are so near the goals. We have such a lack of urgency to protect our goal. This is week by week. We don't play so well in the Europa League but we have a different sense of urgency.",
      "\"It's something we need to work on. It's inside the pitch and outside the pitch. If we are not able to do, we have to go away and give the space to different people. All of us.",
      "\"We are going to face a team from Premier League so we are going to struggle. Of course we are going to be more focused, and that is a concern because we have to be focused every game.",
      "\"For me, it doesn't matter if we win the Europa League because the problems are much bigger than that.\"",

      "United have fallen 1-0 behind 12 times at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season, with only Leicester (15) doing so more at home in the 2024/25 competition, while it's the Red Devils' most ever in a single Premier League campaign, overtaking 11 times in 2023/24.",
      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",
      "But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in to this team in the longer-term.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two.",
      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch.",
      "You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could improve greatly next season.",
      "West Ham goalscorer Tomas Soucek:",

There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",

One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",

There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",

      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",
      "Europa League glory to end the infamous trophy drought and qualify for the Champions League, despite a potential club-record Premier League low finish, would be a successful season for Spurs.Declan Olley"

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",
      "Their run to the last four, where they were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain, earned them roughly £70m in prize money, and that is before factoring gate receipts and commercial revenues.",
      "The winner of the final between Paris-Saint Germain will earn close to £100m in prize money.",
      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",

      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",

      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",

      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",

      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Manchester United are into the final of the Europa League as a 4-1 win over Athletic Club completed a 7-1 aggregate victory.",
      "Mikel Jaureguizar's first-half goal had given Athletic hope but Mason Mount came off the bench to settle United nerves before goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund and a second from over 40 yards out by Mount earned a handsome win at Old Trafford.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",

      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",

      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 21:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
