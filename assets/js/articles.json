      "Manchester United are willing to accept cut-price offers for Ruben Amorim's outcasts – with Marcus Rashford's asking price slashed to £26million. Amorim exiled five players – Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia – from training after all declared their desire to leave.",
      "While Rashford is finalising a loan move to Barcelona for the upcoming season, the futures of the rest remain unresolved, with all four finding themselves in limbo.",
      "Rashford underwent a medical in Barcelona on Monday, ahead of a season-long loan deal, at the end of which the Spanish giants can sign him for £26m – a huge drop from his market value of £100m a few years ago. Barca will cover Rashford's wages for the loan period, with the 27-year-old - who earns £325,000-a-week at United – having accepted a 15 percent pay cut to move to the Nou Camp.",
      "United's squad fly to the US on Tuesday to begin their two-week pre-season tour and Amorim has axed all four from the travelling party, forcing them to stay behind and train.",
      "Such is United's desperation to offload those players who have been left behind, the club are willing to take a major hit on the transfer fees they could have received for them at the height of their value.",
      "Garnacho's highest market value was £70m a year ago, but his stock has fallen so low that United are willing to accept a fee of around £40m for the 20-year-old winger. It is a similar story with Sancho, signed from Borussia Dortmund for £73m in 2021, but who United are now happy to let go for £15m, just to be rid of him, although with only a year left on his contract, a loan move next season is most likely.",
      "Winger Antony joined United for £86m in 2022, but his value has also plummeted, with interested clubs now being quoted around £30m to sign him, while a fee of around £5m will be accepted for Malacia, valued at £20m a couple of years ago.",
      "In the past, United have taken on tour players who they intended to sell, most recently Sancho, who travelled to the US last summer and played, despite going on loan to Chelsea when the squad returned to the UK. Romelu Lukaku went on the 2019 tour of the Far East and Australia but did not play a minute for United, ahead of his move to Inter Milan later that summer.",
      "But the willingness of the United hierarchy to back Amorim's ruthless decision to order his exiled stars to stay behind and train, while the rest of the squad embark on a lucrative three-game tour of the States, underlines the strength of backing for the Portuguese head coach, despite last season's disastrous 15th-placed finish in the Premier League.",

      "A player dubbed Manchester United's worst-ever signing by Paul Scholes has fired back after suggesting that the midfielder's success was largely down to one of his teammates.",
      "Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was brought to Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson in 1999 as a potential successor to Peter Schmeichel. However, he faced a challenging stint at Old Trafford after an impressive seven-year spell at Aston Villa.",
      "Despite contributing to United's league triumph in his debut season, his time at the club was marred by troubles and he was replaced by Fabien Barthez. Scholes previously pinpointed Bosnich's transfer as the club's worst.",
      "Bosnich has now retaliated, insinuating that his old colleague owed much of his achievements to playing alongside Roy Keane. The 53-year-old also queried why Scholes didn't make more of an impact with England on the international stage.",
      "Speaking to former United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster on the Fozcast podcast, Bosnich said: \"Scholesy was an exceptional player but he was very fortunate, in my opinion, to play with someone like Roy Keane. Roy Keane was much underrated as a player.",
      "\"He had that hard man image, but he's a much better player than people give him credit for. I think when he [Scholes] got the right partner in midfield, he was far better. I thought he should have done a little bit more for England, really.\"",
      "Scholes didn't hold back when discussing Bosnich's poor professionalism on The Overlap podcast last September. He recalled the keeper's troubled second stint at United after first joining the club at the age of 17.",
      "Bosnich's return to the club was overshadowed by an incident involving a photographer during his stag do, which resulted in his arrest.",
      "\"I go back to the goalkeepers, when you had to try and replace Peter Schmeichel, which is always going to be difficult,\" Scholes said. \"We had a few. I was thinking [Massimo] Taibi, Mark Bosnich.",
      "\"I thought he was a good keeper at Villa, Mark Bosnich. He came to us, and he was so unprofessional. Honestly, it was ridiculous. In shooting practice, you normally have like 15, 20 shots. After three shots, he's knackered, 'Oh no, get someone else in'.",
      "\"I never realised he couldn't kick a football. I've never seen anything like it. We played Everton away, first game of the season, and none of us picked up on it. He couldn't reach the halfway line.",
      "\"There was no wind, it was a perfect day. But when you look at his feet, size 14s, honestly, he was just kicking the floor all the time. Disappointing.\"",
      "After leaving United, Bosnich became second choice at Chelsea behind Carlo Cudicini but faced a ban from football in September 2002 after a positive test for cocaine. It took him six years to return to the sport, eventually playing for Central Coast Mariners in Australia before turning to punditry.",
      "Bosnich lavished praise on United icon Ryan Giggs, naming him as his greatest ever teammate during his chat with Foster. He not only commended Giggs for his extraordinary abilities on the pitch but also highlighted his generosity off it.",
      "\"When I first met him, I was 16 or 17, and we played a game at the Cliff [training ground],\" Bosnich said. \"I remember Fergie walking up to me, and he said, 'Come and have a look at this kid at number 11.'",
      "\"It was like somebody watching Jack Nicklaus play golf for the first time or Tiger Woods and you think 'Wow'. His father was an exceptional rugby league player for St Helens so he had that wonderful balance and running. As soon as he turned up at 15 or 16, everyone's going, 'Play him, play him'.",
      "\"For me, he was an outstanding lad. If you rang him up at three in the morning and said, 'I've got a problem and I need your help,' no matter what it was, he was there for you.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "And former United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes Gallagher would be an excellent addition. \"Man Utd don't need a bit more bite, they need legs, real legs, real closing down,\" Strachan told OLBG.",
      "\"Can Conor Gallagher do that? Yes he can, he's definitely got legs, he's a good teammate. Has he got enough imagination? I don't know, but if you have people like that with legs in there and have imagination around them, then he'd be a good signing.",
      "\"The days of the luxury player, if you want to be a top side, are gone. So, Conor Gallagher has definitely got the legs. He's got the robustness. Has he got goals?",
      "\"Has he got that flair? These players are hard to come by. Would I take him compared to some of the players that have played over the last couple of years at Man Utd? Yes, I would.\"",
      "Gallagher came though Chelsea's academy and left the club in 2024, joining Atletico Madrid in a £34million deal. The midfielder enjoyed an impressive first season in Spain, where he was one of three non-EU players alongside Samuel Lino and Nahuel Molina.",
      "Spanish clubs are only allowed to have three players without EU citizenship in their squad and Thiago Almada's move from Botafogo this summer means they now have four. As a result, Spanish outlet COPE are reporting that one of Gallagher, Lino and Molina will depart.",

Barcelona won a domestic treble last season, lifting the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.",
      "And Barcelona's success came after Flick implemented 10 strict rules that he expects every member of his squad to follow, according to Spanish publication AS. The report states that Flick has demanded that each player arrives for training at least 90 minutes early, with the German often the first person at the training ground.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has revealed that an incredible \"buzz\" swept through Old Trafford when Cristiano Ronaldo made his sensational return in the summer of 2021. Carrick was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching team when the Portuguese superstar rejoined the Red Devils.",
      "He has now acknowledged that the signing lifted the entire club, yet confessed he handled the global icon, who left in acrimonious circumstances in November 2022, \"differently\" compared to other players under his guidance.",
      "Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Carrick described the surreal experience of witnessing the legendary Ronaldo back at United's Carrington training ground, more than a decade after his departure to Real Madrid in 2009.",
      "\"Yeah, he was good,\" Carrick said when Ferdinand quizzed him about Ronaldo's comeback. \"I mean, there was a hell of a buzz around the place when he came back. It was an incredible kind of feeling around those games, and then him coming back. And just seeing him back around the building was weird.\"",
      "The former midfielder explained how coaching Ronaldo presented a completely different challenge, saying: \"So there's definitely then for me, from a coaching point of view, I was really conscious of then treating him very different to when I would treat some of the younger players or the ones that are really intense, trying to help a lot and trying to develop them.",
      "\"He's at the end where he is what he is, you know, and you respect what he is. And we give a few kinds of pointers for the team. You're not going to coach him.",
      "\"There's no way I'm coaching him about his runs or where to finish. But it's a totally different element of coaching to say what I was coaching with some of the other boys, where you're trying to really give them some help and advice and improve them a lot. It's just incredible what he's done.\"",
      "Initially joining United in August 2023, Ronaldo went on to cement his status as one of the game's most exceptional talents at Old Trafford.",
      "He netted more than a century of goals for the Red Devils and contributed to United securing three Premier League crowns plus the Champions League, with Carrick revealing his astonishment at Ronaldo's progression during their time as teammates.",
      "\"I mean, for me, that first year when I signed, he didn't score as many goals, but it was 2006, 2007, and he played right wing. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable. And then he got a taste of scoring goals after that. And then he changed a bit.",
      "\"He scored 40-odd goals the next year. But honestly, that first season after he came back from the World Cup with him in Wazza [Wayne Rooney] when he was on that right wing as an all-round player, I've never seen... I don't think I've seen that before.\"",
      "Ronaldo's return spell, despite delivering some spectacular moments, proved disappointing for both player and club. He left United in November 2022 following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, during which he criticised the club's condition and his handling under former United manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Yet Carrick has praised the now 40-year-old Al-Nassr star for the boost he brought and his committed attitude to fitness and preparation.",
      "\"I think it was a genuine buzz,\" Carrick said. \"But when he came back, I think everyone was buzzing to see what he was going to bring. And he had to manage himself a little bit more. He was smarter then in terms of his body and training-wise and how much he needed to push himself.",
      "\"He still scored goals. And I'm sure the boys learnt off him by just something to the times like we learnt at the time of other players. You learn by watching a lot of the time. And they don't always have to tell you things. It's more of the experience of being around him.\"",
      "Finally, when questioned if Ronaldo's apparent reluctance to track back and assist with defensive duties was ever a problem, Carrick sought to set the record straight.",
      "\"No, listen, there's obviously parts of it where it's not always an individual thing,\" he added. \"You're trying to put the team together and you've got things that you're trying to work on. But he scored goals. He was always going to score. He always has. He's continuing to do it. You know, it's what he does.\"",

And recent reports have indicated that the Argentina international would love to make such a move, though Villa are in a position of strength given he signed a new five-year contract last year.",

      "Yet Fernandes elected to stay at United, and the Portuguese star's defiance and self-belief are the very characteristics that Carrick believes helps make Fernandes United's \"talisman\".",
      "Carrick joined United's coaching staff after retiring from the game in 2018. He also took up the brief role as United's caretaker manager on two separate occasions - in December 2018 after Jose Mourinho was sacked and in November 2021 following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - and so has first-hand experience of dealing with United's star man.",
      "Appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Carrick detailed his thoughts on Fernandes, 30, and he only had positive things to say about the Portuguese. \"Yeah, I like Bruno. I work with him, with Ole [Gunnar Solskjar] and he's fantastic,\" he told Ferdinand.",
      "\"He's got a real, he's desperate to do well. He's so keen to do well, and that's a really positive thing. And then sometimes, you can overdo it sometimes as well, and it's such a fine balance. But his attitude, he plays every game, he never misses training, and he's there all the time.",
      "\"Puts himself out there, puts himself forward, and he's been the main man, really, the talisman for some time. And when there's moments or there's something that's needed, Bruno's been the one to step up. I really enjoyed working with him when I did. He asks questions, he's demanding, but he wants to do the right thing.\"",
      "Asked by Ferdinand about how he communicated his ideas to Fernandes while he was caretaker manager, Carrick added: \"He took it pretty quickly. He got it, he understood what it was. It's amazing you get a feel for that with certain players. You would have had it when we were playing, some players come and grasp it and get it.",
      "\"I understand the whole thing, because I think there's a responsibility in United that it's not just that little bit of football on the pitch. There's a whole other world out there, isn't there? There's a responsibility, really, I think, in terms of behaviour and how you act and how you do things. And that was certainly from when I came through the door, that was almost thrown upon you.",
      "\"You had no choice, but you made a deal with it. You don't, and if you don't, then see you later. And Bruno's the type that he embraced all that straight away.\"",
      "On whether Fernandes, who has 98 goals in 290 appearances for United since joining in 2020, would fit into Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary squads over the years, Carrick said: \"Ability-wise, definitely, I think. But also, he'd buy into what we were trying to achieve.\"",
      "Fernandes publicly addressed a potential move away from United earlier this summer. Speaking at a press conference for his national team in June he said: \"There was an opportunity. The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there. They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach [Ruben] Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "\"Manchester United didn’t want to sell me. They don’t need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.\"",

      "The forward, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, is set to join the Spanish giants for the season. He is not part of Ruben Amorim's plans and a move away was always on the cards this summer with Rashford set to benefit.",
      "The 27-year-old arrived in Barcelona on Sunday night after getting permission from United to complete his loan switch. A deal was agreed in principle over the weekend, which will see him move to the La Liga champion for a year before they have the option to buy.",
      "Rashford scored the first goal of the Amorim-era but quickly fell out of favour. The head coach publicly called out some of the player's habits and he's since seen his No 10 taken away given to new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Pogba, who played with Rashford for six years, hopes that he goes on to be a major success at Barcelona, where he will complement the likes of Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Pogba during a YouTube live stream with IShowSpeed: \"That's crazy. I'm happy for him because they took his number out.\" He went on to add: \"Manchester United, they're losing a great player.",

He needs to win at the end, you know, if he doesn't play well, he doesn't win, they're gonna sack him. But, like, I'm happy for Marcus.\"",
      "Back in 2021, when Pogba was still on the books in Manchester, the Frenchman claimed that his compatriot Kylian Mbappe and Rashford were \"the present and the future of football\" after excelling as showcasing their potential across a number of years.",
      "The United academy graduate has previously excelled in Manchester, scoring 30 times during Erik ten Hag's first season in 2022/23. His numbers have since dropped off, but he was able to rediscover some of his best form whilst at Villa Park last term. Rashford has been holding out for a move to Barcelona despite Premier League clubs also expressing an interest in him."

      "Rio Ferdinand is adamant Manchester United stood their ground and didn't 'buckle' when it came to the transfer of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The former United defender feels that the hierarchy at Old Trafford ultimately refused to budge on the number they had in mind for Mbeumo, and this is the reason why the transfer discussions went on for so long. The Cameroon international looks set to join the Red Devils after a bid worth up to £71million was accepted by Brentford over the weekend.",
      "United previously had two bids rejected by the Premier League side for the 25-year-old, which Ferdinand believes was the club playing the long game in order to get their man for the right price.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel Rio Presents, the 46-year-old said: \"I think the Mbeumo deal, I think Man United in past years would have buckled and just given Brentford exactly what they wanted.",
      "\"I think this one they didn't. I think they stood firm and said, 'Listen, we're not going to move. We've got other targets and we'll go to them, we're willing to wait but we're not going to budge on the number.'\"",
      "Discussing United's transfer strategy of old, Ferdinand added: \"I think before, the old regime would have buckled and just said, 'We'll give you what you want and paid over the odds,' like we have with numerous players over the years.",
      "\"So I think yes, it did take longer than we thought or expected or anticipated, but it got done and I think it was nearer to the price that Man United wanted to pay rather than what Brentford were trying to ask for and demand. So in that sense I'd say that's good.\"",
      "The Premier League icon is one of very few who believes United's transfer plans for Mbeumo were the correct way to go, as the move took over six weeks to complete.",
      "This lengthy saga frustrated many supporters as the player snubbed interest from the likes of Arsenal, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur to focus solely on a move to Manchester.",
      "Even Mbeumo's new team-mates were quick to comment on the time it took for him to join, as Leny Yoro offered an insight to the dressing room's reaction to the signing. Speaking after United's 0-0 draw against Leeds United in their pre-season friendly on Saturday, the French defender was full of praise for the club's next signing.",
      "\"Bryan is a really good player, I am really happy he has come to the club,\" Yoro told United's Scandinavian Supporters' Club.",

      "Jose Mourinho has said that he is ready to return to management in his native Portugal. The ex-Manchester United boss even hinted that he was eyeing a role with the national team once again, with a potentially awkward reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo on the cards should he make the jump to international coaching.",
      "Mourinho, 62, is currently at the helm of Turkish giants Fenerbahce after taking over in June 2024. However, after leading his side to a 2-1 victory over Portuguese second division side Portimonense in a pre-season friendly last week, Mourinho dropped the bombshell that he is ready to make a return to the country where it all began for him.",
      "Mourinho has not coached in Portugal since 2004, where he had spells with with Benfica and Porto. \"I will come back to Portugal for sure. It hasn't happened yet, but it will happen,\" Mourinho told Sport TV last week.",
      "\"Not because I feel close to the end, I feel far from that. I don't want to come to Portugal for a golden retirement or for my final years in my career.\"",
      "He continued: \"I want to come to Portugal at the peak of my career, in good health and in top physical and mental shape. I will definitely return. Club or national team? Either, but not Portimonense, because they already have a good manager (laughs).\"",
      "Rumours of discord between Mourinho, who was sacked by United in 2018, and Ronaldo were rife when the legendary coach managed the five-time Ballon d'Or winner at Real Madrid for three seasons. If Mourinho decides to take over the reins of his country it could have wider implications with Ronaldo still very much a focal point for the team, currently managed by Roberto Martinez.",
      "Mourinho and Ronaldo's relationship was fraught in the Spanish capital, with the Portuguese tactician often slamming his star player for what he perceived was a lack of tactical discipline. According to Guillem Balague's book, Cristiano Ronaldo: The Biography, Mourinho once engaged Ronaldo in a huge row after the forward took a throw-in too quickly.",
      "\"After everything I've done for you, this is how you treat me? How dare you say that to me\", Mourinho reportedly bellowed at Ronaldo. \"I was saying it for the team because the team needed you to track back.\"",
      "Tensions worsened as Mourinho supposedly added: \"Just so you know, many think like me here, but don't dare say it, they don't have the balls to tell you.\" It is then believed the pair had to be separated.",
      "Despite their difficulties, time heals all wounds and it seems that applies to the iconic compatriots. Speaking later on, and perhaps offering an insight into how he would coach a 40-year-old Ronaldo for the national team, Mourinho said: \"I think you don't coach [him].",
      "\"Motivation, you don't need to give him. Ambition, you don't need to give him. Technique, you don't need to give him. You give some tactical adjustments and let the guy be happy.\"",
      "The two-time Champions League-winning boss was also happy to brand Ronaldo as one of \"the best players of all time\" and insisted that coaching him was \"the highlight\" of his career. He also moved to distinguish any bad blood too, saying: \"A coach and a player may have their differences at a given time, but it ends there.\"",
      "Since leaving Porto in 2004, Mourinho has managed Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham and Roma. Ronaldo, clearly impressed by his old bosses' CV, has claimed that he would be open to working with Mourinho again.",
      "Sensationally, Al-Nassr star Ronaldo even lauded Mourinho as the best coach he has ever worked with – even above Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I would put him at the top, I always say that,\" Ronaldo said.",
      "A dream reunification in the offing or just two of the game's biggest egos on a collision course once again? Only time will tell as all eyes will firmly be on Mourinho's next move."

      "Manchester United are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo after weeks of talks with Brentford, but the Red Devils are not expected to stop there in the transfer market.",
      "Pending a medical and final details, Mbeumo will join Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon through the door at Old Trafford as United's third summer signing. The 25-year-old attacker will join for a financial package which could reach £71million if all add-ons are met, with United paying a base fee of £65m across four instalments.",

      "The England international will join Barca on a temporary basis before a £26million option to buy becomes active next summer. Just before 9pm on Sunday, Rashford's private jet landed in Barcelona.",

Celebrities have also flown in from around the world to watch Oasis perform 16 years after the brothers' explosive split which contributed to a packed Manchester terminal.",
      "A source said: \"Marcus' travel plans were disrupted so it was all a bit stressful but he would have walked to Barcelona to sign for them. Noel and Liam can have a laugh that they accidentally put a spanner in the works.\"",
      "Upon finally landing in Barcelona, Rashford was filmed getting into a car taking him to a hotel, where he'll sleep before having a medical on Monday. The 27-year-old didn't offer any words, but he gave a smile and a thumbs-up to journalists and supporters who were welcoming him.",
      "Rashford identified Barca as his dream move after being told that he had no future under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.

      "Manchester United have reportedly held talks with Nicolas Jackson’s agent to explore the possibility of a transfer for the Chelsea striker. United are trying to overhaul their squad in the summer transfer window and want to sign a striker for Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves and are close to announcing the £70m capture of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Mbeumo underwent his medical on Sunday and should be signed in time to join United on their pre-season tour of the United States – but the club aren’t done yet in the transfer window.",
      "They have tried to hijack Viktor Gyokeres’ move from Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal with a last-gasp bid. United have tabled an offer worth between €70-80million (£60-69m), according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Amorim wants a centre-forward to provide competition for Rasmus Hojlund, who managed just 10 goals in 52 games across all competitions last season. And United are scouring the market for opportunities, with BBC Sport reporting that a meeting has taken place with Jackson’s agent Ali Barat.",
      "Jackson suddenly finds himself in a difficult position at Chelsea, who have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro this summer. Both made positive impressions during the Blues’ successful Club World Cup campaign and Jackson is considering his options.",
      "Recent reports have suggested that Chelsea are not particularly keen to sell the Senegal international. They have slapped a £100m price tag on the 24-year-old, who was Enzo Maresca’s primary centre-forward as they finished fourth and won the Conference League in 2024/25.",
      "In true Chelsea fashion, Jackson is under contract until June 2033, having signed for £32m from Villarreal in 2023. He has 30 goals and 12 assists in 81 matches for the club, but has often been viewed as inconsistent in front of goal, despite having a good connection with playmaker Cole Palmer.",
      "AC Milan and Aston Villa have also been linked with Jackson and Football London reports that he would be sold if the right offer came along. That is partly because they have spent £85m in total on Delap and Pedro and partly because of their impact in the US. There is also the problem of Jackson’s recent disciplinary record: he has been sent off twice in his last five games.",
      "United’s interest in Jackson is interesting because Chelsea have been linked with a move for Alejandro Garnacho this summer. Garnacho is part of the so-called ‘bomb squad’ at United, which also included Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Amorim has isolated the five players as they seek moves elsewhere and Garnacho is the most valuable of the group. While Rashford is leaving for Barcelona on loan and Sancho is heading for Juventus, rumours surrounding Garnacho have grown quiet.",
      "The Argentina winger was originally linked with Napoli, but they were put off by United’s £70m asking price. However, Chelsea have just sold Noni Madueke for £52m to Arsenal and are in the market for a winger, having opted not to sign Sancho following his loan spell.",

      "Back in January, the word from Barcelona was that the club’s sporting director, Deco, was “not that fussed” about Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford ended up playing in a different shade of claret and blue at Aston Villa, underwhelmed and has now ended up at Barcelona.",
      "It is a move that does not make much sense yet also makes sense. Barcelona have a deluxe back-up to a front three of Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski. Manchester United have found a club prepared to cover Rashford’s £325,000-a-week salary. It was always going to be a loan with an option to buy.",
      "Barca have admired Rashford for several years yet are signing him at one of his lowest ebbs. Villa declined the chance to buy him for £40million, Rashford had his squad number revoked and was ordered to report at United’s Carrington training complex after the first team had left this month.",
      "An agency source said Rashford has “done extremely well” to get Barcelona. The Spanish agent, Arturo Canales, helped broker Rashford’s loan to Villa in February and was re-hired to specifically secure a move to Barcelona.",
      "United have done extremely well to get Rashford off the books before August. Liverpool merit a mention. They resisted selling Luis Diaz to Barca after their prime target, Inaki Williams, signed a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Rashford is Barca’s plan C and, on paper, a substitute for La Liga's champions. He has broken double figures in only one of the past four seasons for United.",
      "High-ranking figures at United expected him to move abroad. Rashford mischievously refused to discount crossing the divide to Manchester City or heading down the East Lancs Road to Liverpool. There was no concrete evidence either of United’s rivals were interested in him.",
      "It is in United’s interests that Rashford performs in Spain. It would make him more sellable next year, when he will have entered the final two years of his United contract. While Ruben Amorim is in situ, there is no chance of United reintegrating Rashford back into their first team squad.",
      "Rashford has put in the hours over the summer. His Instagram account, almost certainly run by his brother and former agent, Dwaine, has charted a rigorous training schedule of gym-work and ball-work. Rashford spent four hours in a Salford gym last Monday.",
      "Hangers-on weighed Rashford down in recent years but his entourage on holiday in Cannes were on the grass with him. He was joined by brothers Dwaine, Dane, cousin Lois and former United academy teammate Roshaun Williams.",
      "Rashford shone at Camp Nou in United's engrossing 2-2 Europa League knockout draw in February 2023, scoring their equaliser and single-handedly forcing Jules Kounde's own goal. He was at his zenith that season, with the caveat that Rashford's form came with his camp in the midst of contract negotiations.",
      "Have a glance at Rashford's goals tallies over the past four seasons: five, 30, eight and seven. You can pinpoint the one that preceded a lucrative salary hike.",
      "Despite that 30-goal season, privately he bristled at some of Erik ten Hag's methods and how dogmatic the Dutchman could be. Their working relationship disintegrated during Ten Hag's final year at United.",
      "Rashford was irritated to start the 2023-24 season up front while Rasmus Hojlund recovered from a stress fracture of the back. At Villa, Unai Emery regularly played Rashford through the middle. Lewandowski, 37, is not showing many signs of slowing down but he is out of contract at Barcelona next year.",
      "After Amorim discounted Rashford from selection, the player exercised some moderate PR, attending a game in his hospitality box at Old Trafford. There was polite applause from the Stretford End on his final squad appearance when he warmed up against Newcastle in December.",
      "Figures at United are continuing to tread on eggshells with Rashford, still keen to highlight his legacy as one of their most striking academy graduates. Rashford has long since abandoned diplomacy, thanking Alejandro Garnacho for his puerile post in a Villa 'Rashford 9' shirt last month.",
      "One down, three to go for United. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Garnacho will, by hook or by crook, be gone by 7pm on September 1. United will then have a leaner, fresher and more harmonious forward line. One that has to be sharpened by a new striker.",
      "They need to be fussed about that."

United were scheduled to fly to Shanghai in less than a week and Mourinho was impatiently awaiting Henrikh Mkhitaryan's arrival. Mkhitaryan was in Manchester the following day and on the plane to China.",
      "Supporters are not the only ones who revel in the fillip of a new addition in time for a pre-season tour. In 2015, Matteo Darmian, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin all signed over the weekend before United departed for Seattle and images of the newbies were predictably lapped up.",
      "Romelu Lukaku was already in Los Angeles, holidaying with Paul Pogba, when United flew there for their buoyant 2017 tour. United had agreed a club record fee for Lukaku (rising to £90m) and had blindsided Chelsea to sign him from Everton. Such a move, after a Europa League triumph in May, maintained the feel-good factor.",
      "That was in stark contrast to Mourinho's fraught final tour in 2018, overshadowed by briefing and counter-briefing. After congratulating his daughter, Matilde, on her graduation, Mourinho's first words at his opening press conference at the UCLA were \"our pre-season is very bad\".",
      "He publicly demanded two more signings and never got them. Ed Woodward dodged Mourinho across four different states and was eventually spotted hurriedly catching up with him in the bowels of the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Woodward looked like he was caught between a rock and a hard place.",
      "One of the senior United players in Los Angeles was hesitant about a media activity due to the manager's \"bad mood\". It did not improve in Phoenix, Ann Arbor or Florida and Woodward questioned a prospective employee on how to deal with Mourinho's outbursts.",
      "Woodward never truly recovered from his first summer as executive vice-chairman in 2013. He breezily briefed that he had left the tour in Australia on \"urgent transfer business\". Cesc Fabregas was leading him down the garden path.",
      "The high point of David Moyes's reign came at the start when he got his hands on the Community Shield. His mood afterwards was tetchy as reporters grilled him on the Fabregas collapse. Moyes accused some of writing \"untruths\". Moyes was already unravelling after an exhausting pre-season in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong.",
      "2018 was the last tour where a United manager did not agree to the traditional sit-down with the travelling British journalists. Mourinho felt he was lacking allies and he derided a member of the communications department's suggestion on how to counter the criticism.",
      "Ruben Amorim's tan suggests he has enjoyed plenty of sun during his downtime and his demeanour should be sunnier than his compatriot's seven years ago. United players are already buoyed by the breakthrough for Bryan Mbeumo, likely to be unveiled before they touch down in Chicago on Tuesday.",
      "Having Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha on the plane and, hopefully, on the MetLife pitch against West Ham United next Saturday will change the perception of a team that has recorded a minus goal difference in successive seasons.",
      "Amorim did not speak to the travelling journalists in Stockholm on Saturday but is scheduled to address the press in Chicago on Friday. The line of questioning will not be as intense with two £130m forwards added to a blunt attack.",
      "United are close to a settled XI: Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt were among the first recruits of the Ineos era, Harry Maguire had his contract extended in the New Year, Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte arrived within the last 12 months, Bruno Fernandes committed through a new contract last year and the rejection of the Saudi Pro League this, while Amad was also tied down on new terms.",
      "The issues are at the back and up front. United have prioritised their attack over the goalkeeper and the timing of Andre Onana's injury could work in his favour ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "The more pressing matter is the striker. With Joshua Zirkzee back in Manchester nursing a minor injury, Rasmus Hojlund did not even start against Leeds United. Amorim picked a rotational XI that was demonstrably not the strongest available to him, with two auxiliary centre backs in the back three and rookie Diego Leon in from the start.",
      "Yet there was possibly something to read into Chido Obi's inclusion. His performance and goals in the post-season tour win in Hong Kong did him no harm. Hojlund's form that night was identical to his competitive outings and he does not have the confidence of the United manager or supporters.",
      "But Obi cannot lead the line for United in four weeks' time. By the time Arsenal's coach pulls into Old Trafford, United best have made that third player official."

      "With United now on the cusp of adding Mbeumo to head coach Ruben Amorim's squad, MEN Sport has looked at three ways the Cameroonian could slot into the Portuguese chief's plans on the tour.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals in 2024/25, nobody would question Amorim deploying Mbeumo in the front three. The 25-year-old was one of the Premier League's best players last season and was directly involved in 27 goals.",
      "He predominantly played as a right-winger, cutting inside onto his trusty left foot. United will be hoping he can flex his muscles in a similar way at Old Trafford, albeit in a different formation.",
      "Mbeumo is a versatile operator, meaning he should comfortably be able to adapt to Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and operate as the right-sided No.10. Matheus Cunha is a shoo-in for the left-sided No.10 berth, meaning he and Mbeumo can become United's chief playmakers and support the central striker.",
      "With Amorim constantly demanding his wing-backs to get up the pitch and support the attackers, they are essentially wingers. The onus is on them to provide width and create chances.",
      "Mbeumo has built his career as a winger and would be effective on the right in Amorim's system. The former Troyes man is set to be in direct competition with Amad for either the No.10 spot or right wing-back berth, creating a healthy rivalry.",
      "United's right flank has been a weak spot for a number of years and Mbeumo has the quality and capacity to finally fix it. Patrick Dorgu is more defensive minded, and the Dane starting on the left would give United a sense of balance if Mbeumo starts on the right.",
      "Despite signing Cunha and being on the cusp of landing Mbeumo, United still have ambitions to sign an out-and-out No.9 this summer. Signing a striker was their top priority at the start of the window and that remains the case.",
      "However, after missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, United are yet to settle on an alternative, and it could be a case of them having to bide their time in their search for a reliable goalscorer. United have often landed their top target late in the window in recent years.",
      "In the absence of the addition of a new No.9, Rasmus Hojlund is in pole position to remain top of the pecking order for the pre-season tour. Chido Obi is expected to provide competition.",
      "However, Mbeumo is capable of leading the line as a makeshift centre-forward. It should not be his natural role at United, but he was tasked with playing through the middle on a handful of occasions last season and did not look out of place.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Aston Villa have reportedly become the latest club to express interest in United's Garnacho. The Reds previously valued Garnacho at £70million, but that figure may be hard to achieve given the public fallout over the winger's situation at United.

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has admitted he rejected offers to return to England following his departure from Old Trafford in July 2023.",
      "After 12 years at United, the Reds made the decision not to renew his contract following the conclusion of the 2022/23 campaign, despite originally planning to extend De Gea's stay.",
      "De Gea made a cluster of errors towards the end of that campaign and United opted to release him. Despite being able to offer a wealth of experience, De Gea was without a club for more than a year, eventually being snapped up by Fiorentina in August 2024. He made 42 appearances in his first season in Italy, keeping 11 clean sheets.",
      "The Spaniard has now revealed he had opportunities to return to England prior to moving to Fiorentina, but has admitted it would have been \"impossible\" for him to play anywhere but United.",
      "\"I turned down offers from England because after spending so many years at a club like United, you feel like you don't want to play for another club in England,\" De Gea told Cronache.",
      "\"I only wanted Manchester United, and while it's true that I received offers from England, I knew it would be impossible for me to play anywhere else. I've spent my whole life there; it's the club that shaped me and allowed me to have a wonderful career.",
      "\"I felt it was time to rest and come back even stronger.\"",
      "De Gea, who could return to Old Trafford next month when United face Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly, teamed up with goalkeeping coach Craig Ellison during his time out of the game and they soon clicked.",
      "He added: \"I lived between Madrid and Manchester. When I felt like I wanted to get back into coaching to get back into shape, I started looking for a goalkeeping coach to help me.",
      "\"They recommended Craig Ellison, and from the first training session, our relationship immediately took shape. There was a wonderful connection, he's a phenomenon both as a person and as a coach, I love him dearly.",
      "\"A friendship was born. He helped me during that break: I trained a lot and we spent a lot of time together. Lots of chats with an exceptional guy.",
      "\"During this year off, which was special for me given that I'd been playing at a high level for 15 years, I trained at the Spanish national team's federal training centre and on a fifth division pitch in England. I think this year off did me great mentally and physically.\"",

      "Amorim's focus will be on setting his squad up for the next season, but for many, including Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada, the priority is on finalising certain deals and laying the groundwork for others.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is the priority and the move to finally bring the Brentford star to Old Trafford is expected to be completed in time for the 25-year-old to travel to Chicago on Tuesday. United reached an agreement on Friday to sign the forward in a deal worth up to £70million.",
      "The deal will take United's spending past the £120m mark and with a new striker and goalkeeper remaining on their radar this summer, it's highly likely that players will have to be sold to raise funds.",
      "After failing in their pursuits for Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike, United are back at square one in their hunt for a new centre-forward. It has left alternatives receiving mixed receptions with Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Moise Kean all linked.",
      "RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is reportedly on their radar and after Arsenal opted to move for Gyokeres, Sesko remains available. It's unclear how quickly a deal could be done but Amorim will want to have a new striker in, should he get one, sooner rather than later.",
      "Andre Onana's injury means Amorim is short in the goalkeeper department. It's been reported that Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens is of interest with the Belgian side wanting just £17m, around the same that United are saving on Rashford's salary this season.",

      "Former manager Erik ten Hag's first summer at Old Trafford will always be remembered by most for United's unsuccessful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong.",
      "The Barcelona ace was identified as Ten Hag's top target to try and fix United's long-term midfield problem. They had worked together at Ajax prior to De Jong moving to Spain in 2019.",
      "After more than three months of back and forth conversations between United and Barcelona, the Reds were eventually forced to move on. Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid just over a week after the infamous 4-0 battering at Brentford.",
      "During that period United pressed ahead with other matters, recruiting Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Christian Eriksen. They also explored the prospect of trying to bring in a striker.",
      "Unfortunately, they ended the window without bringing in a new forward, meaning Wout Weghorst arrived on loan from Burnley.",
      "Nevertheless, United explored the option of signing then-Red Bull Salzburg striker Benjamin Sesko in July 2022. Former United football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer.",
      "United's interest in Sesko never translated into a formal bid and it was announced in early-August the Slovenian international had agreed to join Salzburg's sister club, RB Leipzig, on a five-year deal, coming into effect from July 2023.",
      "Sesko scored 18 goals in 41 games in his final season in Austria and officially joined Leipzig ahead of the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The 22-year-old picked up where he left off, scoring 18 goals in his debut season at Leipzig. His 14 Bundesliga goals helped them finish fourth in the table and he also chipped in with two goals in the Champions League.",
      "Sesko, who will be hoping to help Slovenia qualify for next year's World Cup, surpassed his tally of 18 goals in 2023/24 last term, scoring 21 times across all competitions. He scored 13 times in the Bundesliga and plundered four goals apiece in the Champions League and the DFB-Pokal.",
      "After just two seasons in Germany, Sesko, who is under contract at the Red Bull Arena until 2029, has a respectable 39 goals in 87 matches. He has also registered eight assists.",
      "In comparison to Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, who have both been linked with United in recent weeks and months, Sesko's record is not as fruitful. However, he only turned 22 at the end of May.",
      "His record of 68 goals in the last four seasons has elevated his profile. He is widely considered as one of the best up-and-coming strikers in Europe and he continues to be linked with some of Europe's elite clubs.",
      "United have once again been linked with him over the last few days amid their need for a striker this summer. After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United have been forced to explore alternative avenues this summer.",
      "The Reds are desperate to recruit an out-and-out centre-forward after finishing the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference. Matheus Cunha and the impending addition of Bryan Mbeumo will considerably strengthen United's attack, but they are still missing a key piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Reports elsewhere have suggested Leipzig may entertain offers around the £70million mark for Sesko. That reported valuation will account for his record in Germany and his potential.",
      "The Slovenian is on the cusp of breaking into the category of elite-level strikers. He has been bracketed alongside the likes of Hugo Ekitike, Osimhen and Gyokeres this summer, each of who are set to be on the move.",
      "Truthfully, United would be taking less of a risk by signing a striker more established than Sesko. But after being prepared to take a punt on Delap after just one season as a Premier League regular, there would be logic in trying for Sesko.",

      "The Spanish heavyweights have agreed terms for a loan deal with an option to make it permanent, and Rashford could prove to be a valuable asset for a team that flourished in Flick's debut season. Barcelona clinched a domestic treble last term, securing the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.",
      "Barcelona's triumphant campaign reportedly followed the introduction of 10 strict rules by Flick, which every squad member is expected to abide by, as reported by Spanish outlet AS. The report suggests that Flick insists on players arriving for training at least 90 minutes early, often being the first one at the training ground himself.",
      "A daily weigh-in is also said to be part of the routine to monitor the squad's fitness levels, while all players are required to eat meals prepared by club nutritionist Silvia Tremoleda at the Ciutat Esportiva canteen.",
      "Additionally, players must participate in a warm-up session on match days, a practice that was reportedly abandoned under former manager Xavi following objections from the squad, reports the Mirror.",
      "Flick also insists that his squad gather at the team hotel before every match, with the 60-year-old reportedly eager to 'oversee every aspect and prevent any unwelcome surprises'. He has additionally eliminated late-night flights following away fixtures to enhance player recuperation.",
      "However, training under Flick proves extremely demanding, with Barcelona conducting lengthy and rigorous sessions that stretch to approximately 90 minutes. He has also abolished the penalty system that existed under Xavi, placing faith in his players to maintain their own standards.",

      "Everyone in Stockholm knew that Manchester United were in town over the weekend.",
      "The receptionist at one hotel said they were fully booked because of the pre-season friendly against Leeds on Saturday afternoon, and accommodation prices had rocketed.",
      "United shirts were dotted around Sweden's capital and the 50,000-capacity Strawberry Arena was sold out for the match. And while Leeds fans had a presence at the game, the majority of the crowd came to see United.",
      "On the eve of the pre-season opener, local supporters congregated at O'Leary's - a sports bar in the centre of Stockholm - for an event organised by Manchester Supporters Club Scandinavia.",
      "Members of different supporter branches across Scandinavia were present for a night of entertainment, which included a United quiz, music from Ryan Jarvis, a live podcast, and a question-and-answer session with former United players Jesper Blomqvist and Ronny Johnsen, who also signed autographs.",
      "Many fans travelled from Norway and there was a healthy split between Swedish and Norwegian supporters in the bar, along with a handful of Mancunians.",
      "United colours decorated each corner of the room and even the staff behind the bar wore United shirts. One employee wore a Jesse Lingard shirt and another had David Beckham's name on the back.",
      "Blomqvist and Johnsen were generous with their time after the Q&A, taking photos with fans and taking time to chat.",
      "The pair are idolised by fans in Scandinavia for what they achieved at Old Trafford. They were art of the treble-winning dressing room in '99 and never have to buy a beer when they are in Scandi territory.",
      "\"I first started supporting United after getting a Christmas gift from my grandparents,\" Sorkie said. \"It was a Manchester United scarf and my brother got Derby County. And that's when we started looking up the games on Norwegian television on a Saturday, because it was only one game shown on the Saturday.",
      "\"Every time it was Manchester United, I was always watching that. Since then, it has been my team. I was not one of the founders of the supporters' club, but it started in 1981. I became a member in '83 and have been a member ever since.\"",
      "Sorkie was proud to have Blomqvist and Johnsen involved. \"It's really cool,\" he said. \"The really fun thing is Jesper is Swedish, Ronny is Norwegian and there is a lot of Norwegian and Swedish people at this event, it's not just Swedish.",
      "\"I think we've been able to give people from both sides of the world, people from the Swedish and Norwegian community, a great experience, combining them tonight.\"",
      "Sorkie continued: \"It's really nice to have United back in Sweden. It shows there is a lot of people cheering for Manchester United in Sweden. We have sold over 6,000 tickets for the game tomorrow, and most people [fans at the game] will be supporting Manchester United.",
      "\"There are a lot of Leeds fans as well, but the majority will be Manchester United supporters. And that's why we say there is so much in Sweden for us to work with when it comes to building the Swedish Manchester United fan community.\"",
      "The day after the event, United and Leeds played out a 0-0 draw and the game wasn't a great spectacle, but it was all about getting minutes into the players' legs ahead of the United States tour.",
      "Over the next few weeks, Ruben Amorim will hope to lay the foundations for a successful season and Sorkie said he was firmly behind the 40-year-old ahead of his first full season in charge.",
      "\"I'm slightly optimistic because we have the chance to have a great pre-season,\" he said. \"We can build the team around what Ruben Amorim is thinking and what he wants to get out of the team.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo will change the dynamic in the team. I'm a little bit excited because there will be new players who are are equipped for that kind of system.\"",
      "Sorkie continued: \"It will be a lot better [the new season] because what was sad was Amorim came in during the middle of the season and he had to take all the players who weren't his choice.",
      "\"And now we're starting to see okay, with all the players that he inherited, does he actually want them with him? Which are going to fit in his system? And what does he need for the future to succeed?",
      "\"I think he has the knowledge and skills to change the team. He showed that at Sporting Lisbon. With the right players, with the right philosophy, we can achieve great stuff.\""

      "Cunha started in United's goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm, where the £62.5million signing from Wolves played 45 minutes.",
      "The Brazilian was joined in the starting line-up by fellow arrival Diego Leon, who played on the left wing before he was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time.",
      "Cunha operated as one of the two No.10s, with Toby Collyer surprisingly selected in a more advanced role. Bruno Fernandes played in central midfield and is expected to remain there when the competitive campaign begins.",
      "Fernandes was partnered by Casemiro, United's starting duo in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May. Amorim conceded United have a \"lack of pace\" in midfield.",
      "\"We suffered a little bit when we tried to press high,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"They kicked the ball with the second ball, they were dangerous in that moment.",
      "\"We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park, and you can feel that's hard to bring the ball. But we create chances, I think Matheus Cunha showed what we need, that he's the player when he receives the ball between the lines, he can be really aggressive in the direction of the opponent.",
      "\"We have a lot to do but it was the first test against a Premier League team with two different teams, so it was a big test.",
      "\"We watched [Cunha] during last season in a different team, so we expect the same thing. You can see the connection between him and Bruno (Fernandes) is still not there but it's going to be a good connection because you can put a player like Kobbie (Mainoo) there, Mason Mount there. We have to increase our quality in the final third.",
      "\"We have to understand that the kid (Leon) came from Paraguay and it's his second week in Manchester United. He did really well, he's learning things, he's powerful. He's going to be a very good player.\"",
      "United fly to Chicago on Tuesday for their three-game pre-season tour in the Premier League Summer Series. After the club's worst campaign in 51 years, Amorim is desperate to cultivate a harmonious environment as United prepare for their first fixture of the forthcoming season against Arsenal in four weeks.",
      "\"I felt the environment is really good,\" he added. \"Sometimes we are going to struggle but we struggle together, and that is the beginning of everything. And then we have to put the quality, this club is not just about the effort, you have to have the quality you have to win games.",
      "\"We need to create that bond between everybody, not just them but the staff. All the changes are stopping, so we need to leave that as a group, we have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. And we are going to improve.\""

      "Speaking before his arrival, Leon promised to \"kill it\" in pre-season, and he has impressed coaches in training at Carrington, which suggests he could have a role to play in Ruben Amorim's senior squad.",
      "That means Dorgu could face competition from Leon for his starting role at left-wing, but the Denmark international praised his new teammate and believes he can help United this season.",
      "\"He's a top, top player,\" said Dorgu. \"He's a good player, he's good for everyone. Everyone has competition in their positions. Every player has two or three players in their position. It's just going to help the team even more. Everyone's going to be on their toes, everyone's going to give 100 per cent to the team.\"",
      "The left-back also discussed Matheus Cunha, adding: \"He's a tough player, he did really well last season with Wolves. Hopefully he can bring all the good qualities to us.",
      "\"You can see today he's good carrying the ball, he's good in the small combination play. He can score goals and that's what we need. I think everyone is excited to see him play.\"",
      "Dorgu's fellow countryman, Rasmus Hojlund, was included in the wholesale changes for the second half against Leeds.",
      "Dorgu was asked whether Hojlund could get back to his best after taking a backwards step last season and responded: \"I think most of the players had a step back last season. I think everyone wants to redeem themselves this season and I think Rasmus is the same.\"",

      "In total, the United boss handed minutes to 24 members of his 29-man travelling squad, ensuring plenty got minutes under their belts at the first available opportunity this pre-season.",
      "The closest United came to a goal was not long before the end when Kobbie Mainoo headed against the bar after Rasmus Hojlund headed a corner back across the face of goal that caused all kinds of confusion.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Tom Heaton has reaffirmed his hunger to earn regular minutes after a strong showing in the second half of Saturday's 0-0 draw with Leeds United at the Strawberry Arena in Stockholm.",
      "The 39-year-old stopper was introduced at half-time in United's pre-season opener, replacing Altay Bayindir, as head coach Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at the interval.",
      "Heaton, who signed a new one-year contract at Old Trafford last month, fully justified his 45-minute cameo, making a couple of brilliant saves to deny Leeds duo Jayden Bogle and Largie Ramazani.",

      "He was replaced by youngster Tyler Fredricson, who took his place in the back-three alongside Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro for the final 10 minutes of United's opening pre-season friendly.",

      "Hugill was also on target in United's final friendly before the tour last year against Rangers at Murrayfield. After an unfulfilling loan at League One side Wigan Athletic was cut short, he ended the season on the Carlisle bench as they were relegated to the National League. Hugill is now at League Two Barnet and his last 12 months could make for a power point presentation to keep every United youngster grounded.",

      "Steady performance. 6",

      "The full-time whistle goes at the Strawberry Arena and United's pre-season opener ends exactly as it started.",
      "That was a chance for United to win it. Dalot cuts the ball back to the edge of the box for Dorgu, who has drifted inside, and he fires it over the top.",
      "There will be a minimum of three additional minutes at the end of this game.",
      "How have United not scored? A corner comes in, his headed back across the face of goal by Hojlund and Mainoo heads the ball against the bar. The ball then bounces around the box and Heaven is denied by Meslier.",
      "Amorim makes another alteration;",
      "OFF: Mantato",
      "ON: J. Fletcher",
      "Ramazani has been really lively since coming on at half-time for Leeds. He has just cut inside off the left and curled a low, right-footed effort towards goal that drew another save from Heaton.",
      "Amorim makes his first change since the break;",
      "OFF: Maguire",
      "ON: Fredricson",
      "The game has stopped for the second half drinks break.",
      "Ugarte has a go from range, drawing a comfortable save from Meslier, but the midfielder did not get enough power or conviction on the shot.",
      "Heaton has done his chances of starting a game in the US no harm at all since coming on at half-time. He has just made a smart stop to deny Ramazani. The Leeds winger will be disappointed not to have scored.",
      "Not for the first time, Hojlund has gone berserk at Dalot. \"F**k's sake,\" he shouted there. No progress there after San Sebastian.",
      "Heaton comes to United's rescue, denying Bogle, who was slipped in by Piroe. The United shot-stopper spread himself well to deny the Whites full-back.",
      "United have started this second half better than they did the first. They have had more of the ball and they are frequently trying to bring Dalot into play on the right. The Portuguese defender has put in a couple of teasing crosses since being introduced.",
      "Leeds boss Daniel Farke has also made a crop of changes at the break, making eight in total. Among those to have come include former United players Daniel James and Largie Ramazani.",
      "The second half is underway in Stockholm. Ruben Amorim, as expected, has made 11 changes at the break.",
      "Amorim has made wholesale changes to the team, as expected.",

      "Great to see Mantato on the pitch - this is a big moment for the youngster.",
      "Straw-clutching time for MUTV, as they go on about Diogo Dalot's squad number. Seeing Mark Sullivan front the coverage is a reminder that he arguably killed the televised player of the year awards when he interviewed England cricket great and United fan Geoffrey Boycott at the 2019 do.",
      "Sullivan looked like a hostage in a video as Boycott typically and bluntly took apart United's performance that season.",
      "The officials have a sick sense of humour to add another minute to that half. The players will be writing '45 minutes in the tank' with a loading emoji on their Instagram posts after that.",

      "Most exciting player (also not saying much). 7",
      "Obi",
      "Forced Darlow into a save and dragged one wide. 6",
      "The half-time whistle goes at the Strawberry Arena and it remains goalless.",
      "Casemiro just hit the bar and placed his hands on his head. The Brazilian has been off the pace during the first half and is set to be replaced. Amorim sent 12 players to warm-up before the interval and you would expect wholesale changes.",
      "That was the best piece of play in the half by far and Chido Obi made the wrong call. That was set up for Cunha, who you'd have backed to hit the target at the very least. He was well within his rights to rebuke Obi, whose movement was good but decision-making was not so good.",
      "Casemiro takes aim from distance on his weaker left foot and the ball goes over the top of the bar to a chorus of jeers from the Leeds fans."

      "Amorim said he needed to see whether Cunha understood the position, but that he shouldn't need to think too much\". And the first sign of teething problems came just a few minutes into the match when Toby Collyer had to urge Cunha to take up a more advanced role.",
      "Collyer only broke into the first-team last season. He made his debut against Liverpool in September and lacks experience, but it's reassuring he possesses the confidence to instruct a senior teammate.",
      "Cunha was in communication with a teammate himself, telling new signing Diego Leon to keep his width. Leon was essentially hugging the left touchline when United tried to build-up.",
      "Leeds targeted Leon's side in the opening exchanges and the dynamic Wilfried Gnoto asked a few questions, but there was a lack of quality from both sides in important areas.",
      "So much so that Amorim dished out tactical instructions to Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Cunha during a drinks interval. The pace had been mundane and the manager clearly wanted a little bit more from the players.",
      "Casemiro looked off the pace and lazily fired a shot over the bar on the cusp of the break. The 33-year-old provided value in the Europa League last season but should not be starting for United in 2025/2026.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui looked in good physical condition, which helped him to be United's best player in the first half. Cunha was the most exciting player in the first 45 minutes, although there was no competition for that prize.",
      "Cunha did provide a glimpse into what he will bring to the table, though. He executed step-overs and won a foul. Then he was fouled again closer to Leeds' penalty area. He is certainly worth buying a ticket to watch and will provide entertainment this season, along with cutting edge in front of goal.",
      "The forward scored 17 goals in a struggling Wolves side and the prospect of Cunha playing alongside Bryan Mbeumo, who will join United on their tour of the USA next week, has generated a buzz.",
      "Opening pre-season friendlies can look similar to training drills and the players who started conducted a warm down on the pitch under the guidance of Emanuel Ferro when it was half-time.",
      "Amorim replaced the entire XI at the break and gave an opportunity to Bendito Mantato who has impressed in training. The 17-year-old was deployed in the right side No.10 position, but has the qualities to excel at wing-back. The youngster was previously a left-back before being moved to the right wing by coaches.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was among those who came on for the second half and this season will be significant for the 20-year-old, who hasn't been able to nail down a regular starting place under Amorim.",
      "Mainoo's momentum was disrupted by small injuries last term and there are doubts about which position he suits best. He played in the pivot in Stockholm and perhaps Amorim will settle on an answer this summer.",
      "The academy graduate improved United and sprayed a handful of long-range passes, giving them an outlet from midfield, and Mainoo objectively looks more comfortable in those areas.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who also played the second half, looked buoyant when he received warm applause from the Scandinavian fans before kick-off. Hojlund took huge steps backward last season but looks set to stay for the new campaign. He appreciated the support in Sweden and will be hungry to bounce back.",
      "Tom Heaton made two brilliant saves to deny Leeds after the break. Heaton replaced Bayindir at the interval and should replace him as second-choice goalkeeper.",
      "Rosenborg defeated United 1-0 in Norway for the opening pre-season friendly of last summer, and it's always impossible to gauge too much from the first friendly of pre-season. Some will joke the goalless draw against Leeds represents progress after the Rosenborg starter 12 months ago.",
      "United will now fly back to Manchester and prepare for the USA tour. They travel to the States on Tuesday and will be primarily based in Chicago for the three-game schedule.",

      "It is reported that Spanish giants Barcelona are working on a move for the 27-year-old with the player keen on a move to the Nou Camp. Barca are keen on signing a wide player this summer with a deal for Nico Williams falling through after he opted to stay with Athletic Club.",

      "Rashford has sounded out Spanish intermediaries to try and engineer a move to the Catalan side",

This is the job from Deco, is clear, and I will support him.”",

And the binary certainty of Arsenal’s only two possible outcomes – signing Gyokeres and winning the league or not signing Gyokeres and finishing second – is classic Keysey.",

      "But come on. This is just fannying for fannying’s sake now, surely? This is a transfer that Arsenal can obviously afford, for the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable at any Premier League club, a transfer for which the player himself is overwhelmingly keen and to which now the only major obstacles appear to be Arsenal themselves and clown-car banter club Man United still hanging around and honking their horn as the bumper falls off the car, which despite being small is able to seat an unimaginably large collection of unwanted yet seemingly unsellable bomb squad players.",
      "Clearly, chucking unnecessary money at a transfer is not necessarily wise or the best course. But there also must come a time when stubbornly continuing to argue and haggle over the structure of a few million pounds in payments becomes self-defeating. Even if you get the deal at the price/structure/whatever you initially wanted, is it still the best deal if that player – one so obviously vital to Arsenal’s whole season plan – doesn’t arrive until deep into pre-season?",
      "The campaign is now less than a month away. It is already reason enough to stop counting every penny in a transfer of this importance.",
      "Unlike Keysey we cannot be certain that Gyokeres will prove to be the silver bullet Arsenal have been searching for. There are no certainties in the transfer game, and Gyokeres is undeniably costly for a player unproven in Europe’s top leagues.",
      "But there are more reasons to suppose he is precisely what Arsenal require. Precisely what Arsenal have required for years now. And there can be no suggestion Arsenal haven’t done due diligence. Whatever else Arsenal’s pursuit of that long-awaited and obviously-needed striker could be accused of being, let nobody accuse them of being rushed or hasty.",
      "Comparing one transfer to another is another risky business, because no two deals are the same, but it’s impossible not to notice the alacrity with which Liverpool have moved on to and apparently secured the signing of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt in their own release-clause-adjacent striker pursuit.",
      "Yes, it’s unfair to compare the two very different deals. And we’re not saying Arsenal should have gone for Ekitike either, especially with the Emirates being surely the most unforgiving place a Temu Thierry Henry could attempt to succeed.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t adding to the frustration for Arsenal fans. They were already playing catch-up and watching Liverpool address what is for them a secondary issue while Arsenal are still doing some sums on their most important bit of business since signing Declan Rice cannot be helping.",

      "This way for some glorious bullsh*t about Manchester City and Cole Palmer. There could be something in the James Trafford links, though…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nApparently, Pep Guardiola is ‘determined’ to bring back Palmer at all costs and a £147million offer is on its way to Chelsea. It’s not, though, is it? Next.\n19) Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker and the player’s agent is pushing him back towards Serie A. But United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. So this feels like a non-starter.",
      "",
      "18) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBack here again, are we? Apparently so, according to reports in Portugal. The stories go that United are close to an agreement with Sporting, which sounds very convenient for the Portuguese club, but its is a tactic that has already failed, so we cannot see why they would flog that particular dead horse if there was nothing in it. Gyokeres has made clear his intention to move to Arsenal, but he, like us, must be close to losing hope. If he did go to United now, the Arsenal meltdown would be spectacular.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Tottenham \nThis all sounds very tentative and driven by the players’ representatives seemingly exploring the midfielder’s options should he return to the Premier League amid expectations that he might not get the same playing time this season. Spurs are said to appreciate Gallagher and Newcastle are sniffing too. If anything happens here, it won’t be for a while yet.",
      "",
      "16) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "",
      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "14) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "10) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "9) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nThis seems to be reaching its inevitable conclusion sooner than we thought. We knew Rashford would go on loan, probably to Barca, but we thoroughly expected United to drag it out. It’s almost to their credit that they haven’t, even if the fact they can’t sell Rashford for actual money is a mess largely of their own making. It seems the only sticking point is how much the buy option would be at the end of a season-long loan. Whatever it becomes, Barca probably can’t afford it. But that isn’t stopping them from covering his entire salary, for which United should be grateful.",
      "",
      "4) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal have missed Arteta’s deadline for Gyokeres to be on the flight to Singapore and some reports in Portugal suggest the deal could be jeopardy, with add-ons still to be negotiated and solidarity payments to be sorted. Gyokeres’ agents are working their nuts off but they don’t seem to be having much joy. To the contrary: the player’s father is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ while Gyokeres himself is distancing himself from London. We genuinely thought this one was done, but it’s a saga that’s had more fake endings than Lord of the f*cking Rings. For all the good work Arsenal have done this summer, if they screw this up…",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. But with Fabrizio Romano now giving this one the ‘here we go’ treatment it appears only a matter of time before Ekitike joins Liverpool’s big list of summer signings. Certainly, personal terms should pose few problems given the player himself seems unsurprisingly enormously keen.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThis is done, apparently, with images leaked of the defender in his Arsenal training kit. The paperwork is still being ratified, but the delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth over Viktor Gyokeres’ future after claims Man Utd are ahead of Arsenal for the signing.",
      "The Red Devils are desperate to bring in a new striker as their next signing after they agreed a fee to bring Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo on Friday.",
      "Mbeumo will join Matheus Cunha, who arrived from Wolves in a £62.5m deal earlier in the summer, and Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon at Old Trafford as their first three signings.",
      "And there have been rumours over the weekend that Man Utd are now seriously interested in hijacking Arsenal’s deal to sign Gyokeres from Sporting CP this summer.",
      "Arsenal have so far struggled to get a deal over the line despite weeks of negotiations and a report on Sunday claimed that the Red Devils are now the ‘most advanced’ club in the race for Gyokeres.",
      "But Romano now has an update on the Sweden international’s future and addresses the rumours about interest from Man Utd, he said on his YouTube channel: “I want to clarify something about Man Utd and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "READ: The super secret transfer release clauses Forest and other clubs might sue us for revealing",
      "“Some very important outlets in Portugal are reporting that Man Utd have been working on a deal for Gyokeres in recent days.",
      "“Earlier this week, I told you that Man Utd will sign an important striker this summer. Not that Cunha and Mbeumo are done, the focus for them is the striker and many agents in the market are aware about this.",
      "“For example, someone internally at Eintracht Frankfurt expected Man Utd to try to enter the race for Ekitike when the deal collapsed with Newcastle. Man Utd were calling to be informed on the situation with Ekitike, but the player decided to go to Liverpool and there was no chance to enter into the deal.",
      "“What about Gyokeres? I’m not aware of an official bid from Man Utd and I’m not aware of club-to-club talks. Despite intermediaries suggesting the opportunity for Man Utd to enter into the deal for Gyokeres, it’s very clear that Gyokeres wants to go to Arsenal. He is only convinced about the Arsenal project and he agreed personal terms with them two weeks ago.”",
      "Man Utd have also been linked with a move for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson and Romano has touched on that as well as other transfer talking points at Old Trafford.",
      "Romano added: “I told you earlier in the week that Nicolas Jackson is an option for Man Utd. At the moment, I’m not aware of talks ongoing with Chelsea, but Man Utd are informed about the situation of Jackson. They know that the player is not untouchable at Chelsea and so they are aware of the eventual conditions for his exit this summer.",
      "“While at Chelsea there is still an appreciation for Alejandro Garnacho for example. So maybe that could be a scenario, but at the moment there is not a negotiation. At the moment there is no club-to-club talks about that.",
      "“But, Man Utd are expected to go for a striker and one of the names being mentioned internally in the recent weeks is also Benjamin Sesko, another player who is well known at Manchester United. But before entering into concrete negotiations, we have to wait and see what’s going to happen internally at Man Utd in terms of outgoings.",
      "“Marcus Rashford is going to Barcelona, but then there is Jadon Sancho, there is Antony and there is Alejandro Garnacho, so that’s going to be really important.”",
      "Arsenal could make a ‘sudden switch’ from interest in Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres to Newcastle United’s Alexander Isak, according to reports.",
      "Sporting CP have turned to Man Utd over a deal for Viktor Gyokeres after Arsenal have gone slightly cold on the deal, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are mucking about over minor details of the most final-piece-in-the-puzzle signing imaginable as the clock ticks louder and louder.",
      "Arsenal fans believe Mikel Arteta may have hinted at Viktor Gyokeres’ arrival while praising Andrea Berta’s role in the club’s transfer success.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘most advanced’ in the race to sign Viktor Gyokeres as INEOS have offered a ‘slightly higher’ fee than Arsenal for the Sporting striker."

      "He said: “There must have been so much going on behind the scenes that we’re just not aware of.",
      "“And Marcus isn’t someone who really wants to talk and do interviews, so you have to respect that.",
      "“But I’m sure it’ll come out in the wash at some point. Is it because of a lack of form? A lack of confidence? Mismanagement? Have the club failed him?",
      "“Or is it down to him? Is there injuries we don’t know about? Has he lost that desire? That form is gone and he can’t rekindle it and can’t get it back?",
      "“What are the issues that have led to a young kid that’s a graduate of the academy at Manchester United, which is famous for all of the great players that have come through there, that he says he wants to leave?”",
      "Indeed, there have been varying reports on the future of the United man in recent weeks and months. While Barca has seemed his priority, it was once suggested he’d be happy to bed back in at Old Trafford.",
      "If that was the case, it does not seem United shared the sentiment. Then, not long back, it was suggested he was one of a few Red Devils who had asked to leave the club.",
      "Rashford was joined on that list by Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "At Barca, surrounded by talent, Rashford might be able to hit the heights again, and that would certainly rub United’s faces in it after they allowed him to move on.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice.",
      "Paul Pogba insists that Man Utd “are losing a great player” in Marcus Rashford ahead of an imminent transfer to La Liga side Barcelona.",
      "Man Utd have slashed the permanent transfer option fee for Marcus Rashford to force through his transfer to Barcelona this summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly sanctioned a gargantuan pay cut to facilitate his loan to Barcelona, who have a ‘verbal agreement’ with Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona are ‘advancing’ to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford, with David Ornstein revealing two key details."

      "Manchester United have reportedly held ‘talks’ with a star striker who is available after ending a loan spell with a European giant, and is now a ‘priority target’ for the Red Devils.",
      "United have been linked with some of Europe’s hottest strikers this summer. The likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins have all been linked.",
      "Though interest in Sesko has resurfaced of late, it’s believed that move will only be possible through player sales.",
      "But there is now interest in Randal Kolo Muani, after Juventus declined the chance to sign him permanently following a 10-goal and three-assist loan spell there in the second half of last season, seemingly making him available for a move given Paris Saint-Germain don’t appear keen on him anymore.",
      "The move would have been for around £50million, and given it hasn’t been taken, United have a chance to land their ‘priority target’, as he’s been described in a recent report.",
      "It’s unclear if they’d be able to afford the £50million without player sales, though reports have suggested that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could both be moved on soon.",
      "And United might have already made small progress on the signing of Kolo Muani.",
      "It is reported by journalist Sacha Tavolieri that ‘recent talks took place’ with United over the transfer. It is not clear if any progress was made by the Premier League club in those talks.",
      "Meanwhile, it’s believed that Aston Villa ‘could attack’ if Watkins is sold, while Newcastle – though focussed on Yoane Wissa – have also ‘made an approach’ for if Alexander Isak leaves.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘ready to step up’ their interest in a Belgian goalkeeper amid concern over an injury to No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "United have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper this summer. Indeed, it’s been suggested they have lost patience with incumbent keeper Onana, given his propensity to be involved in errors leading to goals.",
      "However, Onana doesn’t look likely to be going anywhere, but he has now been ruled out for the next six weeks. That saw Altay Bayindir play in a friendly against Leeds on Saturday, and means Onana will be out until the end of August.",
      "United will likely have played at least their first two Premier League games by then.",
      "As such, talkSPORT reports United are ‘ready to step up’ their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, with the hunt for a new keeper required given Onana’s injury.",
      "Lammens is said to be valued by his current club at around £17million.",
      "Lammens is already aware of United interest from earlier in the summer, and feels he’s suited to the challenge.",
      "“The first time I heard I thought, ‘Wow.’ Immediately a world [renowned] team that follows you. That is special.",
      "“Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that [from colleagues]… It’s only positive.",
      "“Especially because it’s the best competition in the world and my profile, my stature and way of playing, is similar to English football. You have to physically hold your own there and that suits me.”",
      "Whether Lammens would be able to displace Onana once and for all when both are fit remains to be seen, but that the incumbent is injured at the start of the season will mean for an interesting situation.",
      "Indeed, if United are willing to change starters when Onana is fit, as has looked likely over the summer, then if Lammens performs well at the beginning of the campaign, he might well be able to keep the No.1 spot.",
      "The Belgian, 23, kept 10 clean sheets in all competitions last season, which is one fewer than Onana, though Lammens has a far better save percentage from last season, and if he could continue that in the Premier League, he’d be a better asset than United’s current keeper.",
      "Whether the move does go ahead remains to be seen, but United will begin to push harder soon.",
      "A former Man Utd player has urged Ruben Amorim to ditch a struggling Reds player and bring in ‘legs and energy’ to fix the midfield.",
      "Man Utd and Leeds are chasing a new number one as their long-running rivalry spills into a transfer battle over a top-performing European keeper.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana only joined Untied two years ago but already looks to be heading out the door if the club get their way.",

      "",
      "19=) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "19=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "10=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",

      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "10=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "7=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "3) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",

      "The England international enjoyed a productive six months on loan at Aston Villa last term but snubbed a permanent switch to Villa Park after they failed to qualify for the Champions League despite the West Midland club holding a £40m option to secure his permanent signing.",
      "He’s only had eyes for Barcelona and after the Catalans were snubbed by Nico Williams and backed away from a possible move for Luis Diaz over Liverpool’s demands, they’ve now reached an agreement with Rashford and Manchester United.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote on X: ‘BREAKING: Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, here we go! Verbal agreement in principle between all parties involved with Barça planning for medical tests next days. Loan deal with buy option, details being finalised today then Man Utd will authorize his travel to Spain.’",
      "It was thought that Rashford’s wage of around £325,000 a week might pose a problem, with Barcelona either unwilling or unable to cover that salary quite as much as Villa, who were paying around 90% of it during his six-month stay.",

      "That ‘concession’ means Barcelona can cover the entirety of his wage, which Manchester United will be able to write off their books for a season.",
      "Mundo Deportivo have revealed a different wage cut, claiming Rashford has ‘given up 25% of his salary to fulfil his dream’, which means he would be taking home around £243,000 per week, while providing further detail on his Barcelona contract.",
      "They confirm that the purchase option agreed is ‘not mandatory’ but that the fixed fee for the option is just €30m [£26m] – a significant drop to the fee Villa were required to pay this summer, and much lower than Transfermarkt’s €50m [£43m] valuation.",

      "We’re still waiting on some stragglers and official releases, so do check back for further updates, but here are our objectively correct rankings of the Premier League’s 25/26 home kits for you to enjoy and not get unnecessarily cross about.",
      "Remember, these are the correct opinions.",
      "Big themes for this season include: round collars, local ‘inspiration’ and more immediately obvious divergence between ‘replica’ and ‘authentic’ versions of shirts. We’re not really happy about any of those themes, if we’re honest.",
      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",
      "TBC. Sunderland\nWe’ve seen a few leaks and they’re mainly terrible, but no confirmation yet for what is actually the kit. It’s hummel, so it should be good. Which is the main reason we’re remaining too sceptical to rank based on those current upsetting leaks.",
      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",
      "— Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) July 4, 2025",
      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

      "And now we don’t know at all. We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",
      "And it’s not even like City have plucked a sash from nowhere either. Sure, it’s never been on the home kit before, but they have a proud away-kit sash history that dates well back into the before times of the 1970s and whatnot.",
      "As for an actual final call on whether this kit is brilliant or bad, we shall strive to arrive at a definitive decision within 28 business days.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nA new home shirt is an event in itself after they took the now wildly unusual step of keeping the old one for two years. It’s certainly an interesting one to mark the switch from Umbro to Joma, and while we really want to like it, it’s not quite right.",
      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "— Brentford FC (@BrentfordFC) July 4, 2025",
      "We’re not sold on the white sleeves, though. In our view it tilts the balance of red and white too far in favour of white, and not even the primarily red back for the name-sets can quite save that.",
      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",
      "Our new Head Coach 🙌 pic.twitter.com/lS0xDZJMLn",
      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "14) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "13) Fulham\nUnofficial for now, but it follows last year’s lead on being a predominantly white effort with far less black than we’ve seen previously. Here it is once again reduced to the adidas stripes, the collar and a bit of piping.",
      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nWe will always prefer even stripes which puts this latest Bournemouth effort on the back foot from the start. The sand-effect red stripes are already thicker than the black ones here even before further red bordering is added in. A shame, because it’s actually rather good apart from that.",

      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) July 15, 2025",
      "We’re not even going to bother looking up the PR spiel as it will only annoy us and instead we’ll just go right ahead and assume the sand motif is once again drawing inspiration from the local area and okay, fine, whatever. The gold trim is nicely understated and swerves all accusations of gaudiness. If the thickness of the stripes were sorted out we’d be very happy with this. Not that they asked or care. Honestly, some people.",
      "",
      "11) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) July 1, 2025",
      "",
      "10) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",
      "pic.twitter.com/JbimZktGYA",
      "— Everton (@Everton) June 27, 2025",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",
      "",
      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

      "We reserve the right to alter this ranking if the actual shirt disappoints, but at this stage we’re very excited about this one.",
      "",
      "4) West Ham\nUmbro have done some fine retro work with West Ham in recent years, and it all comes together here in this shiny and powerfully early 80s effort. Even the BoyleSports logo looks like it’s from 1983.",

      "Also, while we generally restrict our rankings here to the tops, given the amount of switching and alternate use that goes on with shorts and socks anyway, it is worth noting that West Ham have this year’s best socks, with the stripes of the collar and cuffs deployed simply but expertly.",
      "",
      "3) Wolves\nYes, we like this. That’s a pleasingly modern take on a proper old-fashioned collar, and the whole retro vibe is enhanced by a material that almost looks knitted.",
      "Again, we could be wrong because we’re only at this stage going off pictures rather than real-world information, but it does look like the lads at Sudu have got the colour right this time. Fingers crossed anyway, but it definitely looks more gold than last season’s just too yellow offering.",
      "We generally leave sponsors out of these as far as we can, because let’s face it pretty much all of them spoil a shirt to some degree or other, but DEBET’s logo being all black this year rather than having colour on the ‘toothpaste’ bit of the first E also definitely helps Wolves stick the retro-vibe landing here.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over month for Mbeumo, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",

      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",

That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",

      "Manchester United, it's almost like you never left.",
      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",
      "Obi taking the ball off Cunha's toes and Amorim admitting his relationship with Fernandes \"is not there yet\" meant it was a slow start in his new colours.",
      "And Hojlund's display showed more frustration - falling over the ball at one stage in the box and then getting in the way of a late Dorgu strike.",
      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
      "Amad Diallo also looked sharp at wing-back - which is important in the context of Mbeumo coming into the team.",
      "But United need a lot more than the Brentford man to improve this attacking set-up. There's still a need for a new striker, plus more clarity in midfield and out wide.",

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 12:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "That could impact Tottenham, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, who have all shown an interest in signing Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Newcastle also turned their attention to Wissa after seeing their pursuit of Hugo Ekitike hijacked by Liverpool. The Magpies are currently focusing on recruiting defenders before addressing their attacking situation.",
      "Spurs expressed an interest in Mbeumo before he opted for Man Utd as his first choice, with former Brentford boss Thomas Frank also keen to be reunited with Wissa.",
      "However, Spurs have already addressed their attack by signing Mohammed Kudus for £55m, as well as putting in a contentious £60m bid for Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White.",
      "Brentford believe selling both Mbeumo and Wissa would be such a significant loss of goals and attacking talent that it would be near-impossible for the club to recover via the transfer market.",
      "In a summer of significant change that has seen head coach Frank join Tottenham and their captain Christian Norgaard join Arsenal, selling both Mbeumo and Wissa is seen as a risk too significant to take.",
      "So United agreeing a deal for Mbeumo would almost certainly rule out the sale of Wissa, who has a year left on his contract, plus an option of a further year.",
      "As news of Mbeumo's £71m fee from United being agreed came through, Brentford sent out an image of Wissa in training on their social media channels.",
      "The forward returned to Brentford's training ground for pre-season training on Monday, alongside Mbeumo - who is now on his way to Manchester.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, could well replace Mbeumo with Ipswich Town's Omari Hutchinson.",
      "The two clubs held talks on Tuesday ahead of a 5pm deadline on his £35m relegation clause.",
      "Brentford are understood to have reached the levels of the clause but an agreement did not materialise over the structure of the payments.",
      "Hutchinson is understood to be keen on a move to Brentford and is disappointed a deal was not agreed between the clubs.",
      "Brentford remain interested but Ipswich have no intention of selling him despite their relegation to the Championship. He has four years left on his contract.",
      "AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!"
