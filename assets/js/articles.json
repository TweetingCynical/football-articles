      "Manchester United have splashed the cash this summer - but there is still time for more for the Red Devils. The transfer window closes on Monday evening and there are still some major deals in the pipeline.",
      "One of them involves striker Rasmus Hojlund, who looks set to complete a move away from Old Trafford over the coming days. He could well be followed by a number of teammates including Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Should all of those leave, it could potentially open the door to more new arrivals for the under-fire Ruben Amorim. A midfielder and a new goalkeeper are potentially on the agenda but some serious work needs to be done for those two signings to be completed.",
      "Any more transfers would take United’s summer spending to well over £200m this summer - albeit it has not shown on the pitch so far amid their indifferent results.",
      "With that being said, take a look at all of the Manchester United transfer rumours ahead of today’s Premier League clash with Burnley :",
      "United striker Rasmus Hojlund is set to bid farewell to Manchester United after agreeing a move to Serie A champions Napoli. The Italian side will sign the Dane on loan with an obligation to buy included in the agreement.",
      "Napoli will hand the Red Devils a £5m loan fee for Hojlund, as part of an overall package that could see United earn more than £43m. The Italian champions would be forced to pay £38m should a number of conditions be met.",
      "Despite that, United would still be in line to lose a huge amount having spent around £72m to sign him from Atalanta. Hojlund, 22, has scored just 26 goals in all competitions since then.",
      "Royal Antwerp manager Stef Wils has broken his silence on goalkeeper Senne Lammens amid reported interest from Man United. Lammens has been installed as the Red Devils’ number one target amid their search for a new goalkeeper.",
      "Lammens missed last weekend’s game vs Mechelen and is also expected to be sidelined in Antwerp’s latest outing. Speaking on Friday, Wils said: \"Senne is following an individual program, in consultation with all parties. That’s a logical decision. Since this could be a major outgoing transfer, we want to minimise the risk of injuries.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho now appears to be on the verge of becoming a Chelsea player. The Argentine was in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday as the Blues hosted Fulham.",
      "United and Chelsea have already thrashed out a deal that will see the London club pay around £40m for the Argentine’s services.",
      "An announcement over his move is expected imminently as his five-year spell at Old Trafford comes to an end.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Red Devils needed an intervention from VAR late in stoppage time to down the Clarets with their skipper stepping up to seal the 3-2 win. The victory was United's first of the season and extremely well timed following their Carabao Cup embarrassment in midweek.",
      "Amorim's side were knocked out by Grimsby on penalties. The League Two side winning 12-11 in the shootout with Bryan Mbeumo missing the decisive penalty. The Portuguese coach caught the attention after choosing not to watch any of the spot kicks.",
      "He repeated that when Fernandes, who had blazed over from the penalty spot in last weekend's draw at Fulham, stepped up with the game on the line as Amorim claimed he wanted to see how the home supporters would react.",
      "After gazing towards the Stretford End he said: \"I like to see the image of the fans. What has to be has to be. In that moment, I was thinking it would be fair to win the game – and I did not think Bruno would miss a second in a row.\"",
      "The United boss has struggled to oversee an upturn in form throughout his 10 months in charge and has often spoken his mind after defeats. Prior to the Burnley clash he admitted he thinks of quitting his role on occasion as he wears his heart on his sleeve.",
      "He said: \"I know sometimes it’s me that starts that. I’m really emotional. But when you look at the context what we lived in the past months, you can understand. I want to be in a different way during the weeks, and for that you need to win. So today was a must-win and we won. Let’s move on.\"",
      "United's winning penalty came after Jaidon Anthony was adjudged to have pulled Amad Diallo’s shirt inside the box. Refereee Sam Barrott was sent to the monitor by VAR and, as is often the case, a penalty was awarded.",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker was angry that referee Sam Barrott was sent to the monitor after VAR official Stuart Attwell spotted Jaidon Anthony was adjudged to have pulled Amad Diallo’s shirt inside the box.",
      "Clarets boss Scott Parker said: \"I'm gutted for the fans and I'm gutted for the players because the game gets decided on a last-minute VAR call that obviously makes us not get the point that I felt we deserved. The ref doesn't give it, the linesman don't give it, he's 10 metres away. The guy 100 miles away has decided that it's a clear and obvious error from the ref, and then obviously it's a penalty.\"",

      "Manchester United bosses still fear that Ruben Amorim could WALK OUT - despite seeing his team salvage a huge win over Burnley thanks to captain Bruno Fernandes’ injury-time penalty. United secured their first victory of the new season in a dramatic ­finale just as newly-promoted ­ Burnley looked set to deliver another devastating blow to the beleaguered boss.",
      "Reds’ chiefs remain steadfast in their belief that Amorim can turn around the team. But the 40-year-old needs to ­control the erratic behaviour that has become a cause for concern.",
      "Talk was rife inside Old Trafford in the aftermath of the seismic ­Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby on Wednesday night that Amorim might be ready to walk away during the international break regardless of the result against Burnley. That prospect may have subsided for now after the boost of a dramatic first victory of the new season.",
      "But Amorim said: “I’m not thinking about a turning point. I’ve had this conversation with you guys like 10 times. It’s day by day. I’m happy. We returned a little bit to our level today.",
      "“If you take away Wednesday, we are more consistent in the performance compared to last year. That’s a good thing.”",
      "Some senior players are disillusioned with Amorim’s steadfast commitment to the tactical formation that served him so well at Sporting Lisbon but does not fit the profile of his squad in Manchester.",
      "He has alienated others with his habit of going public with criticism they feel should be kept in-house. After the defeat at Blundell Park he admitted that sometimes he hated his players.",
      "Amorim has also not been afraid to voice his doubts about whether he is a good fit for the job.",
      "Alarm bells started ringing in the boardroom in May when Amorim declared he would be prepared to leave United without seeking a compensation package if he felt stepping away would benefit both himself and the club.",
      "He came out after the Burnley win to defend keeper Altay Bayindir after the Turkey international’s latest blunder allowed Jaidon Anthony to fire home the Clarets’ second equaliser.",
      "Amorim said: “Yes, in some moments [I hate the players]. But when they put in the effort, I will always love them. We need to understand that we should have always been on this level of effort.",
      "“We played well in the beginning. When the match was not so perfect, you can feel that the team struggled a little bit – but the effort was always there.",
      "“Guys, they are humans. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. But I think it’s hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "“The players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it’s not just the goalkeepers. Everybody has to improve.”",
      "United feel they have backed Amorim to the hilt – both in terms of transfer funds and banishing big-name players like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia from his squad.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo claimed that Manchester United’ s dramatic win vs Burnley was not just for under-fire Ruben Amorim - but for the whole club. The Red Devils boss had found himself under pressure following a dire start to the campaign.",
      "United failed to win each of their opening two Premier League games and saw their Carabao Cup journey ended at the first stage with a humiliating defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "But they managed to secure their first victory of the campaign on Saturday as they squeezed past Burnley 3-2 - Bruno Fernandes firing home a dramatic late penalty. Mbeumo also got on the scoresheet with his first Premier League goal for United.",
      "It was his second goal in as many games following his strike at Grimsby. Asked if the win was to ease the pressure on Amorim, he claimed that wasn’t the case.",
      "He said: \"We are all a team, it is not only one person. We all worked very hard for the win today.\"",
      "Mbeumo added: \"Every game is hard and important. We had the game with us in the first half, but we had to fight every minute. I'm very happy, and we win as well - as a striker, it is important to be confident with goals.\"",
      "And while Mbeumo was left delighted with United’s win, he pointed to the importance of getting back on track following their humiliation at Grimsby. He said: \"It's a big club, the expectations are high and we need to deal with it. But a great feeling to win here.",
      "\"With what happened in the week, we had to react with a win. That's what we've done.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Amorim claimed that United were full value for their win despite the fortuitous circumstances in which the win arrived. He said: \"It ended well, think we deserved to win the game. I think we created a lot of chances. We should go to the half-time with a bigger advantage.",
      "“And then…every possession near our box, they can score, we are in that moment, so we start always chasing a lot of things. But we deserved and we tried until the last minute to score goals, we had our chances and in the end we deserved to win.”",
      "United’s dramatic win against Burnley leaves them ninth in the Premier League on four points, with their beaten opponents two places behind. The Red Devils now have two weeks out of action due to the first international break of the season, while they have a clash with Manchester City to look forward to.",

      "And then he was gone. Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho has departed the Red Devils, leaving behind the Carrington 'Bomb Squad' of which he has been a part this summer, and completed his £40million move to Chelsea.",
      "The Argentina international, still just 21, has inked a deal with the Blues until 2032. His exit has been on the cards since he grew increasingly exasperated with his role under Ruben Amorim - despite being a regular under the Portuguese for much of last season - and finally spoke out after May's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, a match which he started on the bench.",
      "Days later, Amorim told Garnacho to find himself a new club this summer. Garnacho duly spent pre-season training away from United's first-team having expressed a desire to leave. And now he has his move, to long-time admirers, with Chelsea having initially sought to do a deal in January. As well as the £40m, United also hold a 10 percent sell-on clause.",
      "“It’s an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club,” Garnacho said, whose agents, Carlos Cambeiro and Quique de Lucas, were initially spotted at Stamford Bridge in January. “I can’t wait to get started.",
      "“I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special – we’re the best team in the world! It’s amazing to be here and I’m very happy.”",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and scored 26 goals in 144 appearances after progressing through the academy.",
      "He becomes Chelsea's ninth arrival of the summer and fifth attacking addition, following Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens, the Blues finally pushing through his signing after completing Christopher Nkunku's exit, the French international moving to AC Milan.",
      "But he also comes at the personal request of head coach Enzo Maresca, who believes the opportunity to add Garnacho to his attack - particularly at that price - was too good to pass up.",

      "If Ruben Amorim has full confidence in Benjamin Sesko he is not showing it. Sesko has been left on the bench in United's opening two Premier League games before making an underwhelming debut from the start in Wednesday night's embarrassment at Grimsby.",
      "He duly returned to the bench for the visit of Burnley. Amorim though had the ideal opportunity to bring him on earlier than planned when Matheus Cunha went down with an injury issue in the first-half. That problem would force him off, but rather than turn to his £74million signing in Sesko, he bought on Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has scored just seven goals during his time in Manchester, yet he was the man Amorim turned to, rather than Sesko himself.",
      "The Slovenian came on with 72 minutes on the clock as the game with Burnley was perfectly poised at 2-2, but he could not find the winning goal. His best chance came when he rose highest from a Bryan Mbeumo cross, only to head over when he should've done better. It was Bruno Fernandes who scored a 97th minute winner for the Red Devils as he converted from the spot in dramatic circumstances.",
      "It means Sesko remains looking for his first goal, although minutes have been at a premium. In United's opening three games Sesko has played just over 90 minutes.",
      "Compare that to Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, who has been thrown in straight away to lead the line and scored twice. That is what you'd expect from any player who costs north of £50m, but Sesko finds himself still waiting for his first Premier League start.",
      "United were beaten in a shootout by Grimsby in midweek, a Carabao Cup humiliation. Their new hitman waited for every other outfield player to step up before he chose to have a go from 12 yards. He would score, but was it down to a lack of confidence?",
      "It later emerged that Sesko, who admittedly has an impressive record from the penalty spot, was struggling with cramp, having played the full 90 minutes that evening. It was the striker’s first full 90' in a competitive game since April 19, but sources close to the player have insisted he wanted to take one. United's coaching staff decided he shouldn't.",
      "United have seen a number of expensive investments in front men fail to pay off in recent times - some more costly than others. Rasmus Hojlund joined in a £72m deal two years ago and is now poised for a loan exit to Napoli.",
      "Sesko needs to be a success and will need to find top gear to do so. But he can't do that unless the handbrake is taken off.",

      "The Red Devils had thrown away the lead twice at Old Trafford, as Burnley looked on course to come away a 2-2 draw. But when Jaidon Anthony pulled Amad's shirt inside the penalty area deep into stoppage time, referee Sam Barrott was instructed to go over to the pitch-side monitor.",
      "After a lengthy check, Barrott pointed to the spot and Fernandes grabbed the ball. Only last Sunday, the 30-year-old blazed a penalty over the crossbar during the Red Devils' deflating 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "Although he'd scored twice in the midweek penalty shootout against Grimsby Town, Fernandes still had unfinished business from the spot. And he did, burying his shot past Burnley goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who'd guessed right but couldn't keep it out of the net.",
      "While drama was unfolding, Amorim couldn't watch and rested his legs on the dugout. When the ball hit the back of the net, the United manager wasn't celebrating like the rest of Old Trafford but rather keeping a composed figure.",
      "On why he didn't watch the penalty, Amorim explained to Premier League Productions: \"I like to see the image of the fans. What has to be has to be. In that moment, I was thinking, it would be fair to win the game. And I did not think Bruno would miss a second in a row.\"",
      "The Portuguese coach was then asked if he was thinking of his future as Red Devils boss when Fernandes stepped up. \"No, I was just thinking Bruno was not going to miss,\" Amorim replied.",

      "On the game itself, which had plenty of pros and cons for Amorim to consider, he said: \"It is three points, if you look at the game we should solve it in the first half and control the game - but we are fighting to the last minute because of things we overcomplicate.",
      "\"Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score. You feel you can control the game. But one throw in, one set piece. I shook my head, because sometimes football is like this. We now have two weeks with a lot of opportunities. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do.\"",

      "Premier League fans have slammed VAR for ‘killing the game’ following controversy between Manchester United and Burnley. The Red Devils looked to be on the way to extending their winless start to the season - only for Bruno Fernandes to notch a 97th minute winner from the penalty spot after VAR intervention.",
      "With the scores level at 2-2 and United running out of time, they were given a golden chance to win the game after Amad was hauled down by Jaidon Anthony as he attempted to run through. The referee was sent to the VAR monitor and decided that the foul continued to take place inside the box - then duly pointed to the spot.",
      "But supporters were not convinced that was the right decision. Taking to Twitter, one fan said: “Only Man Utd could get a penalty for a shirt pull OUTSIDE the box. Another win for VAR.” Another added: “How can that be a penalty? It’s a freekick since it happened outside the box. VAR helps Man Utd today.”",
      "United captain Fernandes eventually tucked home the resulting spot-kick in the 97th minute of the game. But criticism for the decision continued to come.",
      "A fan responded: “Burnley have been robbed here. VAR is killing the game,” while a further supporter wrote: “VAR is having a nightmare weekend so far. Again, they’ve manufactured a win out of nowhere for Man United there.”",
      "And while fans were critical of the decision, ex-Liverpool star Stephen Warnock claimed that it was the right one. He said: “Penalty. Anthony switches off for a second and it's a little one two around him from Amad. The shirt pull starts outside the box but continues inside. It's panic more than anything.”",
      "Speaking after Fernandes had found the net, he added: “It's a get out of jail card for United. They have been poor in the second half and Burnley have been the better side and looked very comfortable. That is a moment that could change United's season and give them that bit of momentum.”",
      "The late penalty wasn’t the only moment of controversy at Old Trafford throughout what was a thrilling afternoon. United thought they had a penalty early on for Kyle Walker’s foul on Mason Mount but upon review, that decision was overturned.",
      "Elsewhere, Burnley thought they had scored through Lyle Foster immediately after United had taken a 2-1 lead but that goal was chalked off due to a tight offside call.",
      "United’s late win leaves them ninth in the Premier League heading into the international break, while Burnley are just two places below them.",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored a 97th-minute penalty to give Manchester United their first win of the season and ease the pressure on Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils, who came into Saturday's Premier League clash with Burnley off the back of their midweek humiliation in Grimsby, were pegged back twice by the visitors but snatched a 3-2 victory at the death.",
      "The game got off to a controversial start, as United's dominant play led to a penalty - or so they thought. Following a VAR review, Sam Barrott overturned his original decision to give a foul on Mason Mount by Kyle Walker.",
      "United decided to take matters into their own hands but they needed a stroke of luck to take the lead. Josh Cullen's own goal made it 1-0 before half-time but there was a momentum swing at the start of the second half, as Burnley came out of the blocks firing and equalised through Lyle Foster.",
      "Scott Parker's team were only level for 11 seconds, as Bryan Mbeumo put Amorim's side back ahead. Burnley didn't let their heads drop, though, and equalised once again through Jaidon Anthony.",
      "But Anthony would soon be the villain, as his 'sustained' holding of Amad's shirt just inside the box in stoppage time led to another a lengthy VAR check. This time, a penalty was given and Fernandes made up for last weekend's miss at Fulham.",
      "Here are six talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "When he most needed it, looked like Ruben Amorim had been given the dream start by his players. United were purring in the opening stages, as Leny Yoro forced a save from Martin Dubravka before Bryan Mbeumo went close on two occasions.",
      "Then a mistake from Kyle Walker gave Mason Mount a sniff and the United No.7 drove towards the penalty area. The pair made contact and Mount went bundling down, resulting in referee Sam Barrott awarding United a penalty.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had the ball in hands, ready to make amends. A VAR check was taking place for what most of the stadium believed to be in order to determine whether or not the foul took place inside the 18-yard box.",
      "But there was no foul after all. Barrott was sent to the pitch-side monitor and overturned his decision, telling Old Trafford that Walker hadn't committed any offence, as a drop ball was awarded to restart play.",
      "Sometimes, you need a bit of fortune. But given their dominant start, United will argue that they made their own luck for when Josh Cullen's own goal broke the deadlock on 27 minutes.",
      "Casemiro rose highest at a free-kick and after his header cannoned back off the crossbar, the ball hit the helpless Cullen, firing it back towards goal. Dubravka did his best to keep the ball out but Barrott's watch indicated that it had indeed gone over the line, sending the Stretford End into jubliation.",
      "Just as things were looking up, the Red Devils lost one of their summer signings through injury. Matheus Cunha went down in serious discomfort, seemingly in his right hamstring.",
      "The Brazilian forward couldn't continue and hobbled off, putting his participation for Brazil during the international break into deep jeopardy. Fellow new signing Benjamin Sesko was expected to replace Cunha but Amorim opted to give Joshua Zirkzee his first minutes of the Premier League campaign, a decision which raised eyebrows.",
      "At half-time, another potential injury blow emerged. Mount was withdraw and still Sesko wasn't the man, as Kobbie Mainoo - amid intense speculation over his future - entered the fray for the second half.",
      "Burnley started the better in what turned out to be a goal-fest of a second half, troubling United and gaining much more territory than they had done in the second half. And the equaliser didn't take long.",
      "Scott Parker's men were rightly growing in confidence and knew that United would give them a chance. The Red Devils' defence was all jumbled up in the 54th minute to allow Jacob Bruun Larsen space on the left flank.",
      "Diogo Dalot rushed out but he was too late, allowing Bruun Larsen's cross to be met by Lyle Foster, who finished past Altay Bayindir. Burnley had drawn level but the parity would only last 11 seconds.",
      "A long ball from Bayindir after kick-off found Zirkzee, who headed on for Dalot to collect. The United wing-back looked to his right and there was Mbeumo, who'd put the brakes on earlier than Burnley's defence to give himself space.",
      "For his second goal in four days, the £71million forward blasted home and the Clarets were once again behind. On the touchline, Amorim shook his head in disbelief.",
      "For Amorim, the head shaking wasn't over. Instead of being rocked by United's second goal, Burnley got back on the horse and pulled themselves level within nine minutes.",
      "Jaidon Anthony was the goalscorer, having been Jonny on the spot to Bayindir's parry from a Loum Tchaouna shot. But the root cause of the goal was Walker's long throw-in which was flicked on twice.",
      "The Red Devils' woes from set pieces and throw-ins are clear to see. Having replaced Andre Onana from the midweek cup exit, there'll also be questions of Bayindir's role amid United's pursuit of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "After being denied the chance to make up for last Sunday's miss earlier in the game, Fernandes was given one at the death in dramatic circumstances. In the seventh minute of stoppage time, after a long, long wait, the man who blazed his effort high over the bar at Craven Cottage didn't miss again.",
      "A wave of relief rushed over Old Trafford - everywhere but from the devastated away section. Their performance left much to be desired but United have finally found a way to win.",
      "There's work to do for Amorim both during and after the international break. As for Burnley, it was a cruel ending to an afternoon full of resilience.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim could only shake his head as Old Trafford celebrated Manchester United's second goal against Burnley - scored by new signing Bryan Mbeumo - before Bruno Fernandes' 97th minute penalty rescued three points.",
      "The Brentford man ended a wait of almost four hours when he put the Red Devils ahead - which was the first Premier League goal scored by a United player this term after they were gifted own goals in the opening games of the season. Mbeumo's strike came just seconds after Burnley had drawn themselves left - putting the hosts 2-1 up - but whilst the majority of the stadium jumped up to celebrate Amorim could only turn and shake his head, his frustrations clear for all to see.",
      "United's lead did not last long as the Premier League new boys equalised for a second time. The game looked set to end in a stalemate before VAR intervened to give the hosts a penalty, hammered home by Fernandes in stoppage time.",
      "Amorim's side had picked up just one point from their opening two league games and were also dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby in midweek - making their late show against Burnley all the more vital.",
      "Pressure has ramped up on the Portuguese boss who has struggled for answers in his 10 month tenure thus far. Despite spending more than £200million in the summer United have shown few improvements this term. Their most expensive recruit, Benjamin Sesko, was left on the bench for the third straight league game despite costing £74milllion. He was tipped to lead the team's line but has not had the desired impact and was criticised in midweek for taking the 10th penalty at Blundell Park.",
      "In what was potentially a telling call, Amorim chose to bring on the unconvincing Joshua Zirkzee in the first-half when Matheus Cunha was forced off injured. In doing so he overlooked Sesko, who remained sat on the bench until the 72nd minute, but he struggled to make much of an impact during his brief cameo.",
      "Amorim was again apologetic for Wednesday's embarrassing cup exit at the hands of the League Two outfit as he said in his programme notes: “Good afternoon and welcome back to Old Trafford. Today, as we welcome Scott Parker and his Burnley side, we need to give a response after Wednesday night’s cup fixture.",
      "\"I can only say to our supporters that I am sorry. The better team on the night won the game and both what we showed, everybody has to do better. Today, we have to show intensity from the start. We need to go out onto the pitch and show how we are capable of playing, because the only way we fix this is by winning games.\"",

      "Joshua King thought he'd put the visitors ahead in the second-half before those celebrations were cut short. Rodrigo Muniz was deemed to have fouled Trevoh Chalobah as he tried to turn the Chelsea defender near the halfway line.",
      "The decision stunned plenty of onlookers with the Fulham star seemingly doing little wrong, leaving Marco Silva fuming. He attempted to confront referee Rob Jones before being waved away as his side were left to digest a difficult decision and result.",
      "The incident has drawn huge parallels to a penalty awarded to Manchester United at Aston Villa back in 2020. Bruno Fernandes, the man in possession, tried to turn Ezri Konsa, before placing his boot on the Villa man as he went down.",
      "On that occasion it was the United man who was awarded the penalty, much to the frustration of then Villa boss Dean Smith. So whilst the man in possession five years ago was awarded a penalty, now Muniz has been penalised and the lack of consistency is called out.",
      "Jones, the referee at Stamford Bridge, explained his decision after taking a look at the monitor and said: \"After review, the Fulham number nine commits a careless challenge, stands on the foot of the Chelsea defender, therefore we disallow the goal and we restart with a Chelsea free-kick.\"",
      "\"And I want to be on the bench in the next game, I don't want to pay fines, I want to help our players. But it has been difficult for us, this start of the season, with so many decisions that haven't come in the way they should.\"",
      "Rewind five years and Smith was equally fuming that his Villa side saw a penalty given against them. Referee Jon Moss gave the spot-kick and his decision was backed up by VAR official Graham Scott before the manager let rip.",
      "He said: \"I can understand Jon (Moss, referee) getting it wrong but I don't know what VAR are looking at - it's a disgraceful decision. They have a screen they can go and look at it but they don't seem to be bothered. Fernandes is trying a double drag back - his first touch is on the ball his second touch is on Ezri Konsa's shin. I won't tell you what I think...\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side had taken a solitary point from their opening two Premier League games, with the United boss admitting before the Burnley clash that only a win would do. United led 1-0 at half-time, thanks to an own goal from Burnley's Josh Cullen.",
      "Here are how United's players rated in the first-half:",
      "Bayindir: Got the nod to start over Andre Onana and acquitted himself well. Assured with his feet when he needed to be and remained calm under pressure, although was hardly troubled. 6",
      "Yoro: Went close with a header early on and headed over midway through the first-half. Compsoed in defence and an aerial threat from set-pieces. 6",
      "De Ligt: Solid defensively and did enough to put Hannibal Mejbri off in the 37th minute, forcing the former United player to blaze a shot over he bar from close-range. 6",
      "Shaw: Got forward at the start of the first-half but was forced into more of a defensive role as the game went on. Looked sharp and alert, after last season's injury nightmare. 6",
      "Amad: Drew several fouls in the early stages and was frustrated none were punished with a caution. Linked up well with Mbeumo down the right side and saw a goalbound effort deflected over. 6",
      "Casemiro: Took the ball full in the face early on but recovered and played a key role in the opener, his header coming off the crossbar before cannoning back over the line off Josh Cullen. 7",
      "Fernandes: Still doesn't look as effective deployed in a deeper midfield role. But United scored the opener from his free-kick delivery and he played with his customary zeal. 7",
      "Dalot: Won the free-kick that led to United's opener, after out-pacing Kyle Walker to the ball and forcing the veteran defender into conceding a foul. 6",
      "Mount: Got involved in a spat with Walker. Won a penalty after a tussle with Walker but the decision was overturned. Impressive industry and passing range. Clipped bar with a header. 7",
      "Mbeumo: Twice went close to scoring in the early stages of the first-half, forcing a fine save from Dubravka with a curling left-foot shot and then firing just wide with an angled effort. 7",
      "Cunha: Made an impressive driving run towards the edge of the Burnley area early on, but shot straight at Dubravka. Was forced off with an injury after half-an-hour. 7",
      "Sub: Zirkzee (Cunha, 31): Made an impact straight away and caused problems for Burnley's defence.",

      "His exit appeared to catch United boss Ruben Amorim off guard, as the home side didn't have a substitute ready to replace the former Wolves forward. Eventually, Joshua Zirkzee entered the fray.",

      "He made a bit of a breakthrough in 2019 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, following several loan spells. Despite signing a fresh four-year contract, he was loaned out to Lazio in 2020 and then to Flamengo the next season. With his game time in Manchester dwindling, Pereira permanently moved to Fulham in 2022 for a reported fee of £10m, with a 20 per cent sell-on clause included in his contract.",
      "After three years at the Cottagers, where he became an integral part of Marco Silva's team, Pereira is returning to Brazil. However, any hopes the Red Devils had of pocketing 20 per cent of any profit from his sale have been dashed, as Pereira has reportedly been sold for £10m once again.",
      "The 29-year-old had one year left on his Fulham contract. As Fulham didn't profit from this sale, United will not receive any windfall. Pereira's departure paves the way for young star Josh King, who has been starting as the No. 10 for the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Upon departing England, Pereira said: \"From the first day at Fulham, I felt at home. Thank you to my teammates, staff, and fans for every moment. After three years, I leave proud of what we achieved together. Fulham will always be part of me.\"",
      "Yet his recollections of his stint at Old Trafford may not be quite so cherished, as he made abundantly clear to Rio Ferdinand during a conversation last year.",
      "The Brazilian departed just as Erik ten Hag arrived, having swiftly recognised he wasn't included in the Dutchman's blueprint, and chose not to remain to discover whether his circumstances might improve.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, Pereira revealed: \"This was when I came back to England [after my loan to Flamengo]. Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old,\" he continued, referencing the period he spent within the Dutch club's academy system.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team.' But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United.'",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik [in 2022] because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here.'",
      "\"'You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad.' That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "He further stated: \"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave.\"",
      "During his tenure at the club, the Brazilian made a total of 75 appearances for United, netting four goals and providing five assists.",

      "\"That was a big win for Burnley last week. Even at this early stage, it’s important for a newly promoted side to get off the board with a win. This could be a nervy day at Old Trafford but I do think United will narrowly get the win.",
      "\"One to watch- Bruno Fernandes had a strange game at Fulham last week. Rightly or sometimes wrongly, he’s always one to watch!\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he felt someone else should be in the United dugout ahead of this weekend. The 40-year-old is simply happy to have an opportunity to get over his team's latest defeat.",
      "“I felt that after the game, I don’t feel that now,\" he said. \"It’s a little bit like that. I think that’s the hardest part of the defeat - sometimes it’s not the result, it’s the way we lost or drew that game.",
      "\"That is the thing that’s hard to accept, because we can do better. It’s the small things: recovery positions, fight for the ball, running, all these small things. Sometimes, we dropped a little bit the level. The good thing is that we now have the next game to put that level up and that is the focus.”",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been urged to turn to Wayne Rooney to help him get the best out of Benjamin Sesko. £74m striker Sesko has yet to score in one start and two substitute outings for his new club, and was questioned by some for only taking the 10th penalty in Wednesday's Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "While it's still very early in Sesko's United career, and there have been suggestions cramp was a factor in the penalty decision, all is not right at Old Trafford in a wider sense. Amorim cast doubt on his own future after the cup humiliation, with the Red Devils missing out on Europe last season and yet to win a match this term.",
      "Now, former Premier League striker Troy Deeney has encouraged the former Sporting CP boss to call on club legend Rooney for some assistance. Rooney's son Kai is already on United's books, and Deeney believes there could be a benefit to bringing the former England frontman into the fold.",
      "\"No one is saying Sesko is no good and needs to learn the basics — but there are nuances to playing for such a big club,\" Deeney wrote for The Sun. \"Wayne Rooney lives near Carrington. He is there a lot with his son in the academy, why not ask for his help?",
      "\"It comes down to whether Amorim has that sort of humility to go and ask Rooney. He could speak to Sesko about how he dealt with moving from Everton to United, his home life, whether he needs help booking restaurants with a bit of privacy. You could even get Rooney to take a few practices with the forwards, even if it is just for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Deeney made reference to a similar situation during his early years at Watford. Sean Dyche, the Hornets' manager at the time, brought in former United and England star Teddy Sheringham to run the forwards through training drills, and the impact soon emerged.",
      "Dyche left at the end of that 2011-12 season, but Watford went on to finish the following campaign as the top scorers in the Championship with 85 goals. Deeney scored 19 of those 85, and would score even more in each of the next two campaigns as the team eventually won promotion to the top flight.",
      "United came back from 2-0 down to force penalties against Grimsby, but no member of Amorim's squad managed to find the net in either of the first two Premier League games. The Red Devils drew a blank at home to Arsenal, while Rodrigo Muniz's own goal helped them earn a point away at Fulham.",
      "Next up is a home game against Burnley, with pressure mounting on Amorim, and the head coach has opened up on the frustrations he voiced after the midweek loss. \"In that moment, I was really upset and really disappointed, because I felt like we had a good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played,\" he told reporters.",
      "\"We played badly [for] 30 minutes against Fulham, and then that kind of performance [at Grimsby], I was really disappointed with everything. But now, it’s a new game and I’m focused on the next game.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim is looking to bounce back from the brink as his Manchester United side take on Burnley in what's shaping up to be a must-win game for the Red Devils. On Wednesday, United suffered a humiliating exit from the EFL Cup at the hands of League 2 outfit Grimsby Town, losing a tense penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw in normal time.",
      "They are still looking for their first win of the season after losing to Arsenal on the opening day and drawing with Fulham last week. Burnley, in contrast, are in fine form and aiming to make it three wins on the bounce after beating fellow promoted side Sunderland before knocking Derby out of the EFL Cup in midweek.",
      "The match will take place at Old Trafford on Saturday, August 30. Kick off is at 3pm.",
      "Unfortunately for UK viewers, the match will not be broadcast live. This is because of the long-standing 3pm blackout rule, which has been in place since the 1960s.",
      "Under this regulation, football matches scheduled between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on Saturdays are not permitted to be shown live on UK TV. The rule was originally introduced to protect match attendances, encouraging fans to attend games in person rather than watching from home.",
      "It applies across all professional leagues, including the Premier League, the English Football League, and lower-tier competitions, and has remained largely unchanged despite the growth of broadcasting and streaming.",
      "While some exceptions exist - for example, matches played on public holidays or certain cup fixtures - the 3pm blackout continues to be a unique feature of English football, shaping how fans experience the sport each weekend.",
      "The longstanding 3pm blackout rule was temporarily lifted at the start of the EFL season due to the staggered scheduling of fixtures, with multiple matches on August 2 being televised live.",
      "League 1 and League 2 kicked off in early August, with the Championship following a week later on August 7, and the Premier League starting on August 15. This staggered start created a unique situation under UEFA's regulations: the 3pm blackout applies only when at least 50 per cent of matches in the top two divisions kick off at 3pm on a Saturday.",
      "However, this weekend the blackout is back in full effect, meaning United and Burnley fans will once again need to attend in person to catch the action live.",
      "Midweek matches as well as Friday and Monday night football will all be covered under this new deal, giving fans the chance to tune into even more games than ever before.",
      "Sky Group CEO Dana Strong shared her excitement at the news when it was announced, adding: \"This is a fantastic result for Sky customers, who will see a significant increase in the number of matches from the most iconic league in the world. Sky is the undisputed home for sport fans in the UK.\"",
      "So, these are the remaining games available to watch on TV in the UK over the opening weekend as the new Premier League season gets underway:",

A further £2.6m was set to be payable in add-ons with United set to take a £60m loss on the former Ajax ace, but the club stood to gain 50 percent of any profit that Betis made in any future sale of the 25-year-old.",
      "Despite that, issues remained. Antony has two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford and carries a significant salary that he does not want to lose. Neither Betis or United were willing to make up the difference and Antony is believed to be unwilling to waive what he stands to make.",

      "The Slovenia striker did come on in the second period, replacing Casemiro with just under 20 minutes remaining. Amorim's handling of Sesko has also been a talking point this season. United paid big money to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig, but the striker has yet to start in a Premier League fixture.",

      "Amorim continued: \"When they [the players] put the effort, I will always love them. I think we need to understand that we should always be on this level of effort.",
      "\"Because even in the game, we played well at the beginning and then struggled when we changed the characteristics of the players because the match was not so perfect.",
      "\"And you can feel the team struggle a little bit, especially in the second half, but the effort was always there and we tried to put the ball in the box. We tried to put more people in the box, not just around the box to play the ball.",
      "\"Some of the things that we worked on and spoke about during the week were that they were doing that and focused on the game, which is the most important thing.\"",
      "United will take on Manchester City when the Premier League resumes after the international break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "body": [
      "A banner unfurled in the Stretford End before kick-off read, 'The good days are coming'. This was one of them for Manchester United.",
      "Undone by a penalty in midweek, United were spot on this time. It was the fourth spot kick Bruno Fernandes had taken within seven days and this was one of the biggest pressure-penalties he will have ever converted.",
      "After the Video Assistant Referee denied United a spot kick in the first half, it offered them deliverance in added time.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee fetched the ball while the check was ongoing. Fernandes accepted the ball calmly and paced around the penalty area, determined that his routine not be upset, as it was at Fulham. Amid the din at its award, Zirkzee urged the crowd to remain calm when all they could chant was \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\".. They then chanted it again, only euphorically.",
      "This time, United defended their one-goal advantage. Diogo Dalot brazenly over celebrated a goal kick. Fernandes did likewise and barged into an appalled Lyle Foster.",
      "It should not have been this taxing. United were so dominant against promoted Burnley that they racked up 20 more shots. Burnley scored twice from their six efforts.",
      "As much as United attempted to avoid the unnecessary drama, the nervy manner of victory could lift them when their season resumes with the derby in a fortnight.",
      "Eerie parallels were developing with the last season United had no European football 11 years ago. They had lost their opening home game, drawn their first away match and gone out of the League Cup in the second round. They were minutes away from drawing with Burnley in their fourth fixture.",
      "While United are busy attempting to shift their Jadon and Antony before Monday's transfer deadline, they will be grateful to Jaidon Anthony of Burnley. His tug on Amad was retrospectively deemed to warrant a penalty.",
      "Bar the win, this season still feels like an extension of last. United's goalkeeper is dropping dollies and the forwards' conversion rate has barely improved. Unlike against Arsenal, plenty of supporters headed down the gangways to make an early exit long before full-time. They should know better.",
      "It is a quirk of this new United that they are at their most enterprising without a striker on, yet still hardly ever score. For the second week running, an own goal put them ahead and Bryan Mbeumo's strike is their only goal from open play in four-and-a-half hours in the Premier League.",
      "The United chief executive, Omar Berrada, looked agitated as the clock ticked towards the 90-minute mark. Ruben Amorim appeared permanently dissatisfied as attempt after attempt hit anything but the back of the net.",
      "Amorim admitted on Friday that he sometimes \"hates\" his players. He must have done so at times again. He suggested United players dwell on the past too much. Even their worst side in 51 years serves up late finales.",
      "When United regained the lead through Mbeumo for 2-1, Amorim shook his head while all those around him celebrated, clearly disgruntled that United were only that ruthless following Burnley's equaliser.",
      "As Amorim waited in the tunnel before kick-off, the Stretford End broke into a chorus of his chant. It was conspicuous by its absence at Grimsby yet returned loudly. The aforementioned banner bore the silhouette of Amorim.",
      "The hosts ought to have been out of sight by the time they returned indoors for the half-time oranges. Pleasingly for United's deal-makers, Mbeumo, bought to sharpen the attack, was clinical.",
      "For Mbeumo, it was the desired response to his costly penalty miss at Grimsby on Wednesday night. He has otherwise had an auspicious start at United, creating and scoring chances.",
      "Amorim donned a bomber jacket but there will not be any artillery to shield from over the international fortnight. He refused to promise he would be in charge next month but it seems a safer bet than to lump money on his removal.",
      "Not only was this a good day but United were good to watch. Particularly in the first half. Burnley have quickly learnt that their miserly defensive record last year counts for nought.",
      "Altay Bayindir was back between the posts and culpable for another goal. Four of the six United have shipped this month have been 'keeper errors. It remains possible that that department will not be strengthened before 7pm on Monday.",
      "Ironically, Burnley had more hassle at corners. Casemiro and Mason Mount struck the crossbar while Fernandes and Amad almost recreated David Beckham and Paul Scholes's corner routine at Bradford City 25 years ago.",
      "United's flow was interrupted by the premature withdrawal of the hamstrung Matheus Cunha on 30 minutes. United physio Jordan Reece offered Cunha a consolatory pat as he headed down the tunnel.",
      "That was compounded by the removal of the influential Mount at the pause. Last August, Mount excelled in the first half at Brighton, went off injured at the interval and never truly recovered over the course of the season. He has sustained an injury in August in each of his three seasons with United.",
      "With Cunha out of sight, Amorim was still mulling over his replacement. He consulted his staff before instructing assistant Carlos Fernandes to summon Zirkzee, rather than Benjamin Sesko.",
      "As damningly as that reflected on Sesko, United had been fluid and threatening with three No.10s up front. Amorim considers Zirkzee to be of that ilk and the Dutchman offered some silky touches.",
      "Still, this was Zirkzee's first Premier League appearance since April 13 and Sesko had at least an hour across the Arsenal and Fulham matches. Sesko was not needed until Anthony equalised.",
      "New season, new guidelines but the same unfathomable officials. The one indisputable issue with Mount's first-half tangle with Kyle Walker on the edge of the area seemed to be that a foul had been committed. Not for the Video Assistant Referee, who recommended a review. On-pitch referee Sam Barrott decided one had not been.",
      "Diogo Dalot had handed the ball to Fernandes upon the initial award of a penalty. Fernandes then headed over to where Mount was supposedly felled to take a free kick. He got neither.",
      "He did in Fergie time.",

      "Altay Bayindir returned to the team to face Burnley after Andre Onana's recall against Grimsby, but Bayindir was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal in the 66th minute to make it 2-2.",
      "The Turkey international was unable to push a save wide and Anthony took advantage. Amorim has watched his goalkeepers make mistakes against Arsenal, Grimsby and Burnley this term, but defended his 'keepers after the win over the Clarets, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side.",
      "\"Guys, they are humans,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",
      "Amorim said he was pleased with United's response to the Grimsby debacle and praised Bryan Mbeumo's contribution: \"It was impressive, the way he (Mbeumo) stretched the team, the quality he has in the first touch.",
      "\"You can feel that we are a different team, because when we win the ball, we have one guy stretching the team. Last season we struggled a little bit with that.",
      "\"And then you can see the first minutes of the game. You can understand, you can compare this to Wednesday, and you can feel it. It's not about playing well.",
      "\"The sound of the fans when we are pressing and winning balls and corners, and you sprint to get a corner, you sprint to get a throw in, it's nothing to do with the tactical and technical aspects. So today, I just need to watch sometimes the first minutes to understand the mindset of the team.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"The important thing is that if you take Wednesday, we were more consistent in the performance compared to last year. That is a good thing. But I'm not thinking about turning point.",
      "\"I had this conversation with you guys like 10 times. So I'm not, it's day by day. I'm happy. We return, sometimes playing well or not so well.",
      "\"We return a little bit to think that we should be competitive, creating chances, we need to score. Sometimes we block the opponent in their half, we press really high. So we have a lot to do, but we return a little bit to our level today.\"",

      "Manchester United won 3-2 against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim was placed under huge pressure after losing to Grimsby Town earlier in the week, and knew he needed to secure a win against the Clarets ahead of the international break.",
      "Burnley thought they would leave Old Trafford with a point having twice equalised, but Amad was brought down in added time to win a penalty. Bruno Fernandes converted and Old Trafford breathed a sigh of relief at the whistle.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the game. Banners and flags were unfurled, and one flag had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction after Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the text. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around,\" to the tune of Bonnie Tyler.",
      "Amorim sounded like he was close to tendering his resignation after the Grimsby defeat. Some fans voiced understandable concerns about the 40-year-old, but he still retains support from matchgoing fans.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee quickly picked up the ball while VAR decided whether to award a late penalty to United. The Dutchman handed it over to Fernandes, who paced around the box as he tried to focus his mind.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham last weekend and atoned for that miss to secure an important three points. It was only a win against Burnley, but it was crucial after the Grimsby debacle.",
      "United's captain screamed in relief at full-time and was embraced by Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had enough chances to put the result beyond doubt in the first half. But they never make it easy for themselves and could not extend their advantage.",
      "Burnley equalised in the 55th minute, but Mbeumo produced an immediate response to score his first goal for United. Mbeumo was mobbed by his attacking colleagues, while Amorim did not raise a smile. He knew there was more work to do and buried his head in his hands shortly afterwards when Fernandes dragged a shot wide.",
      "United's head coach knew his side needed a two-goal lead because, more often than not, they allow their opponent back into the contest. And Amorim's fears were realised when Jaidon Anthony scored to make it 2-2.",
      "The cameras in the press box showed Omar Berrada looking unhappy in the directors' box. Amorim subsequently blew out his cheeks and could hardly watch as Fernandes stepped up to convert a late penalty.",
      "Shortly after United opened the scoring against Burnley, Cunha went down with an injury.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee were sent to warm up. Cunha returned to the dressing room with what seemed to be a hamstring issue and was consoled by the substitutes at the tunnel entrance.",
      "Cunha was applauded by supporters as he headed down the tunnel and his body language hinted he might be out for several weeks, which would be a huge blow for United.",
      "The Brazilian has made a strong impression since signing from Wolves. It felt like only a matter of time before Cunha would score his first United goal, but it seems he will be unavailable in the coming weeks.",
      "Mount had a brilliant five minutes in the first half. He tracked back to recover the ball to create a chance for Mbeumo and did the same moments later when setting up the Cameroon international again.",
      "Mbeumo came close to scoring on both occasions but could not find the back of the net, so Mount took matters into his own hands minutes later and made a piercing run into the Burnley penalty area.",
      "Kyle Walker appeared to bring Mount to the ground and the referee pointed for a penalty. Mount celebrated winning the spot kick to the Stretford End, but his celebrations were premature.",
      "The incident was reviewed by VAR. The referee announced it was not a foul when the presumption was it had been reviewed to determine whether it was a penalty or a free-kick. It was a bizarre decision from VAR and Mount deserved something for his good work.",
      "Mount was excellent in the first half but was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval. Mount must have picked up an injury because, based on his performance, Amorim wouldn't have brought him off.",
      "Mainoo's future has made headlines this week. The youngster's contract situation has stalled and there are doubts about where he fits into Amorim's system, so it's not a surprise that he wants to leave on loan.",
      "The academy graduate wants minutes and Amorim has said he is challenging Fernandes for a place in the starting team. Fans are concerned that Mainoo could eventually leave on a permanent basis and Old Trafford gave a deliberately loud cheer for the 20-year-old when he was introduced.",

      "An uplifting pre-season campaign was followed by a decent showing against Arsenal, albeit one that ended in defeat, but the wheels came off, and Ruben Amorim needed to win against Burnley.",
      "United surrendered a one-goal lead against Fulham last weekend and were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby Town on Wednesday, so the pressure was building.",
      "Thankfully, Bruno Fernandes converted a late penalty to secure a much-needed victory for United ahead of the international break. Amorim looked relieved at full-time and will now benefit from a break.",

      "The Brazilian was replaced by Joshua Zirkzee before heading straight down the tunnel.",
      "Speaking after the final whistle, Amorim admitted his concern at the forward's injury. \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" the United head coach said.",

      "A video surfaced online of the forward looking fine and smiling to fans as he made his way out of the car park.",

      "Ruben Amorim has refused to promise that he will remain in charge of Manchester United after the September international break.",
      "League Two Grimsby Town eliminated United from the League Cup 12-11 in a penalty shootout on Wednesday night, having led 2-0 until the 75th minute in the 2-2 draw. That prompted an emotional post-match assessment from Amorim, who admitted \"something has to change\".",
      "United host Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday before the first round of internationals this season and resume their campaign against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on September 14.",
      "Amorim said at his pre-match press conference that \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\", a comment that United sources claimed was tongue in cheek and a rationale for his emotional nature after matches.",
      "The United head coach is expected to hold further discussions with members of the club's leadership team during the internationals. United usually start planning for the summer transfer window the following year in September.",
      "Amorim said during pre-season that to \"walk away is more an ego thing\". When asked if he can say with absolute certainty that he will be the United manager after the international break, Amorim replied: \"I don't know what is going to happen. That is my idea [to stay], but again, I am not going to promise you nothing, what is going to be the future.",
      "\"But I'm the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change. I said that sometimes there is an ego thing, I don't say that I will put my ego to a part, or in front. You were there, and you understand.",
      "\"Guys, I'm being honest with you, sometimes I'm so frustrated with the team that I think in one thing, and then I return to my normal behaviour! So I will not promise you that.",
      "\"I will live this day by day, so I'm tired of saying that I'm not going to behave like this or that. I'm going to be myself and I have a lot of passion and I want to succeed more than anyone.\"",
      "Amorim stressed he remains confident that he is the right man to make United a credible force again but that he was \"shocked\" by the level of performance at Blundell Park.",
      "\"Yes (I am confident). It depends on the day!\" he laughed. \"But I'm confident because I saw these players play really well in tough matches and I see it in training, the training is so much better.",
      "\"I was not surprised, I was shocked in the last game, I was shocked. That's why you see that game, this is not our team, the way we are doing things.",
      "\"So I'm always confident in the way I manage the team. And then I'm trying to remind myself if Bruno (Fernandes) scores that penalty (at Fulham), if we have three first opportunities against Fulham, we score a goal. Things will be really different.",
      "\"And sometimes it's that small difference that changes the narrative and you can see it in one week, it looks like a different club.",
      "\"There's no excuse (for the Grimsby debacle), because I didn't put just 11 players that don't play so much, they played in pre-season, it was not just guys that are from the academy, a mix, no, it was in the right position.",
      "\"I could play that team the next game. We had Kobbie (Mainoo), Manu (Ugarte), Harry Maguire, (Matheus) Cunha, (Benjamin) Sesko, Amad, Diogo (Dalot), Patrick (Dorgu). So that is the frustration of a coach, so that's why it's hard.",
      "\"I don't know what happened, but in the normal day, so much better.\"",
      "Amorim was in a jocular mood at his pre-match press conference, despite the humiliation at Grimsby. He admitted sometimes \"I just need 10 minutes with myself alone\" to talk him out of quitting.",
      "\"I don't need anyone, but I'm going to be like that. When you say I want to quit, it's that, 'f*****g, I want to quit, I don't love the players'. I hate sometimes my kids, so I'm going to be like that! That is not going to change.",
      "\"Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a funny thing, I'm going to suffer. We just need to win some games. So we cannot change that fact. We need to focus on the next game, and if we start winning, things are going to be easier to do.\"",

      "Manchester United could leave themselves open to further transfer humiliation if they decide to sell Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho this weekend. And it may leave more openings for Erik ten Hag to be proved correct yet again, almost a year on from his Old Trafford exit.",
      "A pattern has emerged at United in recent years, whereby players who couldn't thrive for them have been loaned or sold only to impress elsewhere. Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa) and Antony (Real Betis) each enjoyed resurgences on loan at other clubs last season, while Anthony Elanga, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alvaro Carreras have undergone similar transformations after being sold.",
      "But no example appears more wasteful than Scott McTominay, who was named Serie A Player of the Year after helping guide Napoli to the league title in his first season after leaving United. In that sense, one can envision how other teams could get a stronger tune out of obvious young talents like Mainoo and Garnacho if they were to leave this summer.",
      "Ten Hag made it clear at the time of McTominay's move to Naples last summer that it was not his decision: \"I am a little mixed. I am very happy for him but I would prefer not to lose him because he was so important for our team.",
      "\"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales. Obviously, homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do, but for everyone, for all parts, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player, but also for us.\"",
      "Ten Hag, who gave Mainoo his first-team debut at United, poured praise upon the player in August 2024 when he hinted the youngster has what it takes to one day become a \"perfect midfielder.\" That was in reference to the player's ability to do well in all aspects of his midfield responsibilities.",
      "Once lauded as the greatest talent to come out of United's academy in some time, Mainoo suddenly finds himself on the fringes under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old hasn't played a minute in the Premier League so far this term and has reportedly requested a loan away, though United are understood to have swiftly rejected the idea.",
      "And while Garnacho's stock at Old Trafford has sunk as the player appears set for a move to Chelsea, he too was once lauded by his old boss. It was only 12 months ago Ten Hag spared no expense in putting Garnacho on a pedestal as one of United's biggest gems.",
      "The Dutchman was asked last summer whether the South American could break into the elite category and responded: \"A world-class player? He has to go a long way. He has high potential.",
      "\"He showed last season he can contribute and be a starting XI player. To make the jump and become a world-class player, it starts with very hard work. That brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being that world-class player. I agree he has the potential.\"",
      "Garnacho's demeanour is what appears to have landed him in Amorim's bad books ahead of what looks a likely move to west London. The Argentinian was made to train away from the squad in December 2024, around the same time he and his brother were implicated in a report suggesting someone within the squad was leaking team news.",
      "Over the past two seasons, captain Bruno Fernandes (34 goals) and striker Rasmus Hojlund (26) are the only United players to have outscored Garnacho (21). And for a team that's been lacking in the attacking department, it's easier to see why a rival would spot an opportunity in recruiting him.",
      "United were mocked by some fans for selling McTominay for less than £30million given what he went on to achieve so quickly in Italy. Mainoo may be kept around for the time being, but there's a real risk the £40m figure attached to 21-year-old Garnacho's name is a sign history could be set to repeat.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could be set for a Manchester United exit, with the Red Devils potentially losing a player Alejandro Garnacho once described as \"the best player in the squad.\"",
      "Whilst Garnacho's own future seems destined for elsewhere, with a switch to Chelsea looming, Mainoo could be set to join Serie A champions Napoli before Monday's transfer deadline as the midfielder pursues a move. Although the club are reluctant to sanction any move.",
      "The 20-year-old was previously regarded as a crucial element of United's long-term plans following his displays across the past two campaigns. The youngster accumulated a tally of spectacular strikes and secured his England bow just over 12 months ago.",
      "He also delivered a man of the match display in United's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City in 2024 after netting the decisive goal. It was following that encounter against City where Garnacho lavished his colleague with extraordinary acclaim.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, alongside Mainoo, Garnacho hailed the midfielder's pivotal role in securing the victory. \"Just incredible,\" Garnacho said of his team-mate.",
      "\"I always say, for me, he's the best player in the squad and he's the youngest. We are also very good friends so I am very happy for him\" When presenting the man of the match award to Mainoo, Garnacho added: \"My man, I love you.\"",
      "With a squad brimming with talent, it spoke volumes to Mainoo's ability, that at just 20, he was given such an accolade. The England midfielder’s club contract runs until 2027 at United but negotiations over an extension have stalled.",
      "The Mirror say the Italian champions have a four-year contract waiting for Mainoo, with the player having told United bosses he wants to go to Serie A, but on a permanent deal.",
      "However, United are understandably cautious, given the remarkable impact another former player, Scott McTominay, has had at Napoli, and have so far prevented Mainoo's transfer. They are believed to value him at £50million and are open to offers, however.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has only started 16 out of 44 games, and was benched for the second consecutive Premier League match this season when United drew 1-1 with Fulham on Sunday. Nonetheless, Mainoo played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "A video of a disheartened Mainoo at the final whistle at Fulham circulated on social media, fuelling rumours of his potential exit ahead of Monday's deadline.",
      "Meanwhile, United have agreed a £40m deal with Chelsea for Garnacho, after he fell out of favour with Amorim. The Red Devils have secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee after United stood their ground on their valuation of Garnacho, having turned down Chelsea's initial offer of £25m.",
      "Garnacho was omitted from United's starting line-up for their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and publicly criticised Amorim in the immediate aftermath of the loss in Bilbao.",
      "If Mainoo moves to Napoli, he will be aiming to replicate the success of McTominay. The Scotsman was permitted to leave Old Trafford last summer for Antonio Conte's side in a £25m deal.",
      "Since then, he has delivered a series of man of the match performances domestically and in Europe, becoming the first Scot to be shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or since former Rangers striker Ally McCoist in 1987.",

      "Following Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren's exploitation of Andre Onana's poor goalkeeping during the opening period, Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire struck after the interval to restore parity. Nevertheless, an epic penalty shoot-out resulted in Grimsby prevailing 12-11, triggering wild celebrations at Blundell Park.",
      "Following the match, Stockwood disclosed an entertaining conversation he'd had with a United official, which emphasised the vast disparity between the two clubs' statures. Speaking to the Athletic, Stockwood said: \"I'll tell you one funny quick thing.",
      "\"With Manchester United coming to town, they sent us almost a rider for the manager, and it was like, 'Where's the manager's changing room?' And I was like, 'F***ing hell, the manager's changing room?' For us, it is the back of his car. The manager has a changing room at Man United? I thought that was quite amusing.\"",
      "Grimsby's stunning victory made them the first fourth-tier side in English football history to eliminate United from cup competition. It represented another dismal display from the Red Devils, who remain winless in the current season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "There had been initial encouragement following their spirited performance against Arsenal at Old Trafford, despite succumbing 1-0 to the north London outfit. A frustrating 1-1 stalemate at Fulham brought United back to earth, but the defeat to Grimsby has sent morale at Old Trafford plummeting.",
      "Having observed United's arrival, Stockwood remarked the Red Devils' players appeared ill-equipped for the wet and combative test awaiting them at Blundell Park. He added: \"They clearly didn't know what they were coming into.",
      "\"When the players came off the bus and onto the pitch, I stood around and the United players did not look like they were up for it. It was all the cliches.",
      "\"They have got all those incredible talents and I'm a massive fan of the Premier League. The individual talent on display last night was extraordinary.",
      "\"The team performance speaks for itself from United. But seeing them coming in, they did not look like they wanted to be there, which I really enjoyed!\"",
      "United encounter another awkward test at the weekend when they welcome Burnley to Old Trafford. The newly-promoted outfit are buoyant after defeating Sunderland in their most recent Premier League encounter, before overcoming Derby County 2-1 in the League Cup.",
      "Given the current atmosphere, both inside and outside of United, a match against Scott Parker's team could prove to be a tricky affair.",
      "With crucial fixtures against arch-rivals Manchester City and a home game against Chelsea on the horizon, United are in dire need of a win.",

      "Jones' decision marks another landmark in Biancheri's young career. The United ace, who has featured in both of the Reds' Under-21s opening two Premier League 2 outings this season, is deemed as one of the most exciting talents within the club's academy.",
      "However, he is eligible to play for both Wales and Canada at international level and spent time training with the latter's senior squad earlier in the summer.",

We always feel fully confident of what we create in all age groups in terms of our environment and what it feels like, and should feel like, to represent our country.",
      "\"It was something he felt he needed to explore and all we could do was support him. The difficulty is that the scrutiny is a lot more in the older age groups.",
      "\"I've had two calls with him since he's returned that were positive. 'It just wasn't Wales' was quite a nice line for him to give us to know that we'd have the confidence to select him back into our environment, so we have brought him back in and he's itching to go.\"",

      "Manchester United have agreed to sell Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea for £40million.",
      "Garnacho has been training on his own at Carrington since July. Chelsea have been in negotiations to sign Garnacho and the London club have agreed a £40m fixed fee, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee.",
      "The 21-year-old will become United's fourth-highest sale in history, following Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, and Angel Di Maria. Chelsea initially entered discussions by offering £25m for the youngster.",
      "Garnacho's sale will also represent the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "Club sources believe they have negotiated a pragmatic deal for a player who has been pushing strongly to leave, following a deterioration in his relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed and the winger questioned Amorim's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Garnacho on a free transfer from Atletico Madrid in September 2020 and after progressing in the academy and winning the FA Youth Cup, the youngster became an established part of the first-team squad.",
      "Garnacho was handed his senior debut by Ralf Rangnick in April 2022 against Chelsea at Old Trafford.",
      "He developed further with Erik ten Hag in charge during 2022/2023, contributing six goals and six assists in 37 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Garnacho consolidated himself as a key player during Ten Hag's tenure and scored the opening goal in the FA Cup final victory against Manchester City at Wembley in 2024.",
      "Garnacho will leave United having scored 26 goals in 144 senior appearances.",
      "United say Garnacho leaves for Stamford Bridge with their best wishes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Saturday's Premier League clash with Burnley at Old Trafford will mark Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's 35th domestic game in charge.",
      "The Portuguese chief, despite the season only being three games old, is already under increasing pressure following Wednesday night's shock Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Following a 2-2 stalemate at the end of 90 minutes, United exited the competition following a 12-11 defeat on penalties. Bryan Mbeumo, who stepped up to take his second effort of the shootout, missed the decisive penalty, striking the crossbar.",
      "As a result, United have no choice but to focus on the Premier League until they enter the FA Cup at the third round stage in January.",
      "The Reds have no European football to look forward to this season after last term's struggles, meaning they will have to seriously improve their success rate against their domestic rivals if they are to make this season a success.",
      "Since replacing Erik ten Hag last November, Amorim has overseen just eight domestic victories in 34 matches across the Premier League, the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup. The FA Cup victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in January was decided on penalties following a 1-1 draw, and Law 10.2 in the Laws of the Game states that penalty shootouts are separate from the scoreline at the end of 'normal' time.",
      "As a result, Amorim's tally of domestic victories as United boss stands at just eight, of which seven have been achieved in the Premier League.",
      "Since taking charge of United for the first time against Ipswich Town at Portman Road on November 24 last year, United have amassed just 28 points from a possible 87.",
      "You cannot overlook the fact Amorim inherited a difficult situation last season and tried to completely overhaul United's style of play, but this is a club that prides itself on victories and trophies. Wednesday night's events at Blundell Park served as a stark reminder that they are light years away from where they aspire to be.",
      "Although the season is only three games old, United's failure to get a win on the board thus far is only increasing pressure on Amorim. Is he solely to blame for the current situation? Of course not.",
      "Nevertheless, he is the head coach and was brought to Old Trafford to deliver results. Nine months into his tenure and victories have been few and far between.",
      "Despite highlighting the negatives, I believe Amorim should be given longer to translate his plans to the pitch and be given the chance to bed in his new signings in the hope of a turnaround, given we are just three games into a new season after a £215million summer spend.",
      "United are already onto their sixth permanent boss since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, meaning another change in the dugout isn't guaranteed to make any difference.",
      "However, consideration to Amorim's future might become inevitable in the coming weeks and months if the situation fails to improve. Eight wins in 34 matches is simply unacceptable.",
      "With Burnley up next, and the international break to follow immediately after it, failure to collect three points against the Clarets will have severe consequences. A trip to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City follows the pause.",
      "The pressure is already ramping up and it will only grow if Burnley aren't beaten at Old Trafford.",
      "But considering United have won just one of their last 11 Premier League matches either side of the summer break, you would not bet against them stumbling again and the pressure on Amorim's shoulders becoming even greater.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and even at this early stage, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names. In a fun twist, there are currently 14 joint top-scorers in the Premier League with two goals each. A lot of them – no offence, Jurrien Timber – are nevertheless not that close to the top 10 favourites to still be top scorer in nine months’ time",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "You would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "Among the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "Not since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "One of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "Two fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "Has any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "Has made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "Faded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres, but it’s all evened out as players have caught up with the Norwegian.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an assist against Newcastle. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",

      "It’s Nottingham Forest so of course one of the few unbeaten Premier League managers this season could get sacked. But at least he is now behind Graham Potter and Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Losing late in the Carabao Cup certainly hasn’t helped.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",

      "Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure at Manchester United with rising concerns of another botched summer at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim’s side have no win from their first three games of the season, with the penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby in the Carabao a stunning nadir for team and manager. The sight of him, 2-0 down to League Two opposition and fiddling about with magnets on his tactics board, already has a McClaren’s Umbrella feel to it.",
      "If Amorim is done for, the next question becomes who could take over at Manchester United? We have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund boss was high in the reckoning for the Tottenham job, mostly we suspect because he is available. The same criteria could get him the nod here, and it’s fair to say that former Dortmund bosses have generally done okay in Our League.",
      "",
      "Has done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should, they definitely won’t.",
      "",
      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until next summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "",
      "Has extended his Germany contract until after Euro 2028, which would appear to rule him out, but the lure of the elite club game can be strong and Nagelsmann in the Premier League has long felt inevitable somewhere down the line.",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an “interesting” club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Backed in over recent days as talk continues to swirl around his Nottingham Forest future. He’s a fine manager, but we simply cannot see United going for this at all. Especially given how his previous attempt to manage a Big Six banter club turned out.",
      "",
      "Would ‘knows the club’ trump the fact that Carrick has not long been sacked by a Championship club? It didn’t work out brilliantly for Frank Lampard at Chelsea, but it remains a curiously beguiling CV booster even at the very heftiest of clubs.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "That FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has taken the Austrian high up all the lists, and now right to the very top of the silliest of all of them with Spurs off the table for at least the next few months.",

      "The Saturday 3pm slot has been decimated and desecrated more than ever this Premier League season, but it refuses to go quietly.",
      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",
      "Andoni Iraola might just be a genius, while Ruben Amorim looks more lucky general after a late VAR intervention spared United more blushes after a truly mortifying week.",
      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "Undoubtedly the less likely of Spurs’ twin bids to bag a spare centre-back from the great Man City Squad Reduction sale, but the two clubs have spent a lot of this summer in conversation with each other so we’re not ruling it out altogether.",
      "",
      "Tottenham actually landing one of their top targets in Xavi Simons as Chelsea dawdled over whether they really needed yet another tricky little No. 10 type sees their interest in swooping for another Hammer after signing Mohammed Kudus early in the window cool somewhat, with Aston Villa now sniffing around in their increasingly desperate hunt for warm bodies to bring in to a threadbare squad.",
      "",
      "The signing of Nick Woltemade means Newcastle are very unlikely to bring in Strand Larsen, with Wolves always deeply reluctant to sanction any move. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira is not ruling out his departure, though, and Craig Hope reported on Friday that the striker isn’t playing against Everton this weekend, which certainly adds fuel to the fire, while not aligning with the club’s stance on his exit. Maybe they’re just waiting for the window to close and for this all to blow over after the player’s ‘polite’ request to be sold. But he’s just too similar to Woltemade and Yoane Wissa is a more realistic option.",
      "",
      "Manchester United still seems the likelier destination for the keeper, but the idea of Villa hijacking them is an amusing one. Galatasaray have also been linked, but we assume Ederson remains their top target for now.",
      "",
      "The City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray, while Crystal Palace have also made a play for the veteran, and Bayer Leverkusen could pursue when Piero Hincapie completes his Arsenal move. Meanwhile, Galatasaray and AC Milan are also keen, with the former agreeing a £15m fee with City. The Swiss hasn’t agreed personal terms with Gala and Spurs’ interest in genuine, but Milan are leading the race.",

      "Donnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",

      "You could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",

      "The good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend.",
      "Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "Beier would indeed be a Wissa replacement though and Bild are claiming Brentford are ready to pay €70m [£60m], because it’s now apparently a requirement for Premier League teams to pay at least double what Bundesliga strikers are worth.",

      "City are encouraging Akanji out of the door and Milan are the current frontrunners. The Italian giants are in talks with the defender’s agent and the club’s director, Tare, has also confirmed the news: “The change of system put us in a difficult position because we need to be smart and sign an experienced player, and he’s a fitting profile.”",
      "",
      "United certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnarumma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",

Unfortunately for them, Chelsea are doing Chelsea things. He won’t even be loaned or sent to sister club Strasbourg and a move to Stamford Bridge would be an initial loan. It’s all quite bizarre. Poor Leeds is our main takeaway.",
      "",
      "Isak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they appear set to do with a £140m bid ‘ready’.",

Kiwior has proven himself as a top player, especially against Real Madrid in the Champions League, but it looks like the Gunners will pretty much break even with a £23m sale.",
      "",
      "The Ebere Eze hijack repeated itself as Arsenal’s arse was kicked into gear by Spurs’ interest in Hincapie, who is now very close to completing a move to the Emirates. The signing will be an initial loan with an obligation to buy, ensuring the deal goes on the books next year instead. It’s another defender for Mikel Arteta, who has an addiction. In fairness, he’s losing Kiwior and most probably Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is in talks with Marseille.",

      "Aston Villa have ‘expressed an interest’ in completing a deal for West Ham star Lucas Paqueta and could hijack Manchester United in another pre-deadline transfer.",
      "The Villans have been quiet this summer after failing to qualify for the Champions League on the final day of last season has further limited an already small transfer budget as they struggle to star with the confines of PSR regulations.",
      "Only goalkeeper Marco Bizot and forward Evann Guessand have been signed this summer for little more than £30m, while 14 players have left either on loan or permanently.",
      "And Unai Emery confirmed in his press conference ahead of their clash with Crystal Palace on Sunday that he “needs two or three players more” before the window shuts on Monday.",
      "Emery said: “We are not expecting something special for the last three days around letting some players leave in the last two to three days.",
      "“We are expecting to add us some players, because we need to improve only for numbers in the squad with the players we will want for the season, and now we need two or three players more. This is the idea.”",
      "Villa are still in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over re-signing Marco Asensio, who impressed for them on loan in the second half of last season.",
      "MORE ASTON VILLA COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 West Ham above Man City and Chelsea in five-year Premier League net spend table!\n👉 Aston Villa can awake from their transfer slumber to block Alexander Isak to Liverpool\n👉 Liverpool plot £210m double deal after Newcastle confirm Isak boost and ‘direct contact’ from RB Leipzig",
      "Personal terms aren’t thought to be an issue but the two clubs are struggling to agree a fee for the Spain international.",
      "And that’s pushed Villa to consider a move for Paqueta, who scored a stunning goal in the 5-1 defeat to Chelsea last weekend and has started all three of the Hammers’ first three fixtures of the season after the FA announced in July that a regulatory commission had found the most serious charges of spot fixing against the Brazil international “to be not proven”.",
      "He was heavily linked with a move to Manchester City in the summer of 2023 before that allegations came to light and The Athletic now claim Villa have ‘expressed an interest’ in landing him before the deadline, with Emery and Villa’s recruitment Staff ‘big admirers’ of the 28-year-old.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Arranging a financial package, however, is very tough to do, with Villa working to comply with UEFA restrictions and the likely fee West Ham will demand is prohibitive.’",
      "And The Telegraph’s Mike McGrath claims Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens – who’s thought to be on the verge of a move to Manchester United – has also ’emerged as an option for Aston Villa’.",
      "McGrath adds that Galatasaray are also in the running for the 23-year-old, with ‘nothing decided yet’ on his landing spot this summer.",
      "Premier League side Tottenham have made yet another offer to sign Nico Paz from Italian outfit Como this summer, according to reports.",
      "Premier League title hopefuls Arsenal are ready to make an opening offer for Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",
      "Manchester City are back in the hunt for West Ham United playmaker Lucas Paqueta, who is available for £30million, according to reports.",
      "While found innocent of the most serious offences, Paqueta faces punishment after failing to comply with the FA’s investigation",
      "According to reports, West Ham United star Lucas Paqueta will avoid a lifetime ban as he is ‘set to be cleared of spot-fixing charges’."

      "Plenty of you believe Ruben Amorim should either resign or be sacked, with three replacements touted in the Mailbox, but he’s also not the problem in the minds of many, and as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s also a bit of Newcastle anger at Liverpool and some Champions League frustration, but this is indeed another Amorim, Manchester United edition.",
      "Send your thoughts on the Old Trafford mess or anything else to theeditor@football365.com.",
      "",
      "There’s something fundamentally wrong about the United spirit. It’s bigger than squad revamp, or structural development. It’s the psyche.\nIn the Fergie era, playing against a team with John O’Shea and Fredrico Macheda, you still held your breath, knowing that United were capable of springing up surprises.",
      "Since Fergie’s departure, there’s a kind of trepidation coaches face with managing the team. Every coach since then, has tried to pick out scapegoats responsible for dampening the team spirit and there’s been much talk on players who are hungry enough to win for the team. In spite of it, the sloppiness lingers. The team spirit remains lackadaisical. Players do the bare minimum with the only consistent player across several seasons being Fernades.",
      "The reason I adore Mourinho’s time with United is based on the simple fact he worked the boys to a Europa trophy. You could see the way some of the players limped towards their medals. He pushed them hard. It reminded of what it meant to play for Ferguson. You either worked your butt off or moved. Other coaches treat them as snowflakes.",
      "Amorim’s recent interview has shown he is not fit for the job. His morale is low. His drive, beaten up. He has not shown any sense of urgency by tweaking his formation. He is like the proverbial mad man doing the same thing over and again while expecting the same results.",
      "This is business, not a charity organization. If he can’t inspire this team, after ostracizing other players in his revamp, he should resign.\nVictor, Nigeria. Glory Glory Man Utd.",
      "",
      "What (the f..k) is wrong with MUFC? Your inbox is overflowing with vitriol, hand wringing and hundreds of different interpretations but I have YET to see one viable solution. We’ve changed owners, infrastructure, coaches, players, playing style and goodness knows what else yet nothing seems to have worked.",
      "Maybe, as someone (somewhat harshly) said, we’ve just reverted back to the mean, i.e. pre Fergie days, the days of Duxbury and Blackmore, or the 70’s team that got relegated, before we developed (or more accurately, marketed!) this rubbish about DNA. The media follows and scrutinizes every nuance (“his facial expressions look like he’s given up”) and former players constantly pound on about how things used to be. They remind me of the MAGA folk with their constant mantra of “Make United Great Again”. Let’s me honest, during the Fergie years, we were blessed, spoilt and damn lucky. A whole bunch of things came together at the same time. The stars were aligned. But WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT TO EVER BE THAT GOOD AGAIN. And this is the simple fact that everyone seems to be ignoring.",
      "The current owners suck every penny possible from the club while the players drive up in luxury cars.  I’m sure it’s a toxic place to work at the moment. We’ve had countless managers in the last few years. Does anyone seriously think a new manager is the solution? And as Amorin said, you can’t change all 22 players. “Open Heart Surgery”? This patient has flat lined.",
      "The only solution, as far as I can see, is to stick with Amorin and go down. This will shed the prima donnas and allow us to re-build with young, hungry youth who still think it is a privilege to play for the shirt (which ironically is what Amorin did at Sporting). Last season we were (un)lucky not to go down and just a few months later, Gary Neville thinks we will make the Top Four! Maybe a season or two out of the spotlight is about the only thing that hasn’t been tried. Then we will really see who wants to play for MUFC making JUST 50k a week!\nAdidasmufc (If it forced the Glazers to sell, it might even be worth it)",
      "",
      "So the Man Utd manager merry go round looks like it’s cranking up again right on time. I’d expect the players to come out and give another terrible performance against Burnley just to twist the knife and ensure there is no option but to sack Amorim. 2-0 or 3-1 to Burney I would guess with a goalkeeper howler the icing on the cake – probably an Olympico.",
      "Whether you want him to stay longer or not, like him or not, it is pretty ridiculous to blame the manager. Yet another high profile manager who has failed.",
      "So it must be the players then? According to Transfermkt we have the 5th most expensive squad in the league. And we were 5th last year too yet finished 15th. So it surely cannot be the quality of the players.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the players attitude is terrible and has been for a long time regardless of who is in charge. They do manage to pick themselves up for the big games and occasionally get a commendable draw to fool us into thinking there’s some hope. Attitude is not the players fault. Your attitude is driven by your compensation and working conditions. Clearly Utd players are extremely well compensated so even clearer is that their working conditions must be absolutely atrocious. Yes, it must be terrible to pick up 200 k per week to kick a ball about I hear you say. Grimsby players are happily kicking a ball about with smiles on their faces for significantly less money. So are most of the other teams in the premier league.",
      "So yeah, let’s just get a shiny new manager again, spend a few hundred million on his type of players and listen to the club bulshit us that they have a long term plan and that it will take a few transfer windows to fix. Don’t worry, we’ll win the league in three years time lads, we have a plan… does the 3 years start again with the new manager? Asking for a friend…",
      "The way the club is run, we deserve to be relegated but that still wouldn’t make those in charge stop and think that maybe it’s never been the pl;ayers or the manager, they’re just the easy targets of a club where so many senior club positions have seen well renowned people come and go with such regularity that clearly there is political fuck-tard-ery hapenning that is ruining the club from the inside. We have no right to think we should be title contenders every year but the amount of money the club has compared to the rest does mean that the current state of the club can only be caused by severe incompetenece at board level.\nJon, Cape Town (Get relegated, Glazers out, maybe we might win a few games in the Championship, especially if all our current players defect and we have to bring through our youth.

      "When Rúben Amorim walked into Manchester United, I’ll admit it: I let optimism in through the front door. Not blind optimism, not naïve giddiness, but a conscious decision on how to live life and how to relate to football. Supporting United, after all, isn’t just about results. It’s about how you choose to hold yourself through the cycles of joy and pain.",

      "Arsenal: Pleasure in the Pain",
      "A loss is a loss, and a title race probably died before it was ever born – but the performance brought more pleasure than pain. United played well. Fine margins swung the contest: VAR blessing Arsenal with a questionable goal, a penalty shout ignored, Dorgu’s shot pinging off the post, Raya standing tall in goal. There was enough there to feel alive again, to sense possibility.",
      "Fulham: A Half to Remember Against Fulham,",
      "Disappointment on paper but a bright first half. Cunha already looks like he could be sensational. Amorim nailed it in his analysis: United became too focused on holding onto the result rather than playing. That’s coaching clarity – an honesty I value more than lip service.",
      "Grimsby: oh God Grimsby! Goalkeepers and Perspective",
      "Then came Grimsby. What do you even say? The truth is simple: United need a goalkeeper. Hard to find, harder to bed in, but the difference it makes is night and day.And yet as bad as it was and jeez loueeeze Onana why! — United clawed back to 2-2, showed fight, and were a penalty away from advancing. Embarrassing? Of course. Defining? Not really. Ole reached semis and finals without winning them. Ten Hag delivered two trophies, but that wasn’t enough to make me shed a tear when he left. In fact i cheered. He was an odd man!  Football moves on.",
      "On Amorim",
      "Here’s the crux: I love Amorim. It could be another false dawn. He could be sacked tomorrow if results don’t turn. His post-Grimsby interview carried a chill that United fans know too well. But that doesn’t shake me.  Because how you support your club is personal. For me, it’s not about playing small or coy. I grew up in the glory days. I will die on the hill that football is cyclical, and United will be back. Juventus were relegated, came back, and won multiple titles. Why should Manchester United be any different?So yes, results are awful. Amorim’s future is uncertain. But Manchester United aren’t a pity project. We’re a behemoth, and behemoths rise. Sunnier days will come.",

Once he’s finally jettisoned from the Ibrox hot seat he’ll hopefully never darken the door of a dugout ever again.",
      "Without going into detail about our inevitably pathetic start to this season under Martin (because I know that know one is bothered about Scottish football other than Johnny Nic), I wanted to touch on the strangely similar fates of Rangers and Man Utd, two former perennial league challengers who suffered equally if slightly different humiliations on Wednesday night.",
      "Both clubs emerged as the dominant force in their countries in the 90s, both big spenders who could pick and choose who they wanted and hoovered up trophy after trophy, becoming the panto villains of their leagues. Then in the 2000s, both were suddenly pegged back by domestic challenges – in Scotland from a Larsson-inspired O’Neill side and from Wenger/Mourinho respectively in England. The trophies weren’t as easy to come by in this decade though both clubs did manage 3 titles in a row amongst some other great moments.",
      "Then the wheels come off. For Rangers this is 2012, admin, relegation to the Scottish third division and a painful and mind-numbing climb back up to the top flight. For United, 2013 and the retirement of Fergie. Obviously their 2010s weren’t as totally abject but it’s clearly when the rot set in.",
      "Since then both clubs have had little glimmers of hope – the odd trophy, a league title for Rangers, both have reached EL finals – but currently both find themselves with unwanted and disliked ‘system’ managers with neither the players to play these systems, nor the ability to coach them.",
      "Maybe they’re still the clubs which best represent the UK in 2025. Both fallen giants, one with a huge global reach but with supporters who must be wondering why they should still bother to respect their adopted club, the other undone by financial mismanagement and dodgy tax practices. Both currently owned by Americans.",
      "So what lies in store for these two 90s giants? Do we sit tight and await the arrival of some sort of new generational manager to rescue us? Hope that our rivals fail so badly as to allow us to catch up? What does it mean when the classic glory-hunter clubs stop achieving glory?",

      "As my mail a week back, when United were still riding the high of the Arsenal draw, already said: Amorim is a goner.",
      "1. Tactical inflexibility. His formation doesn’t suit the squad and actually makes good players worse by forcing them into bad roles. He insists on two in midfield — but in the Premier League, you need two cyborgs to cover that ground. Cyborgs don’t exist yet.",
      "2. The Bruno dilemma. Amorim didn’t have the guts to move on from Bruno at the pivotal moment when the money could have been reinvested. Instead, the team remains unbalanced around him.",
      "3. Favoritism over competition. He preaches competition but picks his favourites regardless of form. That’s how you lose the dressing room — just ask Ten Hag or Solskjaer.",
      "4. The “donut guy” effect. Amorim is the classic office donut guy: bad at his job but really nice, so people look the other way. He gives media and YouTubers open access, which shields him from proper criticism.",
      "All in all, he’s finished. The real worry is what comes next. The United hierarchy will panic and swing back towards a “local” man-manager type — Gareth Southgate territory — and we’ll end up with another Maguire contract to show for it.",
      "Mark my words.",
      "Kind regards,\nMike",
      "",
      "For such a big fellow, Andre Onana sure has weak hands, and everybody knows it now. Will he leave at a deep discount after a loan ot three, or grimly run his contract down? And is Amorim as done as he looks, or is ownership paralyzed by the investments they’ve made in him — i.e., the good players he’s discarded and/or demoralized, some of whom have already been sold at significant losses, and the dubious players he’s brought in for his 343 master plan that’s, honestly, *this close to clicking. I’m rather hoping it’s the latter, because I’d be quite keen to see Kobbie Mainoo in black and white. I do think that Manchester United supporters should keep faith in Mbeumo and Sesko, though.

While I watched, I was almost always angry at what your lot got away with; I’ll spare you the list, of which I hope you have been made aware by now. That said, it wasn’t all one-way. We got away with a few bad fouls, too, and nobody is complaining about Gordon’s red card (except at Gordon himself). We can all do with being less one-eyed.

      "That said, sometimes sacking the manager is still the right thing. Moyes was out of his depth, had entirely the wrong attitude. And while his backing such as it was made headlines for all the wrong reasons, he also could fall back on a squad that had just won the league. Aging, sure, but obviously capable. We can definitely agree that it set the tone for the utter dismantling of everything that had been built.",
      "Ole was also shafted by the board deciding unilaterally to sign Ronaldo even though he wasn’t needed or wanted by the manager. He completely destabilised the team that was seeming to be coming together. He might have even got something out of Sancho, because there’s a lad that needs an arm round the shoulder not being shouted at. He did choose to sign Maguire though, so he’ll always have that mark against him. But sacking Ole was wrong, for me. The facts of his tenure prove it.",
      "We weren’t wrong to sack Jose, who had made the club a very unpleasant place. I think we were wrong to sack Van Gaal. Yes, the football made your eyes bleed but he was in the middle of changing the team, and had form for delivering good football. He still brought success.",
      "Similarly, we were wrong to sack Ten Hag, who was also in the middle of the rebuild, and delivered success on the pitch. We replaced “he has no style” with *this*, after all, and mostly because he never got the media onside. But we should have also listen to Rangnick (also more points per game than Amorim).",
      "It is clear to anyone with eyes that Amorim is not providing any answers and is making more problems than solutions. He needs to go. Whoever comes next needs to be someone who picks the team up again. We aren’t in a position of expecting success – although inevitably there are many “fans” who think otherwise – but we absolutely have a squad that should be at the upper end of the league. That’s not entitlement, that’s just plain obvious. We were, after all, 4 points from 3rd and FA Cup holders when this maniac was appointed against the judgement of Dan Ashworth. The arrogance and ignorance of billionaires in full effect.",
      "The answer is someone stable, who brings some happiness back to the squad. I don’t want it to be Southgate – he was a little weasel of a player – but managers like him are two a penny. And maybe someone like Ruud or Carrick would have a higher ceiling? Give them until the end of the season and then extend for another year, year on year.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s Man United nightmare stooped to new lows in midweek, as his side lost to fourth tier Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, and they will be seeking a response when they host Burnley on Saturday.",
      "The Red Devils bounced back from 2-0 down to go to penalties, but misses from Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha cost them dearly and they lost the shootout.",
      "Now they have the opportunity to bounce back from that humiliation with a Premier League clash with newly promoted Burnley.",
      "The pressure will be on in front of their home crowd and the atmosphere will be tense, it feels like a must win for Amorim even this early in the season.",
      "We’re yet to see the best of the trio of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, but if they click they could be a match made in heaven.",
      "They come up against Burnley, Scott Parker’s side had a tough start to life back in the top flight with a 3-0 defeat at Tottenham, but they bounced back with a 2-0 win over fellow promoted team Sunderland.",
      "There was a lot of noise about how competitive the promoted sides could be after all of them going down in the last two seasons, but they’ve all notched up a win in their first two games.",
      "Parker’s Burnley are a solid unit and their defensive reputation precedes them and on current form, Man United could struggle to break them down.",
      "It’ll certainly be interesting to see how Man United perform after the embarrassment at Grimsby and you’ll be able to follow it on our new live score centre.",
      "In terms of injuries, there aren’t too many concerns for Amorim, with Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui the only absentees.",
      "We imagine that Sesko will be given his first Premier League start, after United scored just once in their opening two games.",
      "It’s likely that Altay Bayindir will return to the side in favour of Andre Onana.",
      "Scott Parker’s team have a few absentees, with Manuel Benson, Zeki Amdouni, Connor Roberts and Jordan Beyer all ruled out with injury.",
      "Martin Dubravka is likely to return in goal after Max Weiss replaced him for the 2-1 win against Derby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Former Man City man Kyle Walker is set to start, while Bashir Humpheys could return at the heart of defence.",

      "Man United are unbeaten in seven games against Burnley.",
      "Burnley’s last victory against the Red Devils came in 2020, when they won 2-0 at Old Trafford, which is their only victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League era.",
      "The pair drew 1-1 in their last clash, with Antony and Amdouni the goalscorers.",
      "On reaction to Grimsby defeat “Every time when we have a defeat like that, I am like that. Sometimes I hate my players sometimes I love them, sometimes I want to defend them. This is my way of doing things. I was so frustrated and annoyed. I know there are a lot of experienced people talking about how I should be with the media. To be more calm. I’m not going to be like that. I am going to be who I am. At that moment I was very disappointed. We had a good pre-season. We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And a bad game against Grimsby. Now it is a new game and I am focused on that.”",
      "On Kobbie Mainoo “He needs to fight for his place and we need Kobbie. That is not going to change. I understand players not playing are disappointed but everyone will have the same opportunity to play and must fight.”",
      "On talks during international break “I always have conversation with them I am just focused on this game. I have to live this day by day. If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that. And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It’s going to be hard. But now I’m good with the next one.”",
      "On Manchester United: “We are playing against an exceptional and a historic football club. They have some top quality players, who can change games at any moment. We are under no illusions of the task we have ahead of us.”",
      "On the atmosphere:  “Of course it’s a tough arena, a 70,000 crowd and the stadium itself, along with the magnitude of what Manchester United and Old Trafford is.”",
      "On transfers:  “A lot of boxes need to be ticked for us to go into the window. There will be some players who will leave and getting that game time is essential for them.”",
      "Sam Barrott will be the referee for this Premier League clash.",
      "Barrott has refereed 39 Premier League games, issuing 159 yellow cards and two reds.",
      "He’s taken charge of four Clarets’ games across his career and they’ve lost three of those four (1 W).",
      "He’s also refereed the Red Devils twice, with one win and one defeat coming from those matches.",
      "It’ll be a tense atmosphere at the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday and we think that could transfer into a tight contest out on the pitch.",
      "That’s usually the pattern for this fixture, with only two of the last nine games producing more than three goals, so under 2.5 goals is worth a punt.",
      "Despite their recent troubles, United should still have enough to beat Burnley and them to win by a one goal margin looks to present good value."

      "Amorim added: “Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years. Some times I love to be with my players, sometimes I don’t want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It’s going to be hard. But now I’m good with the next one.”",
      "On how he speaks to the media, Amorim continued: “I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I’m not going to be like that.",
      "“So I’m trying to accept that and I’m going to be who I am. That’s why I have the passion that I have. In that moment I was really upset and really disappointed because I felt that we had a very good pre-season, we were playing better, we were being consistent in the way we played.",

At the same time, the Brazilian would be offered a long-term, increasing contract to compensate for this initial reduction that fits within the parameters set by the club, and other amounts in the event of a sale.’",

      "The report claimed Antonio Conte’s Italian champions have a long-term contract ready for Mainoo, who views the Serie A club as the best place to develop.",

      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson gets his first senior England call-up as Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jack Grealish miss out.",
      "The 22-year-old has been a central figure since joining Forest from Newcastle United in 2024, playing a major role in the club qualifying for Europe for the first time in three decades.",
      "He featured in all but one of their Premier League games last season, scoring twice and setting up six more.",
      "Anderson has started the new campaign similarly, playing every minute of Forest’s opening fixtures.",
      "His driving run and pass created Chris Wood’s winner against Brentford, while Thomas Tuchel was in attendance as he impressed again in the 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace last weekend.",
      "International recognition has been a long time coming for Anderson. Born in Whitley Bay, he represented Scotland at youth level and was even called up by Steve Clarke in 2023 before withdrawing through injury.",
      "He later committed his future to England and became a fixture in the Under-21 squad, helping them win the European Championship this summer and earning a place in UEFA’s team of the tournament.",
      "His rise has been steady rather than sudden. Anderson first joined Newcastle at the age of eight, signing his first professional deal in 2019 before making his senior debut in the FA Cup against Arsenal two years later.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Southgate for Amorim the answer for ‘entitled’ Man Utd vs the Glazers as ‘only one good player signed’\n👉 Big Weekend: Liverpool v Arsenal, Ruben Amorim, Newcastle’s new striker, Rangers v Celtic\n👉 Transfer rumour ranking: Woltemade to Newcastle and another crazy Bundesliga striker offer",
      "A loan spell with Bristol Rovers in 2022 accelerated his progress. He scored seven goals in 21 appearances and was memorably compared to Diego Maradona by Joey Barton. Anderson (pictured below) scored the Gas’ seventh and promotion-sealing goal against Scunthorpe.",
      "On his return to Newcastle, Anderson began to establish himself in the first team but found consistent minutes harder to come by.",
      "His £35m move to Forest in July 2024 was in part driven by Newcastle’s need to balance the books, but it quickly proved to be inspired business for the Midlands club.",
      "He became their player of the month almost immediately and by January had netted his first Premier League goal in a 3-2 win over Southampton.",
      "Tuchel has so far leaned on Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson and Curtis Jones in midfield during competitive games. Conor Gallagher has also featured.",
      "With Bellingham sidelined through injury, Anderson has stepped into the squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia next month.",
      "Alexander-Arnold and Grealish were notable absentees from the official squad announcement, while Marcus Rashford, who is on loan at Barcelona made Tuchel’s squad.",
      "England face Andorra at Villa Park on September 6 before travelling to Belgrade on September 9.",
      "Tuchel’s side have won all three of their opening Group K fixtures and sit top of the standings.",

      "Given that three Everton players were among the scorers at Molineux, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall picking up an assist to go along with his fine goal, some might be surprised to see Jack Grealish named player of the match again but he just stands out.",
      "He assisted two of the goals, taking his tally for the season to four - which is already double that of his past two seasons at Manchester City. Playing regularly again, it would be no great shock if he tops the Premier League rankings at the end of the season.",
      "But it was the goal for which he was not directly involved that most obviously showcased his brilliance. Having been denied by Jose Sa moments earlier, his vision sent Dewsbury-Hall in behind to set up Iliman Ndiaye to find the back of the net. Class.",
      "Asked about Grealish's improvement, David Moyes said: \"Well, it's nothing to do with me, let me tell you, it's all to do with Jack and his own mentality to be better.\" He added: \"The biggest compliment I can probably give him is he is better than I thought he was.\"Adam Bate",
      "But Liam Delap's injury will undoubtedly sour the mood at Stamford Bridge in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against Fulham.",
      "Enzo Maresca confirmed the striker would be sidelined for weeks after limping off in the first half with a hamstring problem - and now they must navigate a difficult return to the squad for Nicolas Jackson.",
      "The player was in Germany to complete that move and will now need to come to terms with returning to west London, after his head coach had previously sanctioned his exit.",
      "The start to the season has been strong for the Blues but they were not at their best against Fulham. If they want to keep up this strong form and remain at the top of the table, Jackson's contributions will be key.",
      "Difficult games against Brentford, Manchester United and Brighton are on the horizon in the Premier League. Not to mention the first Champions League game of the season against Bayern Munich on September 17, too.",
      "Jackson will likely be playing at the Allianz Arena in the near future - but he'll be wearing blue not red.Patrick Rowe",
      "Amid clear challenges for Manchester United, one name stands out as a potential beacon of light: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "He was consistently brilliant for Brentford and has wasted no time in slotting in perfectly in Ruben Amorim's formation. Others have floundered wearing the United strip after big-money moves but Mbeumo is relishing the responsibility based on his output in his three Premier League appearances.",
      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",
      "A toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.",
      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Twice they led, twice they were pegged back by Burnley, but Fernandes stepped up in injury time after VAR spotted a shirt pull on Amad Diallo and dispatched the penalty kick.",

      "In the 97th minute, referee Sam Barrott awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Burnley penalty area for a foul on Amad, who appeared to have his shirt pulled by Burnley winger Jaidon Anthony after a neat one-two with Fernandes.",
      "Barrott was then told to review the decision by VAR Stuart Atwell. After a three-minute review, Barrott awarded a penalty for a \"sustained pulling action\" from Anthony on Amad. The shirt pull started outside the penalty area.",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker was unable to hide his frustration at full-time: \"It's the way the game is going. It's going to become the most sterile game there is. We're probably months or a year away from not celebrating goals.",
      "\"I stand on the touchline, you score a goal and I feel like there's a million things go through your mind, a checklist, was it offside? Did he step on his toe two minutes before? We need to get a computer out.\"",

      "Similar to the later penalty that was awarded, the contact began outside of the area before the pair ended up on the floor in the area.",
      "In this case, Barrott awarded the penalty; however, following a five-minute review and being advised to check the screen, the on-field decision was overturned with a drop-ball awarded to the Clarets.",
      "\"When Kyle Walker makes initial contact, he's about a foot outside of the area, so I think it might be overturned and given a free-kick outside [the penalty area]. The actual contact is on the back of his calf and it's outside the area.",
      "\"If it's outside, it's factual [so it should be overturned]. It's in or out. So for me it's a free-kick for United from outside the area, in my opinion.\n\"The initial contact was outside and then he's fallen inside.

      "\"We tried to put people in the box. We tried to put more people inside the box, not just around the box to play the ball. Some of the things we were doing during the week and spoke about they were doing that and were focused on the game. So that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Amorim says his side need both Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha to be competitive after admitting his concerns over their respective injuries.",
      "Cunha went straight down the tunnel, midway through the first half, appearing to clutch his hamstring. Mount didn't emerge for the second half with Kobbie Mainoo replacing him during the break.",
      "Asked for an injury update, Amorim said: \"I don't know [what their injuries were]. We will check them. We need those guys really bad. We need them to be really competitive.\"",
      "United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir conceded two goals from Burnley's six shots at goal and was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal after spilling a shot following a long throw-in.",
      "Andre Onana was at fault for both Grimsby goals in midweek, allowing Charles Vernam's 22nd-minute strike to go through him at his near post before missing his punch at a cross which gave Tyrell Warren a tap-in eight minutes later.",
      "Amorim has admitted it's difficult to be a Manchester United goalkeeper such is the scrutiny on the club.",
      "\"They are humans. At Manchester United everything is the news. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper and you can see even when I change the goalkeeper these situations happen. We are in that moment. It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, we can defend better the box. We suffered a similar goal against Fulham because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"These things don't have anything to do with the goalkeeper. All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. Players are struggling a little bit with all the things that are happening around the club, that is normal. It's not just the goalkeepers; everybody has to improve.\"",
      "\"Is it really important? In the future, we are going to find out.",
      "\"These three points, I think, if you look at the game, we should solve the game right in the first half and then control the game. But it's never easy.",
      "\"We have to try to fight until the last minute, things that we overcomplicate. But for me, the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what happens, we try. During the game, we try in every moment, sometimes playing well, sometimes playing too open, too fast, losing possessions.",
      "\"But the effort was there.",
      "\"I think if you look at the first half, we have so many chances to score a goal and then that can help us to control the emotions, the game, to involve the fans.",
      "\"But we are always doing this and then you have the feeling you can control the game and I think you control it well. But then one throw-in, one set-piece in this moment is really hard for us. But I was shaking my head because sometimes things are really easy.",
      "\"I don't like to see penalties, but I like to see the image of the fans. But I was just thinking sometimes one moment can change a lot of things.",
      "\"But in that moment I just was thinking that it's fair to win this game. I was not expecting Bruno to miss two penalties in a row. So I was really confident.\"",
      "Amorim also offered an explanation as to why after starting in midweek, summer signing Benjamin Sesko returned to the substitutes' bench.",
      "Sesko started the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby, also taking part in the penalty shootout. After questions were raised due to Sesko taking United's 10th penalty on the night, Amorim revealed the 22-year-old had been suffering with cramp after completing his first 90 minutes of the season.",
      "\"So he finished the game (against Grimsby) with cramps, really in the limit. That's why we protected Ben from the penalties. And today was that reason also, because Josh is also a striker, he's an international striker.",
      "\"But I was thinking that Ben, during the pre-season, he didn't do 90 minutes.",
      "\"And he did that, even against a four-division team, he did that on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked if there will be planned talks during the international break regarding his future, Amorim said: 'I'm always talking with the board and I understand the context, the feeling, everything. So I understand that sometimes I say some things.",
      "\"Again, I will say it again when we have these kinds of moments. Today was a good day, but it was just a win. For me, it's to look at the game, we should have won in a different way.",
      "\"We should not suffer. And we return a little bit our level against Arsenal, a little bit against Fulham. And today was more or less the same.\"",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",

      "Image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo celebrating in February 2024 went viral but 16 months on all three could be heading for the Manchester United exit door; what went wrong for promising young trio and who is to blame for their failure to fire for Ruben Amorim?",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:32, UK",
      "Instantly iconic. But now, for the wrong reasons.",
      "The image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration in February 2024, appeared to showcase Man Utd's bright future.",
      "A year-and-a-half on, Hojlund and Garnacho look set to leave before the end of this transfer window, Mainoo is out of the first-team frame in the Premier League, while the club lurches into another crisis.",
      "How did it come to this? And who is to blame?",
      "Hojlund, then aged 21, had opened the scoring against West Ham. Alejandro Garnacho, just 19, struck two more. Kobbie Mainoo, the 18-year-old academy starlet, would go on to start a Euros final for England a few months later.",
      "Their combined celebration for Garnacho's first goal was a cheeky dig back at West Ham's Mohammed Kudus, who had marked his goal in the reverse fixture a couple of months earlier in similar fashion.",
      "But it came to stand for more than that. This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.",
      "Hojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.",
      "Garnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Mainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.",
      "Sitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.",
      "But unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.",
      "He could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.",
      "After all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.",
      "Yet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.",
      "The Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.",
      "He got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.",
      "A short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.",
      "There have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.",
      "For Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.",
      "And there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.",
      "Interestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.",
      "It is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.",
      "They are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.",
      "Where, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?",
      "Would Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?",
      "The pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.",
      "It has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.",
      "Hojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:52, UK",
      "But United have no intention of allowing him to go on loan and Ruben Amorim insisted on Friday that he wants the 20-year-old to stay.",

      "Mainoo has suffered a dip in form since shining for England at the 2024 European Championships, where he started the Three Lions' final loss to Spain in Berlin. He was again left out of Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad on Friday for the upcoming autumn internationals.",
      "Mainoo started 10 out of Ruben Amorim's first 13 league matches in charge but has quickly fallen out of favour under the under-fire Portuguese head coach.",
      "Amorim revealed Mainoo is currently fighting with United captain Bruno Fernandes for a spot in his midfield. Fernandes started all but four of United's 61 matches in all competitions last season.",
      "Mainoo is not the only United academy graduate facing an uncertain Old Trafford future - with Alejandro Garnacho on the verge of joining Chelsea.",

      "The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest ever sale of an academy graduate.",
      "United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.",
      "It is understood he leaves with United's best wishes.",

      "Hojlund's representative is in Naples and there is a growing confidence a full agreement will be reached.",
      "Napoli have a broad agreement in principle with Manchester United for a loan plus an obligation that would be worth £40m.",
      "The obligation is dependent on Napoli qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Asked about Hojlund on Friday, Amorim said: \"Until it is official, I cannot say much.\"",
