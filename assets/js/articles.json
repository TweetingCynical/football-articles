      "Manchester United have made their second signing of the summer after finally sealing a £71million move for Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo in another boost for Ruben Amorim's hopes of a positive second season in charge.",
      "Amorim now has two new forwards to choose from after securing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier in the window and things are now looking up for the Red Devils.",
      "United are in the United States for the start of their pre-season tour and they have a chance to rebuild positively following their disastrous 2024-25 campaign that saw them finish 15th with 18 losses.",
      "United have been alarmed by news that Andre Onana has suffered an injury set-back after tearing a hamstring and he looks likely to miss the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Back-up shot-stopper Altay Bayindir has been linked with an exit as he looks for more regular minutes, so Amorim will need a contingency plan in goal.",
      "Aston Villa's Emi Martinez has been line up as a possible option but United have already been rejected in a bid for the Argentine World Cup winner after proposing a loan deal.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the offer from United was met with \"incredulity\" and was \"rebuffed immediately\", having only just signed a 12-month extension last year.",
      "United will have to look at alternate options and Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammens is emerging as a new candidate after his superb season in Belgian.",
      "It adds that he has limited senior experience at the top level but would still be a good prospect for the future, and one that would excite United fans who have grown concerned about Onana's inconsistency.",
      "A new midfielder is also on the agenda at United this summer after losing Christian Eriksen, while there are long term doubts about veteran Casemiro.",
      "United have reportedly targeted Javi Guerra, who has become a key member of the Valencia squad and started 31 of their 38 La Liga games last season.",
      "But the 21-year-old is said to have turned down the offer of a new deal with the Spanish club, according to Marca and has demanded \"something better\" amid interest from the Red Devils.",
      "It adds that United have been \"keeping an eye on the player\" and are \"working behind the scenes\" to bring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Valencia had promised to \"create a sporting project around him\" but that offer wasn't enough for Guerra, the report says.",
      "Guerra is currently valued at £17m, but Valencia won't entertain offers of below £23m because Villarreal are entitled to a 30 percent sell-on fee.",
      "It adds that United are willing to spend up to £21.6m on Guerra as Amorim looks to add more steel to his midfield.",
      "United's newest signing is hoping to follow in the footsteps of one of United's greatest players after putting pen to paper at Old Trafford - Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Mbeumo finally arrived through the door after talks with his old club Brentford dragged on for much of the summer and he has now spoke of how he idolised Ronaldo while he was growing up.",
      "Ronaldo scored a total of 145 goals for United across two spells but it was during his first stint at the club between 2003 and 2009 where he became a legend, helping the club win three Premier League titles and the Champions League.",
      "He also won the Ballon d'Or while at United and Mbeumo has now revealed he looked up to the Portuguese superstar when he was a child.",
      "\"My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” he said when asked to name his favourite player.",
      "\"It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "\"My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford joined Barcelona on loan with a dig at Manchester United by saying: “I feel at home here – it's where dreams come true.” Rashford secured the move after falling out with United boss Ruben Amorim, who exiled him last season and decided he was not part of his future plans.",
      "Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages in full next season – saving United around £12million – and have an option to buy him for £26m at the end of the loan deal. Speaking at the Nou Camp, Rashford said: “I'm very excited. It's a club where people's dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the clubs stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "“It feels like I'm at home and this is a big factor in my choice to come here, because it's a family club, people are comfortable here and it's a good place for players to showcase their skills. I want to say thank you for the warm welcome. It's a different environment for me but it feels like home.",
      "“I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and help this club win. They won so much last year and I can see the ambition is to do better than last year and that is what you want to hear as a player.",
      "“It keeps you improving year on year and that's what you need to be - the best version of yourself. So I'm very excited to be here, eager to get the games going and I'm enjoying every minute of it.",
      "“I always try to make decisive actions - fast, dynamic plays and I always like good football, so I have always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans. It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it.”",
      "Rashford, who hopes the move will see him make England's World Cup squad for next year's tournament in the US, revealed the role Barca coach Hansi Flick played in making the move happen. “Another key factor of the reason that I'm here is the conversations I had with him,” said Rashford.",
      "“They were very positive. Last year and throughout his career he's proved he's one of the top coaches and to lead such a young team to a very successful season and coming back to still want to do more - it showed me everything that I thought I knew about the club.",
      "“Now, to be here, it's everything I wished and thought. I'm eager to get going and learn the Barcelona way and be ready for the games.”",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, where he scored four goals before injury ended his campaign early. The 27-year-old was dropped by Amorim for the derby against Manchester City last December and never played for United again.",
      "Despite offloading Rashford, United are braced to start the new season without a new striker leading their attack. A striker was the priority in this summer's transfer window, after United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "But the only two arrivals so far have been £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for £71m, neither of whom are a No.9. United have seen their top striker targets go elsewhere this summer – Liam Delap joined Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres is closing in on a move to Arsenal, while Hugo Ekitike is Liverpool-bound.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim fears there is every chance United will start their Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17 without a new striker. A swap deal involving winger Alejandro Garnacho – left out of the US tour squad after asking to leave – and Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, both valued at £40m, is an option.",
      "Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League, with Chelsea his first-choice club, although there is a reluctance at United to sell him to a domestic rival in a move that could ultimately backfire. Jackson has been pushed down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge following the arrival of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton, both of whom are ahead of him in terms of selection.",

      "Barcelona have announced that Marcus Rashford has been given the No.14 shirt after joining on loan from Manchester United. Rashford, 27, will spend the 2025-26 season with Barca, who have the option buy him for £26million next summer.",
      "The England international will wear 14 on his back while playing under Hansi Flick, aiming to break into a side who won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de Espanda last season. The number was last worn by Pablo Torre, who recently completed a permanent move to Mallorca.",
      "Thierry Henry also wore 14 during his time at Barcelona, as did the legendary Johan Cruyff. Rashford has previously compared his style of play to Henry, who was part of Pep Guardiola's famous treble-winning team in 2009.",
      "While on holiday in Marbella last month, the United loanee told Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer: \"I see myself reflected in Henry. He's comfortable playing on the left and also in the middle. He's a free player.",
      "\"As I've developed, the number 9 position has become more comfortable, more natural. Things like playing with my back to goal are becoming easier for me. You're always in front of goal and always dangerous.\"",
      "Rashford's move was announced on Wednesday after signing his contract at Barcelona's offices. Shirts with 'Rashford 14' were displayed behind him.",
      "Barca said in a statement: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of Marcus Rashford until June 30, 2026. The agreement also includes an option to buy the English striker.\"",
      "United, meanwhile, wished the 27-year-old well as they confirmed his departure. \"Everyone at Manchester United wishes Marcus good luck for the season.\"",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Rashford made it clear that he was keen to join Barcelona in the aforementioned interview. The forward was asked if he wanted to play alongside Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in the future.",
      "\"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" he replied. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Rashford was part of a five-man 'bomb squad' at United after Ruben Amorim made it clear that he, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were all not part of his plans. The quintet were left out of Amorim's 32-man squad who flew to the USA for their pre-season tour on Tuesday.",

      "Rashford has not played for United since December 2024 after a row with Amorim over his training performances and he was later sent on loan to Aston Villa, where he showed glimpses of his ability before suffering a season-ending injury.",
      "But now the 27-year-old has a chance to impress on the biggest stage and compete for a starting spot with the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha under new boss Hansi Flick. Barcelona will cover Rashford's wages for the duration of his spell, though the player will take a pay cut on his usual salary of £325,000-a-week.",
      "The club have a £26million option to buy next summer and there is huge anticipation to see how Rashford gets on alongside a star-studded squad that will be competing on multiple fronts for silverware. Rashford is said to have emerged as Barcelona's \"priority target\" after Nico Williams decided to sign a 10-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Barcelona won La Liga in Flick's first season but now want to push on and become a force in Europe, with Rashford the club's third major signing this summer after goalkeeper Joan Garcia and Copenhagen forward Roony Bardghji. Rashford's first goal at the Nou Camp will be to break into the first team, knowing it will be hard to displace either Yamal or Raphinha on the wings.",
      "Yamal is considered one of the best players in world football right now, with the teenager scoring 18 and assisting 16 in all competitions last season. Brazilian star Raphinha, meanwhile, had an even better campaign as he scored 34 times and assisted 17.",
      "Barcelona fans do appear to be excited by Rashford's arrival on loan after creating a mural for him pictured in the club's colours, while much of the reaction to his signing has been positive. Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo report that he'll wear the No.14 shirt, last worn by Pablo Torre, who recently joined Mallorca.",
      "Rashford arrives with some pedigree, having won five trophies during his time at United and scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances. He has also notched 17 goals in 62 caps for England.",

United boss Amorim was one of the first off the team bus when it pulled up at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel, only pausing to high-five members of security staff as he made his way in.",
      "But leading from the front on the pitch is continuing to prove problematic for Amorim, whose summer search for a striker to solve United's goalscoring crisis has so far drawn a blank. A meagre haul of 44 goals in the Premier League last season, as United finished 15th, their worst placing for 51 years, should have made recruiting a striker their priority in the summer window.",
      "But with 24 days until their opening fixture of the new season, at home to Arsenal, United are still grubbing around for a new No.9 to lead their line, after seeing a host of targets choose other clubs. Liam Delap joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Eintracht Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike are closing in on moves to Arsenal and Liverpool respectively.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo may have scored 15 and 20 goals respectively in the Premier League last season, more than United duo Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. But those impressive numbers from Cunha and Mbeumo do not negate the need for United to recruit a prolific striker capable of scoring 20-plus goals a season on a consistent basis.",
      "The last United player to score more than 20 Premier League goals in a season was Robin van Persie, who led the club to their last league title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012-13. But finding the back of the net remains an issue for United, as evidenced by the way they toiled in Saturday's first pre-season encounter with Leeds in Stockholm, which ended goalless.",

The mercury could pass 30 degrees in the Windy City, but the humidity will make it feel much hotter and create stifling conditions for the players.",

      "Ruben Amorim gave new signing Bryan Mbeumo a warm welcome as the forward took part in his first Manchester United training session. Mbeumo joined United from Brentford in a £71million deal on Monday and the 25-year-old has linked up with his new team-mates ahead of their pre-season tour of the US.",
      "The squad flew out to America on Tuesday, where they will take part in the Premier League Summer Series and face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton. However, United took part in one last training session at Carrington before boarding their flight.",
      "And Amorim gathered the rest of the squad together to welcome the new addition, with the Red Devils boss leading a round of applause. Mbeumo is United's third senior signing so far this summer, with Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon having joined from Wolves and Cerro Porteno respectively.",
      "Mbeumo rejected the chance to reunite with former Brentford boss Thomas Frank at Tottenham and he has explained why he was so keen to sign for United. \"From the start, I wanted to join this massive club. Now I'm here, I'm just really happy,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, it's the biggest club in the world. The fans are crazy, the stadium is amazing, and every player wants to play here. My first top was Manchester United's top with [Cristiano] Ronaldo behind. It's just such a big club and I'm really happy to be here.\"",
      "Mbeumo has also hailed Amorim, adding: \"He seems really close to his players. His mentality, his winning thinking every time, this is the thing I need. I always wanted to play at the highest level. Now I'm here and I just want to show what I can do.",
      "\"It seems to be a really good group, the spirit is really important and I've only heard good things about the gaffer and the team. It's really important for me to create links as soon as possible with my team-mates, in and out of the pitch.",
      "\"Spirit is important and I want to be involved as soon as possible. My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. When you're actually doing it, it's completely different and I'm just happy to be here.\"",
      "And United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, is confident Mbeumo is a \"perfect fit\" for the Red Devils. \"Bryan's goals and assists record in the Premier League is exceptional, his remarkable consistency has put him amongst the most productive players in England for the last three seasons,\" he said.",
      "\"Bryan's belief in our project and determination to join the club confirmed that he was the perfect fit for Manchester United and the culture that we are developing. We are delighted to have secured another one of our primary targets ahead of the pre-season tour.",
      "\"The experience in the US will be the perfect opportunity for Bryan to work with Ruben and his new team-mates as we prepare for an exciting season ahead.\"",

      "With less than a month left until their opening Premier League match against Arsenal, the next few weeks will be crucial for Amorim to implement his ideas and determine who will be his key players this season.",
      "Ahead of their four pre-season matches over the coming three weeks, United selected 32 players for the US tour. The most notable inclusion was Bryan Mbeumo, who on Monday completed his transfer from Brentford.",
      "Several promising youngsters have also been named, including the unexpected addition of Williams. The 19-year-old isn't the most celebrated or well-known academy graduate. He spent the latter half of last season on loan at Cheltenham Town in League Two, where he scored two goals and provided two assists in 17 games.",
      "It was initially thought that Williams would miss out on the tour, with a potential loan move to League One rumoured to be in the pipeline. There appeared to be no place for him in Amorim's squad as The Mail claimed he would not participate ahead of his expected loan exit.",
      "Belgian clubs Club Brugge and Anderlecht had also shown interest, preferring permanent deals. However, it seems Amorim has now changed his mind on the young talent.",
      "On Tuesday, talkSPORT reported that Amorim \"has taken a real shine to Williams,\" highlighting how the Portuguese boss has grown increasingly fond of the youngster.",
      "He could therefore be thrown into action in the States and beyond in one of the wing-back positions, where Amad thrived last season. Williams had notched 25 goal contributions while representing the academy throughout the 2023/24 season.",
      "Last term, he earned praise from Cheltenham manager Michael Flynn, who told their official website: “Ethan is a very talented player, and he comes here now to add that bit of quality in the final third.",
      "“He’s a player that makes the keeper work when he gets into the final third. I’m excited to be working with him.”",
      "Goalkeepers Dermot Mee and Will Murdock, defenders Tyler Fredricson and Ayden Heaven, midfielders Toby Collyer, Jack Fletcher and Sekou Kone, and forwards Bendito Mantato and Chido Obi are the other youngsters who have been named in Amorim's squad.",
      "United kicked off their pre-season with a disappointing 0-0 draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday. Matheus Cunha made his debut alongside new left wing-back signing Diego Leon.",

      "United rounded off lengthy talks with Brentford by sealing a £71million transfer for the Cameroonian forward and Amorim's next priority is offloading his five unwanted players who have been excluded from the team's pre-season tour in the United States.",
      "Amorim named a 32-man squad to travel to the US but Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have all been left at home after being told to find new clubs.",

      "Jadon Sancho, meanwhile, spent last season on loan with Chelsea but failed to impress as the Blues paid a £5m penalty to send him back to Old Trafford - and now he looks likely to join Juventus, though reports in Italy claim the Serie A side are \"stalling\" on the deal.",
      "Antony is also looking for a new club after dazzling while on loan at Real Betis last season, scoring nine goals, though it remains to be seen whether the Spanish side will be able to secure his signature for another season. Malacia has not played for United since January and spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV.",
      "Another player who hasn't travelled with United to the US is defender Harry Maguire due to \"person reasons\" - but the England centre-back is still expected to link up with his team-mates this week.",

The Manchester United midfielder was team-mates with the winger in Spain for three years and was certainly best positioned to analyse the heights he believed his compatriot could reach.",
      "The 24-year-old has established himself as a vital player for the Spanish giants in recent years but suffered a decrease in importance last season under Carlo Ancelotti due to the signing of Kylian Mbappe.",
      "He started just 22 league games, while getting only 92 minutes of action during Madrid's run in the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this month. His lack of game-time has led to uncertainty over his future, with Arsenal and Liverpool reportedly interested in the forward.",
      "It was earlier this year that Casemiro - who spent nine years with Madrid - showered praise on Mbappe and his former team-mates, including Rodrygo. Speaking to Diario AS, the Brazilian insisted that while the Frenchman has the ability to be the world's best, it's a label in football that the 24-year-old is also capable of.",
      "\"He [Mbappe] is one of those players that when you play against them you don't know how to stop him. He's not [on top of] the podium yet, but he'll get there,\" Casemiro said.",
      "\"He's the heir to [Messi and Ronaldo], along with Vinicius Jr, who continues to grow and improve in every game, Rodrygo, and Fede Valverde.\" It wasn't the first time he sang the praises of the winger as he said in 2022: \"He lit up my eyes.",
      "\"He's a star. God gave him the gift of playing football. Rodrygo knows when to attack, when to defend, when to be more aggressive, when to play more vertically. This kid is one of the most complete players of his generation.\"",
      "With speculation suggested Luis Diaz is ready to depart Anfield with Bayern Munich interested in the Colombian, reports indicate that the Reds are ready to pounce on Rodrygo with talks commencing with his entourage, according to Foot Mercato.",

      "The 'Special One' did win two major trophies at United and also finished second in 2017-18 and suggests Ratcliffe's lack of footballing experience might hinder the club - in a subtle jab at the billionaire and the United hierarchy.",

      "Manchester United’s desperation to get Marcus Rashford off their wage bill has seen them dramatically drop their valuation of the striker. Rashford is poised to join Barcelona on a season-long loan with an option to buy after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at United.",
      "Amorim’s relationship with Rashford broke down in December when he was ejected from the United first-team squad. He was then sent out on loan to Aston Villa in January, and having resurrected his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances, Rashford set his sights on Barca.",
      "The 27-year-old rejected a mega-money move to Saudi Arabia and has been waiting patiently for Barca and United to come to terms over a move. That has now happened and Rashford flew into the city earlier this week to complete the final stages of his move.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to take Rashford on loan for the 2025/26 season with an option to make it permanent. Barca will pay the entirety of his wages after Rashford agreed to take a 15 per cent pay cut from his £325,000-a-week wages. They can also sign him for €30million (£26m).",
      "Earlier this summer, United made it clear that they would happily sell Rashford to whichever club would stump up £40m. His contract with the club runs until June 2028, so their asking price wasn’t outrageous, especially considering they believed he was worth £100m in April 2024 when Paris Saint-Germain were sniffing around.",
      "United’s rapidly sliding scale around Rashford just demonstrates the sourness around the forward since Amorim made up his mind. The England striker has been part of Amorim’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ over the past few weeks, forced to train separately from the first team at Carrington.",
      "Rashford and fellow unwanted players Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have been arriving at the training ground post-5pm, when everyone else has already left. It is a brutal policy that doesn’t have universal support inside the building but is designed to speed up their exits.",
      "It may have played a part in securing Rashford’s exit, while Sancho is also poised to leave for Juventus. But what is more likely to have done the trick is United’s desperation to offload their high-earning players who Amorim had made clear have no future at the club.",
      "Rashford was not Barcelona’s first choice this summer. The Catalan giants had tried to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club, but the move fell through. They also showed an interest in Liverpool winger Luis Diaz, but were put off by the Reds’ transfer stance.",
      "“I don’t want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players,” manager Hansi Flick said earlier in the summer. “I like them and we’ll see what happens.”",
      "Rashford will not be a guaranteed starter, either. He can play on the left of Barca’s 4-3-3 formation, but will be aware that Raphinha has just enjoyed an incredible campaign in that position, while he will be a mere back-up to Robert Lewandowski at centre-forward.",

      "Manchester United's summer sale is now on. The Red Devils are actively working on offloading players, having finally confirmed their second major signing of the transfer window on Monday.",
      "United welcomed Bryan Mbeumo after striking a deal with Brentford following weeks of fraught negotiations. Cameroon international Mbeumo arrives for a fixed fee of £65million plus £6m in performance related add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo's addition follows that of Matheus Cunha, who the Red Devils had less hassle signing by triggering his £62.5million release clause at Wolves. Diego Leon is United's lesser-known third addition and the left wing-back made his non-competitive debut during Saturday's uninspiring 0-0 draw with Leeds.",
      "Now the focus is on selling players, particularly the five members of Ruben Amorim's bomb squad: Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Only one of those, however, looks certain to depart.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford could be made to wait longer than anticipated to make his La Liga debut. Rashford, 27, will be unveiled by Barca on Wednesday, having arrived in the city on Sunday night before filming his announcement video on Tuesday.",
      "Read the full story on Rashford here.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Arsenal are on the cusp of reaching a full agreement with Sporting Lisbon to sign Viktor Gyokeres, days after it was claimed that Manchester United were planning to hijack the transfer. Swedish striker Gyokeres had been tipped to reunite with Ruben Amorim, who brought him to Lisbon in 2023.",
      "But the Athletic report that a conclusion in talks between Arsenal and Sporting is now imminent, with only the finishing touches needed. Gyokeres, 27, will be in line to make his competitive debut for the Gunners at Old Trafford on Sunday, August 17.",
      "Read the full story on Gyokeres here.",
      "Aston Villa will demand a cool £40million for Emiliano Martinez after rejecting Manchester United's first offer. Martinez, 32, is a target for the Red Devils, who are interested in signing a new goalkeeper.",
      "But, of course, United are on a tight budget, so club chiefs initially made an approach to sign the Argentina international on loan. Villa rejected that offer and the the Mail report that they'll only be willing to accept a bid of at least £40m.",

      "Manchester United’s new signing Bryan Mbeumo already has his sights set on emulating his boyhood hero Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Mbeumo, who has joined United from Brentford in a deal worth up to £71million, revealed the first football shirt he owned growing up was Ronaldo’s iconic No.7. The Cameroon star, who plays out wide like Ronaldo but can also operate centrally, was just four when his idol joined United for the first of two spells in 2003.",
      "In that six-year spell, Ronaldo scored 118 goals in 292 appearances, before returning for an ill-fated second stint at United, which ended in acrimony after a season-and-a-half. Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, modelled himself on Ronaldo and said he dreams of matching the exploits of his hero now he is a United player himself.",
      "“My first top was one with Ronaldo behind [on the back],” said Mbeumo, when asked to name his favourite player. “It changed the time. When I was really young, the two best footballers were Ronaldo and Messi. When I was growing up, Neymar. After that, it was Eden Hazard.",
      "“My dream was to become a football player and play for one of the biggest teams in the world. But when you’re actually doing it, it’s completely different.”",
      "On the pitch, Mbeumo is an uncompromising, fearless and physical attacker, who shows no mercy to opponents in his relentless quest for goals and assists. Off it, however, he is a completely different character, with the piano and chess his chief hobbies away from the pressure of playing football at the highest level.",
      "Asked if he was quiet or loud, Mbeumo said: “A little mix of the two. I’m quite quiet when I don’t know people. But when I know everyone I make jokes and have banter. I like piano and chess. I’m just a normal guy. I discovered the piano a few years ago, when a friend was playing and I wanted to try.",
      "“With chess, I played a little bit when I was younger. Two or three years ago, I started playing and I enjoyed it, so I play online. I have a board at home but I have no-one to play with.”",
      "Part of the initiation ritual for new signings at United is to perform a song in front of the squad, with Mbeumo hinting he could go one stage further. “Maybe I can play the piano and sing!” he said. “I know I’m a calmed and chilled guy out of the pitch, but on it I change completely. I’m really determined and focused.",
      "“It comes from my parents. They gave me my values. Also, all the coaches I’ve worked with gave me a lot of advice. It’s like a family and all the things you face in your personal life helps build your mentality and character.",
      "“I grew up in a small town, where everyone knew each other and I have a lot of memories from the stadium of my first team. I try to go back there at least once a year to see my old manager and the little kids, who have a dream as well, like I had. It’s really good for them to see someone who is here now. They can see that they can do it and that’s important for me.”",
      "Piano-loving Mbeumo will hope to hit the right notes for United and help spark their revival after they ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era.",

      "Erik ten Hag is keen to finally link up with Raheem Sterling after failing to sign him at Manchester United. Ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen are reportedly one of several clubs monitoring Sterling's future after the England international was told that he could leave Chelsea.",
      "Sterling, whose last appearance for his country came at the 2022 World Cup, spent last season on loan at Arsenal. But the winger, 30, struggled for regular game-time, making just five starts in the Premier League.",
      "Having returned to Chelsea at the end of the 2024-25 season, Sterling is still not in Enzo Maresca's plans after being dramatically frozen out at the beginning of last term. That's when links of a shock move to United emerged.",
      "Despite playing for both Liverpool and Manchester City, it was claimed that the Red Devils were in talks with Chelsea, as Ten Hag was interested in Sterling. It was part of negotiations for Jadon Sancho to head the other way during the closing stages of the summer transfer window.",
      "Sancho did end up going to Stamford Bridge whereas Sterling ultimately joined Arsenal, who pulled off a final-day swoop. Eleven months later, however, Ten Hag appears to be back in for the ex-Liverpool and City star.",
      "BBC Sport report that Leverkusen, who appointed Ten Hag as their new manager in May, are keeping an eye on Sterling with a view to a potential transfer. It's added that a number of clubs on the continent are interested in the 30-year-old.",
      "Sterling still has two years left on his contract with Chelsea, who paid City £47.5m for his services in 2022. Leverkusen have cultivated English talent before, particularly wide players.",
      "Nottingham Forest forward Callum Hudson-Odoi had a season-long loan with the German giants while former Southampton ace Nathan Tella has played for Leverkusen since 2023. Ten Hag is looking to bolster his squad after losing star man Florian Wirtz to Liverpool as well as Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "Granit Xhaka is also pushing for a move to Sunderland while defender Jonathan Tah signed for Bayern Munich before Ten Hag had started his role. So far, Leverkusen's signings include PSV Eindhoven star Malik Tillman, Liverpool defender Jarell Quansah, Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken and Hertha Berlin playmaker Ibrahim Maza.",
      "Their pre-season campaign got underway in humiliating fashion with a 5-1 defeat against Brazilian side Flamengo's UNDER-20 side. Coincidentally, Leverkusen will play Chelsea in a friendly at Stamford Bridge on Friday, August 8.",

      "A former Manchester United star has exposed the tough retribution Sir Alex Ferguson delivered to a youth player who dared to ridicule him. The iconic boss was notorious for his explosive temperament throughout his 26-year reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Hardly any players managed to avoid the Scotsman's infamous hairdryer treatment, with David Beckham memorably receiving an accidental boot to the face during one of Ferguson's eruptions following a defeat to Arsenal in the FA Cup in 2003",
      "However, one member of United's academy system came to rue crossing him more than most. Former Red Devils goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has revealed how the unnamed youngster was shipped out on loan after Ferguson caught him performing an impression of him in front of senior squad members.",
      "The episode, which Bosnich recounted during a chat with ex-United and Wrexham keeper Ben Foster, occurred during the Australian's initial spell at the club between 1989 and 1991.",
      "Speaking on the Fozcast podcast, Bosnich said: \"I remember with one of the [younger] boys, the first team used to get him to imitate Fergie, because they used to say he was like Taggart.",
      "\"He came in behind him [as he was doing the impression] and he was out on loan two days later. You've got to be careful because you can't undermine the manager.\"",
      "Whilst Bosnich escaped Ferguson's wrath on that particular occasion, he recalled another incident when he wasn't so fortunate. The goalkeeper revealed how the boss lost his temper after catching him sporting long trousers during a practice match against Liverpool.",
      "\"We were 1-0 down at half-time and it was the most howling wind I've ever experienced at the Cliff, which was the old training ground,\" he said. \"It was either my first or second winter in England, and I put long pants on because I was freezing.",
      "\"He came in at half-time and he ripped me to shreds. He said, 'If you don't improve in the second half and get those long pants off, you're going up to Aberdeen and then you're going to experience what real cold is.' Eric [Harrison] told me that he wanted to see how I reacted. I took the pants off and we won 5-1 so that was alright.\"",
      "Bosnich originally departed United in 1991 owing to visa complications, but Ferguson brought him back eight years later. He was then regarded as the natural replacement for Peter Schmeichel following an impressive seven-year stint at Aston Villa.",
      "But the move didn't turn out as planned and Ferguson subsequently criticised Bosnich's mentality. The keeper transferred to Chelsea after his United exit, but received a nine-month football ban and was dismissed by his club following a failed drugs test in 2002. Despite a short-lived return in the A-League in 2008, he never featured in professional football again.",
      "In his second autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"Mark Bosnich was, in my opinion, a terrible professional, which we should have known. The Bosnich buy stemmed from Peter Schmeichel announcing in the autumn of his final season that he would be retiring, which caught us on the hop. We jumped into decisions.",
      "\"We met Bosnich in January, despite reports filtering through to us about his conduct off the pitch. I sent someone down to watch him in training. He was doing nothing in the sessions that convinced me he was the right man for Manchester United.",
      "\"I changed tack and went for Edwin van der Sar instead, spoke to his agent and then to Martin Edwards, who told me, 'Alex, I'm sorry, I've shaken hands with Bosnich.' That was a blow. Martin had shaken Mark's hand and would not go back on his word, which I respect. But it was a bad piece of business.\"",
      "Bosnich later hit back at Ferguson's account of his time at United, branding it a \"lie\" and accusing the legendary manager of holding a grudge.",
      "Speaking to FourFourTwo in 2019, Bosnich said: \"It wasn't unfair – it was just a lie. He's always said that he doesn't bear any grudges, but obviously he does. But he can say that because he knows what happened afterwards, with the drugs and so on – he's got good evidence to back himself up.",
      "\"At that time, though, it was a lie. Alex Ferguson signed me twice. I wouldn't be talking to you now about my career unless he had taken a chance on me originally. Yes, we had a falling out, but these things happen. He was a great manager to play under.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to consider Rashford for selection again after the forward blanked him following his substitution in the 2-1 Europa League win at Viktoria Plzen on December 12. Rashford and teammates Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were also instructed not to be on the premises at the same time as the United first team at their Carrington training complex this month.",
      "Rashford, 27, wanted to join Barcelona in January but had to settle for a temporary move to Aston Villa, where he scored four goals in 17 games. Barca have long admired Rashford, whose 20-year association with United has effectively ended.",
      "Rashford nevertheless wished his boyhood club well. \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\" he said at his presentation. \"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",

      "Rashford admitted he has restored \"discipline\" to his life after two turbulent years. Rashford was rebuked by former United manager Erik ten Hag for attending a birthday party hours after the 3-0 home defeat to Manchester City in October 2023 and he was dropped for the FA Cup fourth round tie away to Newport County days after embarking on a boozy bender in Belfast.",
      "The England international has trained rigorously over the summer and Rashford enthused he is \"in a good place. I'm happy, I'm healthy and I'm eager to get going.",
      "\"It's one thing to say you're motivated and determined but these are things that can change day to day depending on how you're feeling. The thing I bring back to my life, not just the sport, is discipline. I'm happy to be here and to enjoy this club. It's a different country, with different clubs, and I'm ready for this new experience.\"",

      "Valencia want around €27m for the midfielder.",
      "Man United are interested in Bologna's Dan Ndoye despite the forward being heavily tipped to join Nottingham Forest.",

      "\"He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Šeško again. The striker is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m]...\"",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, United have joined West Ham, Wolves and Southampton in the race to sign Idrissa Gueye from Metz. The report claims the 18-year-old midfielder, who mustn't be confused with the Everton ace, has also attracted interest from Borussia Dortmund and Parma.",
      "It's said that the Reds have recently entered negotiations with Gueye's entourage. The French top-flight club have reportedly given the teenager a €15m (£13m) price tag.",
      "According to French outlet Footmercato, Rasmus Hojlund is looking for a way out of United this summer. The report claims that Juventus are interested in signing the 22-year-old striker, but they're yet to make any concrete approaches.",
      "Maurizio Sarri is said to be an admirer of Hojlund and his profile, shortlisting him as a 'serious option' for Lazio. Atalanta are reportedly keeping a 'very close eye' on the Dane's situation at Old Trafford.",
      "Footmercato reckons that Hojlund's salary will be an obstacle for many clubs, so a loan with an option to buy could be feasible...",
      "According to ESPN, Unai Emery believes Alejandro Garnacho would be a useful player for his style of play, but the United winger would prefer to sign for a Champions League club.",
      "The report claims Garnacho is among several players at Old Trafford who are surplus to requirements ahead of the new season. It's said that United would be willing to drop the Argentina international's price tag to £40m in an effort to get him off the books.",
      "Garnacho sees his contract expire in June 2028.",
      "According to the Mail Online, United are ready to approach Aston Villa about a move for Emi Martinez. The 32-year-old goalkeeper seems to face an uncertain future at Villa Park despite having signed a new long-term contract last year.",
      "The report claims that United held discussions about signing Martinez over the weekend. It's said that the prospect of a loan for the Argentina international has been considered, but it remains to be seen whether Unai Emery's side would sanction such a deal.",
      "The Mail Online reckons that Martinez has already turned his nose up at an offer from the the Saudi Pro League...",
      "The RB Leipzig striker once looked set to join Arsenal, having been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium. However, the Gunners turned their attention to Viktor Gyokeres, leaving the door open for another club to swoop in.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have been offered the opportunity to sign Nicolas Jackson. The report claims that Ruben Amorim wants to sign a striker, now that he's added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to his squad.",
      "The report claims United would be open to discussing the conditions of a swap deal involving Alejandro Garnacho. It's said that Benjamin Sesko and Ollie Watkins are also options being considered at Old Trafford, as well as Dusan Vlahovic, who was offered two weeks ago.",
      "Romano reckons that Jackson's priority would be to stay at Chelsea and fight for his place, but if that's not possible, United would be considered as a good option.",
      "Marcus Rashford could make his La Liga debut later than anticipated. According to the Mirror, the 27-year-old forward, who has left Manchester United to join Barcelona on loan, will be unveiled today, having arrived in Catalunya on Sunday night before filming his announcement video on Tuesday.",
      "This has saved United about £14m! It's said there's an option to buy clause worth £30.3m (€35m)...",
      "The summer transfer window doesn't shut until September 1, but Ruben Amorim won't want any disruptions or distractions once the new Premier League season is underway.",
      "Jason Wilcox has more than enough time to further bolster the squad, but he knows that'll pass by in the blink of an eye...",

      "Galatasaray have reportedly reached an agreement with Napoli to sign Manchester United-linked Victor Osimhen on a permanent deal.",
      "The forward was widely expected to make the move to the Premier League a year ago, with United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea all reportedly showing interest. However, the Nigerian international did not secure a transfer to one of Europe's top leagues and instead signed for Turkish Super Lig club Galatasaray.",
      "In Turkey, Osimhen scored 37 goals, reigniting rumours about a possible summer move to one of Europe's elite clubs. The market for strikers is especially fierce this summer, with many of Europe's leading sides looking to strengthen their attack.",

      "Manchester United have issued an update on Lisandro Martinez's recovery from injury.",
      "The centre-back was sidelined for much of last season following a knee injury he suffered during United's 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace back on February 2. The injury was sustained in an innocuous clash with Palace winger Ismaila Sarr in the 82nd minute.",
      "Martinez underwent an operation for after injury with reports stating that recovery periods can vary greatly - spanning from six months to a year. It is claimed that if Martinez's recovery goes smoothly, he could possibly be fit for the start of the new season with United kicking off at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has previously heaped praise on Reds-linked striker Ollie Watkins.",
      "The England international reportedly grew dissatisfied at Aston Villa last season, having fallen behind United loanee Marcus Rashford in the pecking order. After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season with a 2-0 loss to United, Watkins is said to be open to exploring new opportunities.",
      "United have reportedly initiated preliminary discussions with Villa about signing Watkins, as head coach Ruben Amorim views him as an ideal player to spearhead his attack, given his proven goal-scoring ability. The Villans are reportedly demanding around £60million but United are said to be reluctant to meet this valuation due to his age and limited resale value.",

      "It was on his only Manchester United pre-season tour in 2019 that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted to journalists how much more he enjoyed speaking to us without any cameras present.",
      "In the first press conference of that tour, Solskjaer hamfistedly suggested that there was a \"media agenda\" against Paul Pogba. Days before flying to Perth, Pogba said it was \"maybe time for a new challenge somewhere else\".",
      "United protected Pogba and pandered to him time and again. Ed Woodward would emphasise how popular he was with teammates and that he liked his agent, Mino Raiola.",
      "It came at great cost. The late Raiola declared it was \"over\" for Pogba on the eve of United's decisive Champions League group game with RB Leipzig in 2020. United lost and went out. They never entertained selling Pogba and he ran down his contract for the second time in 2022, ten years on from the first.",
      "Indulging a wantaway during a pre-season tour undermines the manager. Solskjaer was saddled with Pogba and Romelu Lukaku six years ago. Erik ten Hag was in a more invidious position last year with Jadon Sancho, foisted back onto him by the Ineos brains trust.",
      "Sancho never apologised to Ten Hag for accusing him of lying over his squad absence against Arsenal in September 2023. Ten Hag had to swallow his pride, reintegrate Sancho during pre-season and play him in friendlies.",
      "Ten Hag handled the matter so tactfully that Sancho performed respectably during United's three-game tour of the States 12 months ago. At the end of it, Ten Hag even suggested Sancho could start the season up front in the absence of the injured Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "When Sancho emerged in the Community Shield last year, there were no boos. The days when United fans prided themselves on not booing the team or one of their own are long gone and they have been a recurring soundtrack in recent seasons. Sancho actually drew applause when he trudged to the penalty spot in the shootout.",
      "Amusingly, Sancho was not in the squad for the first Premier League game against Fulham. He travelled to Brighton eight days later and did not make the matchday cut, either. Then he was gone as Chelsea took him off United's hands, but only temporarily. It is regrettable Sancho outlasted Ten Hag, whose dwindling authority was harmed by the return of Sancho to the fold.",
      "A year on, Sancho is still marooned at United but not going on tour. When he was incongruously mentioned at a Ruben Amorim press conference in February, Amorim hardly acknowledged his existence. The chances are the two have never actually met.",
      "There is no resale value to preserve with Sancho and he belongs in the bomb squad. He has had a feckless four years at United, publicly challenged the manager and revelled in the \"freedom\" of Marcus Rashford's loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "One of the benefits of the profitability and sustainability rules is that they calculate a player's worth and effectively set a ballpark figure for a prospective transfer. Sancho is not worth much: £14.58million.",
      "Interested clubs are not daft, either. They were not going to cough up more millions if Sancho tore it up in the Premier League Summer Series for United in the States.",
      "The senior players who have travelled with United to Chicago could all feasibly be in the squad after the transfer window closes at 7pm on September 1. Accommodating Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia would have raised more questions than answers.",
      "It also tallies with the unequivocal backing United are showing Amorim. Garnacho is up for sale a year after he was deemed unsellable as he has crossed the manager one time too many.",
      "There was an argument for Amorim to compromise with Garnacho. Yes, Garnacho is hot-headed, his brother is a nuisance and he reckons he is the finished article, yet he is a winger with a world-class ceiling and one developed by United. If the mythical United Way is such a thing, Garnacho embodies it on the pitch with his flair and industry. He does not go into hiding.",
      "Off it is another matter altogether. He can be inattentive, aloof, puerile and confrontational. He tested Ten Hag on a couple of occasions, the first time as far back as his first tour in 2022.",
      "A United manager's leniency should only stretch so far. Garnacho was Ten Hag's academy legacy. Amorim has inherited him and the system he swears by was always liable to rub Garnacho up the wrong way. The irony is Garnacho made a decent fist of operating as an infield winger.",
      "But zoning out during a tactical briefing, skulking down the tunnel after dubiously being substituted and then questioning the manager's selection (even if he did have a point about Mason Mount starting ahead of him in the Europa League final) was unedifying. United cannot allow the manager's authority to erode by keeping a player who doesn't want to be there.",
      "Which is what they did with Pogba.",

      "Andre Onana's status as the first-choice goalkeeper at Manchester United is safe for now.",
      "Onana suffered a hamstring injury after reporting for pre-season at Carrington, but he has responded well to initial treatment and travelled with the squad to the United States.",
      "The 29-year-old will continue his recovery in the States and could return in time to feature in the opening Premier League game of the season against Arsenal on August 17. United might have signed a new goalkeeper by that stage, but the chances of a new arrival immediately usurping Onana are slim.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been open to signing a goalkeeper to challenge Onana for his starting role for some time, and the profile of any goalkeeper signing will give clues on Onana's future.",
      "United have been linked with Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but United are unlikely to make a move for the experienced Argentina international when Onana is still at the club.",
      "Moving to sign a capable understudy, a goalkeeper who could eventually replace Onana, would be the most practical and cost-effective option this summer. Many fans would like to see Onana sold and replaced by a proven goalkeeper, but he has prepared for the new season under the assumption he is staying.",
      "With that in mind, it hasn't been a surprise to see United linked with Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, 23, who has just a single full season of senior football under his belt.",
      "Lammens was impressive for Royal Antwerp in 2024/25, keeping seven clean sheets in 30 league starts, and he possesses the right profile to arrive in Manchester with the view of challenging Onana.",
      "The Belgian was asked about interest from United in February and told GVA: \"Wow, [it's] hard to say. I've only played one full season at Antwerp.",
      "\"If something comes along that I can hardly say no to and that will benefit the club, I'll have to think about it seriously. But if I'm the first 'keeper here for another year, that's no problem.",
      "\"The first time I heard it, I thought. 'Wow, a world team that follows you. That is special'. Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that. Funny, I would do it the other way around too. But you can't dwell on it for too long. They are still just rumours.",
      "\"Those top clubs have so many scouts and follow so many players. So it doesn't have to mean anything yet. It will only become clear in the summer whether anything comes of it.",
      "\"But of course it's only positive. Especially because it's the best competition in the world and my profile – my stature and way of playing – is similar to English football. You have to physically hold your own there and that suits me.",

      "The reports linking Lammens with a move to Old Trafford have picked up again this summer, although he would be a longer-term project and wouldn't immediately start games.",
      "Lammens could be signed as an eventual Onana replacement, but he has limited senior football experience, and it would be unrealistic for him to start regularly in the Premier League after signing.",
      "United fans would be delighted to see a new goalkeeper brought in this summer due to concerns about Onana, however, the Cameroon international looks set to retain his starting role.",
      "If Lammens signed for United, he would be given opportunities in cup competitions, and he would hope to deliver strong performances to build a case for starting in the Premier League.",
      "Onana is guaranteed to make mistakes and the second-choice goalkeeper, whoever that may be, could sense an opening.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has reacted to the announcement of Marcus Rashford leaving Manchester United on loan for the season.",
      "Rashford, 27, was confirmed to have joined Barcelona on Wednesday. He will spend the entirety of the 2025/26 campaign at the Nou Camp before the La Liga champions mull over an option to buy included in this latest summer deal.",
      "The winger made a joint post with his new club to Instagram as part of the transfer's announcement, which has been liked by over two million people in just over an hour.",
      "A number of United stars were among those to like the social media post with Bruno Fernandes, David de Gea, Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro and most poignantly Garnacho liking said post. The Argentinian, 21, also left a comment for his departing United teammate that read: \"Lets goooooo (Two salute emojis).\"",
      "Garnacho celebrating Rashford's loan exit also comes at a time where is future at United is uncertain. At the same time Rashford was first removed from Ruben Amorim's squad last December, Garnacho too was also dropped.",
      "Though the youngster was able to return, at the end of the challenging 2024/25 campaign his relationship with the manager broke down again.",
      "Returning for pre-season both wingers, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia were instructed not to be on the premises at the same time as the United first team at their Carrington training complex.",
      "Rashford is the first of that quintet to have found a route to another club, so the onus is on the rest to follow suit.",
      "Garnacho's representatives have rejected outside assistance to facilitate a move for their client. The player's latest activity has been to post a video of his individual training on social media while being linked with numerous clubs himself.",
      "He may share a similar sentiment to Rashford, who at his Barca unveiling said: \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while.",
      "\"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",
      "\"Football is the same as life. Not everything goes as simple as you may have thought. This is my next step and next chapter. I'm fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I don't have anything to say about Manchester United, I just wish them all the best and I hope they are successful in the future. I'm focused on here and I'm ready to play, I'm ready to experience this club.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has finally completed his £70million move to United from Brentford - putting an end to months of speculation around the Cameroon international's future. Mbeumo was United's second signing of the summer and third overall with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Ruben Amorim will hope to have Cunha and Mbeumo available for pre-season for the rest of the summer before their return to Premier League action next term. United will begin the campaign on August 17, at home to Arsenal, where Mbeumo and Cunha will be aiming to be in the starting line-up.",
      "However, another position in the United squad continues to be the subject of speculation. Despite having Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund in their ranks, United are continuing to be linked with signing a striker.",
      "A fresh update from The Mirror has reported, however, that United do not expect to sign a new centre forward anytime soon. In fact, the report has claimed that United are set to be without a new striker being signed before the opening weekend clash against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "United have been linked with a host of strikers this summer, including Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea, Victor Osimhen of Napoli and Randal Kolo Muani of Paris Saint-Germain. There was interest in Liam Delap before the centre forward went on to join Chelsea instead, while Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres have also been mentioned as potential targets over the last few weeks.",
      "It remains to be seen where United will turn this summer in the race to sign a new striker. The report adds that United are looking to players with Premier League experience as part of their CV, but who they will lead to the club targeting remains unclear at this stage.",

      "Manchester United are expected to send Ethan Wheatley and Radek Vitek out on loan this summer.",
      "Wheatley, 19, and Vitek, 21, have outgrown academy football and weren't named in the USA tour squad.",
      "The two players need to be playing regular football for the next stage of their development. Wheatley signed for Walsall on loan last season, but the young striker made just four appearances for the League Two club and ended a frustrating campaign by playing for United's Under-21s again.",
      "Academy staff have high hopes for Wheatley and he was handed a new three-year contract in March, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Wheatley featured for England at the Under-19 European Championship this summer, scoring twice in two starts. The youngster reported to Carrington late after an extended break and was not named in the travelling squad to face Leeds in the opening pre-season friendly last weekend.",
      "United will be conscious of arranging the right loan for Wheatley after his experience with Walsall, which the academy graduate admitted was \"frustrating\" in an interview with PA Sport.",
      "\"I’m just more concentrated on this tournament,\" he said. \"But yeah, since Ruben Amorim came in, I was away with international camp and, obviously, went on loan in January, so I’ve not really been around it too much.",
      "\"But I want to be a Man United player in the future. If that doesn’t happen, then it obviously wasn’t meant to be. We’ll just see what happens in the future.\"",
      "Wheatley added: \"My second half of the season has been frustrating. Not being able to show what I’m about, really. But I think this tournament is the perfect way to do it. I think there’ll be a lot of eyes on it and, obviously, representing your country in a Euros, there’s not much better than that.",
      "\"It’ll be good to hopefully impress and, just for myself and for the team, play my part and do well. The club have been good with me. They’ve let me come back and play a few Under-21s games, just to keep my legs going, so it’s been good to be back at United, developing and getting game-time.",
      "\"Even if my first [loan move] didn’t go well - and it didn’t - I had it in the back of my head. And I was telling staff around the club, it’s not going to define me as a player.",
      "\"It’s not going to judge where I end up in the future. I think it’s just like a little blip in my early career and, hopefully, I can just bounce back from it going into next season.\"",
      "Despite limited appearances for Walsall, Wheatley was impressive when he played for the U21s at the end of the campaign, scoring three goals in the Premier League 2 play-offs.",
      "Wheatley made United history in April 2024 by becoming the 250th academy graduate to make his debut for the club, coming on from the bench against Sheffield United at Old Trafford.",
      "Vitek has not made his United debut, but his season-long loan with FC Blau-Weiß Linz was considered a success due to the number of starts he made in a competitive environment.",
      "The goalkeeper started almost every league game for the Austrian side. Vitek is set to leave on loan again and his United contract expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "Despite this, United are still being mentioned as a potential destination for Osimhen as they look to sign a new striker this summer. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are the current centre forwards in the squad and any striker signing would likely see their respective futures at Old Trafford cast into doubt.",
      "It remains to be seen if United have a genuine chance of signing Osimhen this summer, with reports suggesting a €75million (£65million) release clause in his contract at Napoli would be enough to trigger a departure. And if Ruben Amorim's side were to bring Osimhen to Old Trafford they may be faced with a dilemma in a few months time.",
      "United will have a busy season of Premier League football ahead of them, particularly over the festive period. Across December and January, they will face several important matches in the top flight with the potential for more in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "However, at the same time as these matches, the Africa Cup of Nations will also be taking place. Osimhen is highly likely to feature at the tournament for Nigeria, which will take place from December 21 up to January.",
      "Amorim's side will also face Newcastle, Wolves, Leeds, Burnley, and Manchester City while AFCON takes place, which could all be matches Osimhen would miss if Nigeria were to progress to the final.",

      "It is the he-said-she-said season. If we are to take Manchester United at face value, they beat Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United to the signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "One imagines some of those clubs would contest the strength of their interest in Mbeumo. Tottenham and Newcastle's was certainly genuine. So much so that. there were some typically theatrical reaction from sections of the latter at how United could possibly afford Mbeumo.",
      "Thomas Frank's switch from Brentford to Spurs prompted a sudden and serious approach. Mbeumo cherishes Frank for helping him to develop into one of the most productive forwards in the Premier League but he was set on joining United.",
      "A United source said Mbeumo \"never budged\". United did not budge when Brentford demanded an up-front fee of at least £70million. Having gone the entirety of last summer without breaking the £60m barrier for a signing, the no-go figure has been upped to £70m this summer.",
      "There was a pro and con of Matheus Cunha's release clause. It made his signing swift and straightforward for United but also raised the price of Mbeumo, such a similar profile of player he was born only a few months later. The Cameroon international has played twice as long in the Premier League and scored five more league goals last term. He is also slightly younger. On those counts, he is arguably a more valuable asset.",
      "But United have got the two prime targets for their positions. They have remained coy on Mbeumo's specific role but it is unlikely to be up front. Club sources were careful not to bill them as their \"top two targets\", mindful of the need for a new goalscorer.",
      "That said, United were keen to highlight that only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins - four strikers - have scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in the past three years. Whatever the mitigation of such a stat, it is a genuinely impressive return from a winger who was operating at a stable mid-table side.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are not statement signings. United prised the best players from Brentford and Wolves. But they are statements of intent.",
      "Only seven players tallied more league goals than Cunha last season. Salah, Haaland and Isak were the three above Mbeumo in the charts. The clear caveat is that it will be trickier for the pair to match their goals hauls at the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "Arsenal were in for Cunha in the winter transfer window and at least two Champions League qualifiers wanted Mbeumo. United believe committing £133.5m on two signings reiterates their football first approach, an old line that they are still prone to trotting out.",
      "More significant is United retain some clout even after their worst season in 51 years. Yes, they moved for convenient targets at clubs lower down the food chain but there was concrete competition.",
      "Mbeumo is arguably more of a coup than Cunha, whose ill-discipline was a deterrent for some admirers. Mbeumo's character seems sound and he could have had an easier life, staying in London, reuniting with Frank and playing in the Champions League for Tottenham.",
      "A close relative of Mbeumo's is a United fan. Mbeumo revealed United was \"the team whose shirt I wore growing up\" in his unveiling statement. That may convince undecided fans to get 'Mbeumo 19' on the back of their new replica.",
      "There is a more bullish tone about United this summer. Twelve months ago, every significant decision that was taken during pre-season revolved around the manager and posed more questions than it answered.",
      "Keeping Erik ten Hag having looked to sack him and extending his contract rather than offering a renewal undermined the club's apparent confidence. Anyone who could see the wood for the trees could see United had gone past the point of no return under Ten Hag before they punched above their weight in the FA Cup final.",
      "The irony is Ruben Amorim presided over a Premier League finish that was almost twice as bad as Ten Hag's in 2023-24. Yet Amorim is Ineos' man. Amorim has seen off Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho amid unequivocal backing. You can count Dan Ashworth, too, given he was opposed to the choice of Amorim as head coach and favoured a British option.",
      "This is Amorim's first full season and he will not be afforded anywhere near as much slack as he was during those months when United prioritised the Europa League at the cost of their domestic form. There have been substantial squad investments in time for the pre-season tour and an XI with Mbeumo, Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Leny Yoro, Harry Maguire and Amad has to climb the league table.",
      "The squad is still short of a proven goalscorer, there is a potential midfield minefield if that area is not enhanced, and Andre Onana does not instil confidence in the majority of supporters. The transfer window is open for just under six more weeks and at least one more starting signing is targeted. That has to be a number nine.",
      "For now, they have Mbeumo with the '9' in his squad number, drawing envious glances from north London and Tyneside.",

      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has previously heaped praise on Reds-linked striker Ollie Watkins.",
      "The England international reportedly grew dissatisfied at Aston Villa last season, having fallen behind United loanee Marcus Rashford in the pecking order. After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season with a 2-0 loss to United, Watkins is said to be open to exploring new opportunities.",
      "United have reportedly initiated preliminary discussions with Villa about signing Watkins, as head coach Ruben Amorim views him as an ideal player to spearhead his attack, given his proven goal-scoring ability. The Villans are reportedly demanding around £60million but United are said to be reluctant to meet this valuation due to his age and limited resale value.",
      "The Reds reportedly proposed including Rashford in a swap deal for Watkins, but Villa declined the opportunity to sign the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan spell ended. Rashford is now closing in on a loan move to Barcelona instead.",
      "According to The Mirror, a potential obstacle in United's pursuit of the England international is their inability to offer European football following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in May.",
      "But if they can convince Watkins that a switch to United is the right move, former Reds midfielder Keane has already given his approval for the transfer.",
      "“Villa are a top team but you’re talking about bigger clubs in Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City. That’s a compliment to him, not that he has to leave Villa. But he’s capable of doing it.”",
      "Speaking about his form in 2023/24, Keane added: “The kid is so sharp, he has a great shape to him. His movement is as good as any striker in the Premier League. He’s having an amazing season.\"",

      "Manchester United completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford on Monday in a deal that could eventually be worth up to £71million.",
      "Following several weeks of negotiations, United reached a breakthrough with the Bees on Friday, agreeing to pay a fixed fee of £65million, plus a further £6m in performance-related add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a sixth, and could make his unofficial debut for the Reds when they face West Ham United in their opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States for this weekend.",
      "The Cameroonian, 25, scored 20 Premier League goals last season. He will also add a degree of versatility amid his capability out wide and through the middle.",
      "Just exactly where Ruben Amorim plans to deploy Mbeumo remains to be seen, but he is a contender to start at either right wing-back or as the right-sided No.10.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has picked out two winners and two losers of his United arrival.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "With a new striker yet to have been sourced, United are looking increasingly likely to have to rely on Hojlund this pre-season. The Dane started Saturday's 0-0 draw against Leeds United on the bench before being introduced for the second half.",
      "Hojlund has not had a full pre-season at United since arriving from Atalanta almost two years ago, being signed after the pre-season tour in 2023 and getting injured in the first game of last year's. He will be itching to have a good pre-season to boost his chances of starting the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo being added to the ranks, Hojlund has two creators that are set to be unleashed in Amorim's first-choice starting XI. Both Cunha and Mbeumo are architects that come alive inside the final third.",
      "While they should help ease the burden on Hojlund's shoulders to score the goals, their presence could boost his chances of becoming more fruitful in front of goal. He needs to make the most of this tour.",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Wherever Amorim tasks Fernandes with playing, he is guaranteed to make his mark. He has been United's best signing of the post Sir Alex Ferguson era and he has stepped up on countless occasions when others have failed to.",
      "Following the capture of Cunha earlier this summer, the general feeling has been that Fernandes will start the upcoming campaign in the centre of midfield. He started the clash with Leeds in the engine room, with Toby Collyer preferred as the right-sided No.10.",
      "Despite being set to make a permanent switch to midfield, Fernandes will still want to contribute goals and assists - and there is no doubt he will. His purple patch in March, after transitioning to the centre of midfield, proved that.",
      "Nevertheless, the additions of Cunha and now Mbeumo will ease the burden on the United skipper.",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Despite being a firm favourite of Amorim's, Mbeumo's arrival could limit Mount's game time - if the Cameroonian is deployed as a No.10.",
      "United already had a healthy number of options to occupy that role and Mbeumo's addition only risks decreasing the game time of others. Mbeumo and Amad are the leading contenders to occupy the right-sided No.10 spot and the loser of that particular battle is likely to be deployed at right wing-back.",
      "That leaves Mount to potentially settle for a place on the bench. With no European football on offer this season, rotation is not going to be as forthcoming.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "After being drafted in last summer to compete with Hojlund to spearhead United's attack, it soon became evident that Zirkzee is not a natural striker. His ability to drop deep and collect possession in pockets of space means he is better as a No.10.",
      "The Dutchman was offered the chance to flex his muscles as a playmaker in the second half of last term and his performances did improve when deployed deeper. With a new striker being targeted, his primary position is set to remain the attacking-midfield berth, but increased competition could push him down the order.",

      "United, following several weeks of negotiations, finally reached a breakthrough last Friday, agreeing a deal that could eventually be worth up to £71million. The Reds will pay a fixed fee of £65m, plus £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has become the club's third signing of the summer, following on from the additions of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, and will be determined to hit the ground running at Old Trafford after scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last term.",
      "And with United due to spend just under a fortnight in the US, Mbeumo is hopeful that period of time with his teammates will help him adjust, both on and off the pitch.",
      "Mbeumo told MUTV: \"Yes, I think it is really important for me joining a new club. It is important to create links as soon as possible, automatism as well with the teammates in and out of the pitch.",
      "\"As I said, the spirit is really important. Yes, creating a group and being involved as soon as possible for me, it's something really important.\"",
      "United have prioritised attacking signings this summer after finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. By recruiting Cunha and Mbeumo, they have added two players who netted 35 league goals last term. And Mbeumo is confident Cunha will make his mark at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Obviously, I watched him play a lot with Wolves,\" Mbeumo said of his new teammate. \"I know he's a very good player and I'm sure he's going to bring something new in the team.\"",

      "Manchester United have ‘opened talks’ with a Ligue 1 teen while Joshua Zirkzee taps up one of his former teammates amid interest from the Red Devils.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "The Athletic’s Ornstein confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for RB Leipzig’s Sesko, Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson in their search for a new No.9.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "Sesko is thought to be their top target and is ‘open’ to the move to Old Trafford even without European football, with RB Leipzig said to be ready to listen to offers of around £60m for the Slovenian.",
      "But the Red Devils are spreading the net wide and it’s now claimed that Bologna star Dan Ndoye and Metz teenager Idrissa Gueye are also in the frame for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "L’Equipe report Gueye ‘could take a sharp acceleration during the summer’ and leave the club after helping them to promotion from Ligue 2 last season.",
      "The 18-year-old got five goals and an assist having broken into the first team in January but ‘should fly to a new club’ this summer’, with Metz wanting €20m [£17.3m], though it’s claimed they would listen to offers of around €15m [£13m].",
      "Southampton, West Ham and Wolves are all credited with interest, but both Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund have reportedly ‘entered into discussions with his entourage’.",
      "Ndoye has agreed personal terms over a move to Nottingham Forest, who are expected to return with a second bid for the 24-year-old after their opening offer of €30m [£24.4m] was rejected by Bologna, but United could yet hijack his transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with the right winger for some time and Italian outlet Il Resto del Carlino claim they’ve agin ‘made contact’ over a move for Ndoye and are considering an offer of €40m [£34.6m].",
      "The report adds that United forward Joshua Zirkzee, who moved to Old Trafford from Bologna for £34.5m last summer, has had ‘telephone contact’ with his former teammate to encourage him to join him in Manchester.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are also keen on Ndoye, and they too are said to have agreed personal terms.",
      "Man Utd have reignited their interest in a £34m Serie A star to replace Alejandro Garnacho, who ‘wants to leave’ after the Europa League final defeat."

      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Manchester United.",
      "Rashford has joined on an initial 12-month loan from Manchester United, with the Catalan giants holding the option of signing him on a permanent basis for £30.3m (35m euros) in 2026.",
      "Barcelona will cover the entirety of Rashford’s wages during his time at the club after the forward agreed to take a pay cut, with United set to save around £15m with him removed from the wage bill.",
      "“I feel at home here; it’s a very family-oriented club,” Rashford said at his unveiling. “I always try to make decisive, quick, and dynamic moves, and I’ve always loved good football. That’s why, since I was little, I’ve loved watching Barca, just like all football fans.",
      "“They won a ton of titles last year, and I can see they’re ambitious to win more this year, very excited. I think it’s a club every player wants to play for. They’ve made me feel at home in these first few hours; everyone has made me feel very comfortable.",
      "“One of the key reasons for me coming here was him (Hansi Flick), the conversation I had with him was very positive.",
      "“I’m eager to get started and learn from the ‘Barca method.’ He’s one of the great coaches. Last season, he did an incredible job with a young team, with many successes.",
      "“I thank the fans for the welcome and hope you enjoy it. It’s my first time here, and the first game will be a special moment.”",
      "Rashford hasn’t played for Manchester United since last December after being dropped by manager Ruben Amorin for the Manchester derby over what the Portuguese boss claimed to be a lack of effort in training.",
      "The England international spent the second half of the 2024-25 season on loan at Aston Villa, and looked to be back close to his best with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances for the Villans.",
      "Asked about leaving United, Rashford added: “The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while. So I don’t have anything bad to say about Manchester United… I wish them all the best and hope they are successful in the future.”",
      "The 27-year-old trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Tuesday and is expected to be included in the squad that travels to Japan for a pre-season tour of Asia on Thursday.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford should’ve departed Manchester United a hero. Instead, his exit prompts barely a shrug as he gambles on Barca levers…",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice."

      "Manchester United have been told what they will need to pay to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer after David Ornstein revealed the Red Devils have held ‘talks’ over the RB Leipzig star.",
      "United have turned their attention to a new No.9 having finally completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with the Cameroon international joining Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as the Red Devils’ new recruits this summer.",
      "A report last week claimed Sesko ‘wants Man Utd move’ despite the Red Devils being unable to offer European football to the Slovenia international.",
      "United are ‘understood to be admirers of Sesko’s all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League’ and the RB Leipzig star ‘would favour a move to Old Trafford over other destinations’.",
      "The Slovenian is ‘not the only name under consideration’ with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins and Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson also potential options.",
      "The report added that as Sesko is ‘open to the move and willing to forgo European football in the short term, United are weighing up whether to make a concrete push’.",
      "The Athletic‘s Ornstein then confirmed United have held ‘talks’ over a move for Sesko, along with Watkins and Jackson.",
      "Ornstein said: “United tried to enter the race for Hugo Ekitike last week, but the Eintracht Frankfurt attacker had committed to Liverpool. They then enquired to Sporting Lisbon about Viktor Gyokores, though the striker has made clear he is interested only in joining Arsenal, and United do not intend to advance on anyone unless the desire is mutual.",
      "“Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are names that feature on recruitment lists at many leading clubs, and each has recently been linked to United. Talks have taken place in relation to that trio, which is normal, but they are not currently being actively pursued due to the costs involved.”",
      "And now Bild journalist Christian Falk has revealed the price he believes United will have to pay to land Sesko, while also revealing the Red Devils hold a ‘key’ to his transfer after Arsenal walked away from their pursuit of the Slovenian as they close in on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "“When one door closes, another opens! Arsenal have withdrawn their pursuit of Benjamin Šeško, which creates an opportunity for Manchester United,” Falk told CaughtOffside.",
      "“The Red Devils weren’t in the front row for the club and player. However, there’s a key executive involved in all of this – Christopher Vivell, United’s head of scouting. He’s previously worked for RB Leipzig, and he’s now supporting the potential deal. Vivell’s also been watching the situation develop since April. He was at the match between Leipzig and Wolfsburg to scout Šeško again.",
      "“The striker (22) is still very, very young. He can leave with a good offer; I think Leipzig are willing to talk if they receive a fee closer to €70m [£60.6m].”",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool signings have received the ‘Here we go’, which has opened the door for new faces to get into our top 10 available strikers ranking.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the three strikers Man Utd have held ‘talks’ about after also enquiring over Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Premier League giants Man Utd are now getting serious in their pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, according to reports."

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Rodri – Man City to Real Madrid\nWe’re told that Real are offering Eduardo Camavinga, Rodrygo and €40million for Rodri. Real probably value that package at around £170million. Which feels like a lot for a player coming off the back of a serious knee injury. But probably still not enough for City to seriously consider.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Ezri Konsa – Aston Villa to Liverpool\nA report in Spain suggests Liverpool could alter their focus to the ‘slightly more affordable’ Konsa since Palace are looking for £50million to sell Marc Guehi a year before he goes for free. Konsa is under contract until 2028 – would Villa demand less for him than what Palace are demanding for Guehi? We think not.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool are monitoring Rodrygo if Luis Diaz leaves. The Reds are insisting on top whack for Diaz, who is set to be the subject of an improved offer from Bayern. Real too were looking for around £86million for Rodrygo but they have since accepted they may have to settle for less. In that context, it makes sense but still somehow doesn’t pass the sniff test.",

      "",
      "17) 🆕 Kobbie Mainoo – Manchester United to Tottenham\nSpurs have made an enquiry to United over Mainoo, whose contract talks with his boyhood club are not progressing as quickly as either side might hope. That shouldn’t prompt panic, though, since the midfielder’s current terms expire in 2027 and United have the option to go for another 12 months beyond that. Still, does Mainoo fit Ruben Amorim’s system? He might be their best chance of getting some decent money in this summer.",
      "",
      "16) 🔼 Anthony Gordon – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt’s been pretty quiet around Gordon so far this summer, but it seems someone is trying to drum up the noise. We all know he would probably walk to Anfield to join Liverpool, so most likely the stirring is being done by the those close to the player. Which might do the trick since the Reds will be on the lookout for a replacement should they get big money from Bayern for Luis Diaz. This feels more likely than Liverpool going for Rodrygo.",
      "",
      "15) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Manchester United\nUnited continue to be linked with Jackson but we hear that Chelsea have valued him at between £80million and £100million. If you’re not going to take it seriously, lads. We could see this happening, probably late and something exchange-y involving Alejandro Garnacho. But not if Chelsea keep pretending they want the silliest of money.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho is being linked with Chelsea and Spurs but the noise seems to be building around Villa. Morgan Rogers to Chelsea, then Garnacho to Villa? The Villans would turn a profit from any such dealing and if they sit tight, they could get Garnacho for even less than the current asking price of around £40million. If they are really clever, they could probably get him on loan.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seemed as though Liverpool were taking Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead doused our initial suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak. But it all seemed a bit weird on Saturday when Isak was sent home from Glasgow ‘due to the speculation around him’ and Eddie Howe sounded less convincing that the Swede would remain with Newcastle beyond the end of the window. Maybe this one isn’t done?",
      "",
      "12) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nIt was thought Xhaka might be heading for the riches of Saudi but instead he fancies the splendour of Sunderland. Indeed, the ex-Arsenal midfielder has told Leverkusen he only wants to move to the Stadium of Light while urging the German club to do a deal quickly. Those pleas, though, appear to have fallen on deaf ears, with Erik ten Hag insisting Leverkusen have already lost too many key players this summer.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao but the sales of Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah will allow the Old Lady to sign Sancho too. Agreements are said to be in place with both United and Sancho, who should be thanking his lucky stars even if he’s halving his salary. How will he cope?",
      "",
      "7) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. Only problem now is they need to deal with Brentford, who have already lost one forward to Manchester United. Given the Bees know Newcastle were prepared to spend big on Hugo Ekitike or Joao Pedro, the Magpies can expect a rough ride. They will have to try a lot harder than £25million.",
      "",
      "6) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nThis one doesn’t seem to have moved in since Forest saw their arse over Spurs randomly plucking the same number out of the sky that appears on Gibbs-White contract under the buy-out clause. Forest threatened legal action and since then… nothing. The player is missing from Forest’s pre-season trip to Portugal but that’s to stay behind with his heavily pregnant partner. What now? For this to go through, Spurs must suss that they are legally on solid ground and pursue the deal at the cost of their original offer; or they sweeten the deal for Forest to sell a player who wants to move.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nWe all assumed Newcastle would pull their finger out after their initial bid of £27million inclusive of add-ons was rejected last month. Since then, though: nothing. Leaving City to swoop in for the England Under-21 keeper. Reports suggest City are trying to secure a discount on the £40million buy-back clause they hold for their ex-goalkeeper but with the increased noise around Ederson departing, it’s hard to envisage the Citizens allowing Newcastle back into the race.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nAfter bemoaning the abject lack of progress in the last week, it seems we finally have some. Ornstein reckons Sporting and Arsenal are ‘on the verge of total agreement’. Which is where we thought they were but, apparently, a ‘conclusion is imminent’. Which is something we can all be thankful for.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nThe delay between medical and confirmation is a pattern with Arsenal this summer but this one has really dragged. Mosquera is heading for Singapore to join his new team-mates but still we wait.",

      "9) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal – £123.7m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Joao Palhinha could be heading back to the Premier League just one year after leaving it, with one new suitor joining the race according to Florian Plettenberg, and Bayern Munich ready to listen to offers.",
      "The Portugal international endured a frustrating debut season in Germany, making only six Bundesliga starts for the title winners and watching on as others took precedence in Vincent Kompany’s midfield.",
      "His move from Fulham last summer came after a collapsed deadline-day switch the previous year, and while the eventual £46.5million deal got over the line, the fit never quite did.",
      "Palhinha recently admitted his first year in Bavaria had been “difficult” during tentative links to Arsenal, though he reaffirmed his commitment to return for pre-season and prove himself.",
      "Man Utd are allegedly one of the clubs considering a move. New boss Ruben Amorim worked with Palhinha during their time together at Sporting and Braga, and reports suggest the 30-year-old is being lined up to provide a defensive anchor that would allow Bruno Fernandes more attacking freedom.",
      "Amorim’s midfield was one of the biggest concerns last season, and while much of Utd transfer focus has been on forwards, a move for Palhinha could be the next domino.",
      "However, Utd are believed to be exploring a loan, while Bayern are reportedly pushing back against any temporary deal with the Bundesliga season fast approaching.",
      "MORE TOTTENHAM COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Florian Plettenberg clears up Rodrygo to Tottenham talk amid Arsenal and Liverpool interest\n👉 Tottenham: Gibbs-White told to ‘sue’ Forest amid ‘disgrace’ as two reasons for ‘very likely’ outcome\n👉 Tottenham ‘ready to pay’ £61m in PSG hijack as Liverpool ‘offered’ Bournemouth exchange target",
      "Fulham have also been credited with an interest in bringing Palhinha back. The Cottagers sold him for a club-record fee but are are also said to be eyeing a loan deal as part of a wider rebuild under Marco Silva.",
      "The west London club are targeting up to five signings and view Palhinha as a potential marquee return, should Bayern allow it.",
      "But the Germans would prefer a permanent exit and are said to have made that clear in talks with interested parties, according to reports.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur have now entered the picture, with Sky Germany’s Florian Plettenberg revealing that the north London club are monitoring the situation.",
      "“It is not concrete at this stage, but there is interest,” he posted on X. “Palhinha’s camp has been informed. Bayern are open to talks should suitable offers arrive for the 30 y/o.”",
      "Spurs have already been active this summer with deals for Mohamed Kudus, Mathys Tel and Kevin Danso, but midfield reinforcements have so far taken a back seat.",
      "Palhinha would offer something different to Yves Bissouma, Rodrigo Bentancur and Pape Matar Sarr, as a pure ball-winner with a track record of excelling in the Premier League and Champions League experience to match.",
      "Tottenham will be given a challenge in their pursuit of a Bayern Munich star as his former side are reportedly ‘determined’ to bring him back on board.",
      "Tottenham will reportedly ‘need’ to do one thing before they can secure the signing of a Bayern Munich star who they have been looking at for a while.",
      "Bayern Munich midfielder Joao Palhinha has spoken out amid reports crediting Arsenal with an interest in the Portgual international.",
      "Arsenal have walked away from deals to sign Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Bayern Munich defensive midfielder Joao Palhinha, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting three central midfielders as their ‘next priority’ if and when they finally complete a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Arsenal and Liverpool have received the Fabrizio Romano ‘Here we go’ for new striker signings, while Victor Osimhen’s move to Galatasaray has opened the door for new faces to get into our top 10 available centre-forwards ranking.",
      "We also have the best available attacking midfielders, centre-backs, wingers, and defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "10) Lois Openda (Leipzig)\nAfter missing out on Champions League football, Leipzig are expected to make two or three important sales this summer. The best available attacking midfielder and Chelsea target, Xavi Simons, is the most likely as things stand, and Openda could follow his teammate out the door.",
      "After scoring 21 goals in 38 Ligue 1 matches in 2022/23, Openda earned a well-deserved transfer to the Bundesliga, and 24 goals and seven assists in his maiden campaign was a very promising return.",
      "Last season was less convincing from the Belgian, and every other Leipzig player. Still, nine goals and nine assists is hardly rubbish.",
      "With Leipzig open to selling a key player or two, there should be some clubs keen on signing Openda.",
      "",
      "9) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nJackson divides opinion, but his Premier League record is far from terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good. A brace against West Ham last September put him on 17 non-penalty league goals for Chelsea, which was more than Mohamed Salah managed for Liverpool (16) since the African striker’s move from Villarreal a year earlier. He scored 14 and assisted five in 35 in 2023/24 and then recorded as many assists and 10 goals in 30 last term.",
      "Yes, Jackson is a big-chances-missed extraordinaire, but those numbers can’t be sniffed at. Clubs fighting for European football could do a lot worse, and the 24-year-old would also be a solid option for any foreign clubs that sell a striker on this list, including Leipzig.",
      "",
      "8) Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain)\nAfter a successful six-month loan at Juventus, Kolo Muani is likely to join the Italian giants permanently, or sign on loan for the entirety of 2025/26. Nothing is guaranteed though, and we could see the Frenchman move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Naturally, Manchester United are a solid option for Kolo Muani, while Newcastle are apparently in the picture. Aston Villa shouldn’t be ruled out either, having sent Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford and returned Marco Asensio to PSG.",
      "The Parisiens paid a whopping £80m for the 26-year-old in 2023 but he’s only managed 11 goals in 57 matches for them. He’s been a colossal flop but there’s still hope for Kolo Muani.",
      "MORE: Ten players in the Club World Cup shop window for Premier League scouts",
      "",
      "7) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\nThere are two significant numbers when it comes to Wissa: 29 and 19. The first is how old he turns on September 3, which might put off some clubs, while the other is his 2024/25 Premier League goal tally, which should be enough to put any age reservations to bed.",
      "Brentford don’t want to lose Wissa after selling Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, and are in a strong financial situation after earning £65m for the Cameroonian a year after getting £27m for David Raya and £40m for Ivan Toney. Somehow though, Craig Hope reckons the Bees will accept ‘a fee in the region of £30m’.",
      "If that’s true, we should see Wissa holding up a Newcastle United top in no time.",
      "",
      "6) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nOn a list containing two Leipzig players, here is a former Leipzig player. During his time in Germany, Nkunku tore up the Bundesliga, recording a ridiculous 90 goal contributions in 119 league games.",
      "The Frenchman has been unable to replicate that form at Chelsea, with an early injury making it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino’s team, which then contributed to a lack of Premier League minutes under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Despite his underwhelming Blues stint, Nkunku is an incredible market opportunity. There is talk of Newcastle targeting him after missing out on Blues signing Joao Pedro and Liverpool-bound youngster Hugo Ekitike, though their current focus is the aforementioned Wissa.",
      "Like Wissa, Nkunku can play anywhere in attack, but unlike Wissa, he is also capable of operating in an attacking midfield role. If he’s available for under £40m, there should be a long queue of potential suitors.",
      "",
      "5) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nThe Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him. But who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Napoli were very interested but showed no intention of paying £60m and signed Lorenzo Lucca instead, so the Reds are now anxiously hoping a Saudi Arabian club offers big bucks for Darwin.",
      "Darwin is only 26, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leave a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk, but the potential reward is big. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere. We think.",

      "",
      "4) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him – it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are going a lot better than the Old Lady.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70m signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move. He’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "3) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nVictor Boniface could be part of a summer exodus at Bayer Leverkusen, but head coach Erik ten Hag has said there have already been too many sales since his arrival. That spells bad news for Sunderland target Granit Xhaka.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "2) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which is a similar mark against his name as Brentford’s Wissa. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of late panic. Probably from Manchester United.",
      "",
      "1) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nPredicting Benjamin Sesko’s future is essentially pointless at this stage.",
      "There is a lot of hype surrounding the young Slovenian and a move to Arsenal looked likely before they prioritised Viktor Gyokeres. Now, it’s anyone’s guess where he’ll be playing next season. Manchester United have been linked but need sales before even considering bidding for him, while Saudi Arabian champions Al Hilal have tried and failed already this summer.",
      "Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite forward, but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could become the best striker in the world.",
      "",
      "Man Utd have been told what they will need to pay to sign Benjamin Sesko this summer after David Ornstein revealed the Red Devils have held ‘talks’ over the RB ...",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now moving to seal their next two signings this summer after getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line on Monday.",
      "While selling clubs prepare a wedge of Man Utd tax to put on their strikers, we’ve entered the mind of Ruben Amorim to rank their top ten targets.",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the three strikers Man Utd have held ‘talks’ about after also enquiring over Hugo Ekitike and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Premier League giants Man Utd are now getting serious in their pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, according to reports."

Other clubs know United’s position. They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers.",
      "“I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment. The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it. They’ll probably take anything from a quarter to a fifth of their asking price for some of them.”",

      "Martin Zubimendi makes bizarre claim after turning down £51m Liverpool transfer – ‘the best decision’",
      "There’s a lot of feigned bewilderment at the idea Zubimendi didn’t feel ready to leave Real Sociedad 12 months ago but is more comfortable with it now, as well as indignant bafflement at the idea Arsenal gave PSG a tougher test in the Champions League than Liverpool (although of course he never actually mentions Liverpool here).",
      "But our favourite bit is this.",

      "",
      "10) Mario Gila (Lazio)\nA player going under the radar in Serie A is Lazio defender Gila. The uncapped Spaniard turns 25 in August and is under contract at the Stadio Olimpico until 2027, so there is likely some degree of willingness to sell this summer.",
      "Lazio picked him up from Real Madrid for around £5million in July 2022, and he’s gone on to play 84 times for the Italian giants, scoring two goals.",
      "Comfortable and confident on the ball, Gila is an astute defender and would be a top signing for any big club looking to bolster their defence.",
      "",
      "9) Ousmane Diomande (Sporting)\nThe Ivorian has previously been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham, but FA Cup winners Crystal Palace seem the most likely, even if that rumour has gone very quiet.",
      "Jarell Quansah’s move from Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen hasn’t quite triggered a transfer domino effect in the Premier League, though the Premier League champions have ramped up their pursuit of Palace captain Marc Guehi. No bid has been made or seems close, but if he leaves the Eagles, Oliver Glasner must get his replacement right. Diomande would be a coup and a safe option in that regard.",
      "READ: Palace should be ‘genuinely astounded’ by Arsenal, Liverpool part-exchange offers for Eze and Guehi",
      "",
      "8) Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)\nThere are question marks over two things: Scalvini’s availability and Scalvini’s injury record. One report from Italy says he is ‘unsellable’, but Fabrizio Romano claims Newcastle United want him and ‘more clubs are keen’, with Atalanta receiving ‘initial approaches’. That certainly sounds like he’s ‘sellable’ — but only for big, big money.",
      "The 21-year-old tore his ACL last June and was restricted to a mere eight appearances across all competitions in 2024/25, starting five times. After recovering from the serious knee injury, the young Italian was eased back in before suffering a shoulder injury in December, missing two games. He then injured the same shoulder in January and didn’t feature again for the rest of the season. That’s 42 games missed for Atalanta since the ACL injury 13 months ago.",
      "The potential is still there, but you can understand the reluctance to break the bank. If he wasn’t so unlucky with injuries, he’d be a lot higher here.",
      "",
      "7) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nAfter a season-ending injury to Gabriel Magalhaes on April Fool’s Day, Kiwior came into the Arsenal starting XI and did pretty well, staking a claim for a big-money transfer this summer – or more minutes for the Gunners in the Premier League.",
      "Knowing Arsenal, they’ll struggle to get £30m, but really ought to be demanding closer to £45m, especially if the aforementioned Quansah cost Leverkusen £35m. The fact Kiwior is left-footed surely adds £10m to his value too. Apparently, that’s the world we live in now.",
      "",
      "6) Antonio Silva (Benfica)\nChelsea and Manchester United are among the clubs to be linked with the Benfica defender, who apparently “wants Juventus”, per his agent Jorge Mendes.",
      "Benfica are known to be difficult negotiators, and talks over Silva will likely be no exception. He’s expected to be the next big-money sale after ex-Red Devils youngster Alvaro Carreras joined Real Madrid earlier this summer.",

The most stunning transfer coups made by newly-promoted Premier League clubs",
      "",
      "5) Goncalo Inacio (Sporting)\nThere’s a £51m release clause in Inacio’s Sporting contract and Manchester United have been linked for a while – long before Ruben Amorim left the Portuguese club for Old Trafford. Amorim would surely push for his signing, but United are prioritising other positions and don’t have the financial flexibility to go big on a centre-back.",
      "Separating Inacio, Silva and Diomande wasn’t easy. I don’t watch Portuguese football too often…for my sins. But you don’t need to watch Sporting every week to know this boy is very good. With United surely out of the picture, it’s unclear where Inacio will end up. Maybe Liverpool will get involved if they can’t lure Guehi away from Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "4) Loic Bade (Sevilla)\nThere is some bias here, believe it or not. Bade was identified by yours truly as a centre-back for the future when he was playing in Ligue 2 with Le Havre, so it’s absolutely imperative that he gets a big transfer and becomes recognised as one of the best defenders in Europe.",
      "Bade did get a decent move to Rennes for £15m when he was 21, but it didn’t really happen for him there. Then came the bizarre Nottingham Forest loan that lasted four months and produced zero appearances. He’s found a home in Seville, though, and has been impressing for them since joining in January 2023, straight after leaving Forest.",
      "The French international helped Sevilla win the Europa League in his first six months and signed permanently for around £10m. He’s been a top signing and is ready for a proper crack at the Premier League.",
      "",
      "3) Carlos Lukeba (RB Leipzig)\nReal Madrid are one of the clubs being linked with the 22-year-old, which does a lot of the talking for us, really.",
      "There are high hopes for Lukeba, who hopefully doesn’t follow in the footsteps of another French Leipzig defender, Mohamed Simakan, by moving to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Newcastle clearly want a new centre-back but could be put off by Lukeba’s left-footedness, with a long-term Sven Botman partner the priority, though the Dutchman has proved to be very injury-prone. Liverpool could emerge as a very serious option with another French ex-Leipzig defender, Ibrahima Konate, being fiercely linked with Real Madrid.",
      "He has a €90m (£77.5m) release clause, which surely won’t be triggered this summer. It’ll be interesting to see Leipzig’s stance if offers come in, especially with Benjamin Sesko likely to stay.",
      "",
      "2) Edmond Tapsoba (Bayer Leverkusen)\nOn a list full of children, Tapsoba stands out as an old fogey, aged 26. There are younger options, but there aren’t many better. Plus he has the benefit of entering his prime years having proven himself in a wonderful team.",
      "The Burkina Faso defender played 46 times for Leverkusen in 2023/24, when they lost just once all season, in the Europa League final against Atalanta.",
      "He featured nine times in the Champions League and is clearly good enough to make the step up, if he so desires. Leverkusen are still a very good side, even without Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong; we wouldn’t blame him for staying.",
      "Transfer speculation has significantly died down, but all it takes is one Fabrizio Romano post on X, folks, and then every club is interested.",
      "",
      "1) Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)\nYou can argue about Guehi’s ‘availability’, but with a year left on his contract and interest from Premier League champions Liverpool, Crystal Palace should be open to selling their captain for the right price. Losing him on a free would be disastrous in the eyes of many, though there is a case for keeping him ahead of a Europa Conference League campaign. Is an extra year worth more than a potential £50m transfer fee?",

Jashari has made it clear that Milan is his preferred destination, but if negotiations with the Belgian club continue to stall, a move elsewhere can’t be ruled out. Given his stance, playing for Brugge again seems unlikely.",
      "Since making his international debut in September 2022, Jashari has earned four caps and is expected to play a more significant role for his national team once Granit Xhaka retires from international football.",
      "He’s a fantastic, young defensive midfielder with Champions League experience, having helped Brugge reach the last 16 of Europe’s premier competition last season. They lost to Aston Villa after an incredible 5-2 aggregate win over Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-off round.",
      "",
      "9) Angelo Stiller (Stuttgart)\nIt’s unlikely that Stiller leaves Stuttgart this summer, but as a standout performer outside of the Champions League spotlight, he could be tempted by a bigger move.",
      "The 24-year-old four-cap Germany international signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January, with Fabrizio Romano confirming that ‘several clubs’ wanted to sign him in the summer transfer window.",
      "Valued at €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, Stiller played 47 times across all competitions last season, assisting an impressive 11 times from defensive midfield.",
      "",
      "8) Douglas Luiz (Juventus)\nThe former Aston Villa midfielder left England to ease Profit and Sustainability pressures last summer. He had been superb in 2023/24, but his debut season in Italy was anything but.",
      "Injuries kept him in and out of the Juventus squad and, when fit, he failed to make himself undroppable. Consistency eluded him, in part due to a lack of rhythm, and he never really got going. We all know what Luiz is capable of, and there’s rumoured interest from the Premier League. Based on his Villa form, £30million – his reported asking price – could be a snip.",
      "",
      "7) Alan Varela (Porto)\nVarela is only 24 but still uncapped for Argentina, which is mildly baffling. He’s quietly become one of the best defensive midfielders in Portugal, and we expected more concrete interest from the continent by now.",
      "AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City have all been linked, but Porto aren’t in the mood to do business on the cheap, especially after tying him down to a five-year contract in May.",

      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Bayern Munich)\nOne of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League during his Fulham days, it just hasn’t happened for Palhinha at Bayern. He earned a deserved move last summer, but could be out the door again after just one season.",
      "Fulham didn’t suffer without him and Palhinha barely featured for Bayern, starting just nine matches in all competitions and failing to hit 1,000 minutes across the campaign. At 29, he might prefer to stick around at a club like Bayern, where he’s only an injury or two away (to other Bayern players, obviously) from regular minutes under Vincent Kompany.",
      "",
      "5) Morten Hjulmand (Sporting)\nViktor Gyokeres is the headline-grabber at Sporting, on and off the pitch, having forced a transfer to Arsenal, but Hjulmand is catching plenty of admiring glances of his own.",
      "The Danish international scored against England at Euro 2024, but it’s the rest of his game that’s got Europe’s elite taking notice. He’s now Sporting captain and, at 26, has the tools to become a world-class holding midfielder if he picks the right next step.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe may reluctantly sanction Mainoo’s sale this summer to fund a rebuild, but only for a suitably ridiculous fee. Chelsea have been linked, though they already have more young midfielders than minutes to give them.",
      "Mainoo was once untouchable at Old Trafford, but INEOS-era chaos has quickly changed that. It’s surprising that he hasn’t nailed down a role under Ruben Amorim – stylistically, he fits – but he’s not looked fully sharp this year.",
      "A quiet summer involving a bit of Italian culture could be exactly what he needs. Clubs should be circling, because United might just let their most gifted academy graduate in decades leave for the right price.",

Arsenal are reportedly sniffing around and need a bit more midfield depth following the exits of Jorginho and an unnamed Premier League footballer in his 30s.",
      "",
      "2) Carlos Baleba (Brighton)\nBrighton’s next mega-sale is likely to be Baleba, who’s quietly become one of the most complete young midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "Clubs might not think he’s worth £80m, but Brighton think he is, and they’re rarely wrong. They won’t sell for a penny less, either. They’re not quite Benfica levels of shrewd, but they’ve set the standard in England.",

      "Even if the deal suits the immediate needs of all involved, the details of the agreement that takes Marcus Rashford from Manchester United to Barcelona reflect well on none of the signatories.",
      "The two clubs are settling somewhat but Rashford, at least, has got what he really wanted and probably more than he deserves. In Catalonia right now, in between thanking his lucky stars, the 27-year-old is practising his keepie-uppies ahead of being officially unveiled as a Barca player.",
      "None of this is how Rashford should be leaving United. If you were told a couple of years ago that the academy graduate would be swapping Old Trafford for the Nou Camp, the expectation might have been for Rashford to be revered and waved off with the warmest wishes of everyone at his boyhood club, while United banked a massive fee following a decade of stellar service.",
      "Instead, after witnessing a couple of years of apathy, most Stretford End-ers will shrug wearily while Rashford becomes the chief beneficiary of Barca’s financial ineptitude that made their primary targets unattainable.",
      "Doubtless, some of United’s online fanbase will be somewhat more animated. Many of Paul Pogba’s loons latched on to Rashford as the subject of their fanaticism and, to them, the player could no wrong. It’s always the manager at Manchester United.",
      "The truth is, for the breakdown of the bond between Rashford and United, there is plenty of blame to go around.",
      "Rashford can be excused a good deal of frustration over how his boyhood club was run for the most of the nine years since he burst into Louis van Gaal’s first-team. Too often in that time, he was one of the few certainties among the chaos and, as a local academy graduate, a throwback to the values United still claim to represent.",
      "As recently as two years ago, Rashford looked set to cement a hero’s legacy at United when he became the first player in the post-Ferguson era to score 30 goals in a season.",
      "Then he just seemed to get sick of it. All of it.",
      "You would have to be an extreme optimist to view as a mere coincidence the peak of Rashford’s performance coming around contract renewal time. Almost as soon as the ink was dry on a £325,000-a-week deal, Rashford’s form and focus vanished – only to be rediscovered this summer when it became clear that Barca might be an option after all.",
      "Perhaps only Rashford and those closest to him really understand what happened, but to many outsiders looking in, the love was gone. First for United, then football. Whatever might have been going on in his mind, he just looked thoroughly fed up with his lot.",
      "On the pitch, even pretending to press became too much of a chore. In possession, the blinkers narrowed. Not as they tend to on the most ruthless of marksmen; whether he simply lost faith in those around him – not unimaginable at United – it became about self before side. And by 2023, his questionable decision-making was no longer limited to between the white lines.",

      "It was a human response. Here was a lad still rooted in his hometown, earning wealth for generations in his mid-20s, carrying more of the burden than many of his team-mates for United’s failings. Many would struggle with such expectation in that environment. Especially when factions of the right-wing press were still going after him for the heinous act of feeding children at a time of national crisis.",
      "Rashford’s activism and advocacy, prompting more changes in government policy than any recent opposition party, should not be forgotten by a soul, least not anyone at United. They were more than happy to bathe in Rashford’s reflective glory. That pride should never fade.",
      "Those things considered – plus more than one debilitating injury through which he played, and upheaval in his personal life – few among us are entitled to judge Rashford harshly for allowing his halo to slip. Perhaps we should give him more credit for the fact it didn’t happen sooner.",
      "But since the back end of 2023, after signing his contract that summer, Rashford simply hasn’t seemed interested in rediscovering the form that earned that mega-deal. Even a pretence was too much. By the time Erik ten Hag was sacked, Rashford seemed to care not one jot how he was perceived by Ruben Amorim or anyone else at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim struggled to contain his befuddlement at the wider mess he inherited at United, but he saw no reason to sugar-coat the reality when it came to Rashford. “You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "That is damning. How bad must things have got with Rashford, since his partner in pre-derby crime, Alejandro Garnacho, continued to be used until Amorim could tolerate him no more?",
      "Amorim’s keeper coach craic came towards the end of a run of a dozen games Rashford sat out amid a transfer request of sorts. Not a real transfer request, of course. Why go to the bother of writing a letter that will cost millions in needlessly-sacrificed salary when you can just use Henry Winter’s X account to tell the world you are ‘ready for a new challenge’ and still get paid?",
      "The misguided belief among Rashford and his people seemed to be that he would have his pick of clubs in January. Barca were mentioned then; in terms of profile, AC Milan sounded a good match too. So perhaps it was slightly more humbling to find himself parked at Aston Villa rather than flying into a European giant.",
      "Even there, Rashford was on the bench more than Unai Emery’s starting XI in the Premier League, and when given the choice to sign the temporary No.9 on a permanent basis, the Villans thought better of it.",
      "All of which makes us wonder if this move to the actual FC Barcelona is a karmic consequence of all the child-feeding and Tory-bothering. Because, as Teddy Sheringham said, this is a grand opportunity that Rashford’s performances and mindset have not merited.",
      "Maybe he should be careful what he wished for. Rashford’s ‘dream’ of signing for Barca could turn sour very quickly if the financially-illiterate club is unable to register him with La Liga. Until they juggle their finances to creep back under the league’s salary limit, it remains a very real possibility.",
      "No-one back in his hometown wants Rashford thrust into that nightmare scenario, even if the stench of burnt bridges fills the Manchester air.",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are turning to Benjamin Sesko this summer as a ‘cabal of superstars’ are set to follow Marcus Rashford out of Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford was reportedly told what he must to do succeed at Barcelona in a meeting with Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd’s Marcus Rashford faces a nervy wait to finalise his loan move to Barcelona amid a summer of issues for the Catalan club.",
      "Marcus Rashford was ‘almost scuppered’ in his mission to join Barcelona from Manchester United because of a slight delay from back-up airport of choice."

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",

The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",

Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",

      "But Barcelona’s willingness to go for their third option Rashford was only given the green light following a meeting between the player and manager Hansi Flick.",
      "Barcelona-based newspaper Sport claim Flick met with the castoff winger last Thursday and explained what his role in the team would be.",
      "‘The German manager was very clear and explained his role in the team. He had to earn a starting spot and, most importantly, he had to sacrifice himself for the team by significantly improving his defensive approach.’",
      "Barcelona’s concerns are backed up by stats. On average per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, Rashford made just 0.59 tackles and won only a third of the tackles he attempted.",
      "He made 4.12 duels, winning just 31.5% and recovered the ball 1.18 times.",
      "In comparison, Lamine Yamal made 0.88 tackles per La Liga game, winning 66.7%, and he also won 8.3 duels at a success rate of 53.4%.",
      "Another hurdle in the player’s way is Barcelona’s potential inability to register him for the upcoming season.",
      "The club has had a number of registration issues in the past, most recently with Dani Olmo and Pau Víctor, with La Liga financial rules much stricter than the Premier League equivalent.",
      "The Athletic say that Barcelona’s unwillingness to allow Williams to leave if he could not be registered was why the player ultimately chose to stay at Athletic and sign a 10-year contract extension.",
      "Currently, Barcelona are over their salary limit with the club and league arguing about how much was made in revenue which means that, as things stand, new players cannot be registered.",
      "Barcelona have already made additions to their squad this summer, notably goalkeeper Joan Garcia arriving from city rivals Espanyol, so the club therefore have to shift some players off their books to allow them to register Rashford.",

      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",

      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Wednesday 23 July 2025 18:09, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",

      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."

      "Already linked with Manchester United and West Ham, Parma's Zion Suzuki is one of the great young goalkeeping talents. Adam Bate speaks to those who have worked with the Japan international to find out why clubs are so excited about his potential...",
      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 10:19, UK",
      "It seems inevitable that Zion Suzuki will move to the Premier League one day. Already courted by Manchester United and West Ham, it is just a matter of when. The hype is justified. This 22-year-old Japan international is seen as a new breed of goalkeeper.",
      "It is by design. Japan have been throwing resources at football with a specific target in mind. Project 2050. The aim is to win a World Cup by then. Frans Hoek, the legendary goalkeeping coach, has been tasked with identifying the traits of the goalkeeper of the future.",
      "In Suzuki, back when he was sat among the substitutes for Urawa Red Diamonds, Hoek spotted all the ingredients required to do it all. \"I saw him in a camp and said, 'This guy has to go to Europe as soon as possible. It does not matter what league it is. He has to play.'\"",
      "And so, Suzuki embarked on the adventure that has taken him to Belgium with Sint-Truiden, onto Italy with Parma and now linked with some of the richest clubs in Europe. Still only 22, the only question is when to make the leap. Those who know him do not doubt his talent.",
      "\"He is a really quiet guy, a really calm character. That is him off the pitch.\" On the pitch, Suzuki becomes something else entirely. He dominates. \"He is really aggressive because he has massive physical strength.\" He is 6'3\" but looks bigger. \"He is so powerful, so dynamic.\"",
      "That physicality clearly underpins his potential. \"It is like his body is just made of muscles. And I have never seen in my life a goalkeeper who can jump higher. His physical tests were off the charts.\" But it is what this physicality enables him to do that is particularly intriguing.",
      "Rudel enjoys telling the story of one of his first sessions with Suzuki. As the goalkeeper coach, he was setting up a drill. \"I said to him, 'Okay, now show me how far you can throw.' I looked away and then saw this ball flying 20 metres over the halfway line,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I turned around and said to him, 'I told you to throw it not kick it.' He just smiled back at me and replied, 'But I did throw it.' I told him to show me again because I could not believe that someone had that much power in their body that they could throw the ball that far.\"",
      "Rudel rates Suzuki as \"above average\" with his feet but as has been seen with Ederson at Manchester City, the tactical significance of being able to pass short and long has increased. Suzuki ranked third for long passes in Serie A last season and second for throws.",
      "In Belgium, Rudel remembers some stunning saves away to Club Brugge, with one stop in particular becoming his trademark. \"It is those low saves because he is so dynamic and so quick to get down. He has unbelievable reflexes. For me, that is his biggest strength.\"",
      "There have been many examples of that for Parma. One down to his left to keep out Tijjani Reijnders' shot for AC Milan in the San Siro stands out, while the save away to Empoli against Ismael Konate was similar. Denying Como's Marc Kempf a headed goal was even better.",
      "The pick of the lot came against Roma in February when he produced an outrageous double save that defied belief. After keeping out Matias Soule's shot, he somehow scrambled to claw away Anass Salah-Eddine's follow-up. It was the save of the season.",
      "\"With those low power saves, his arms are so strong,\" says Rudel in reference to the technique behind it. \"Sometimes when goalkeepers go down fast and get their fingers to the ball, it still goes backwards. That never happens to him. He has crazy power in his hands.\"",
      "What makes Suzuki so fascinating is that he combines these reflex stops with a commanding presence. Think of the great goalkeepers and they tend to favour one or the other. But Suzuki does more than get down low to make saves, he gets high to snuff out the danger.",
      "He caught 55 crosses for Parma last season, 21 more than his nearest rival in Serie A. Across Europe's five major leagues, only Joan Garcia, snapped up by Barcelona this summer, claimed more crosses. Outside the area, Suzuki ranked second in Serie A for sweeping up.",
      "There are still things to work on, as one might expect of a goalkeeper who is still only 22 years old. He also dropped nine catches - a Serie A high - reflecting the fact that this desire to be proactive comes with risk. But he continues to progress, a theme of his short career.",
      "\"That is another of his strengths and why I am convinced that he can perform in the Premier League,\" says Rudel. \"He went from Japan to Belgium and then Belgium to Italy. Those are big adaptations but he did it really quickly. That is what separates the really good ones.\"",
      "Asked if Suzuki will go to the very top, Rudel has no doubts. \"One hundred per cent.\" The only question is how best to manage the journey. Some advise him to wait and play one more season with Parma. But sooner or later, Zion Suzuki will make a very big move.",

      "Report as Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against Leeds; Matheus Cunha made his debut but United failed to show much attacking improvement; Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar, but Leeds had good chances through Largie Ramazani",
      "Saturday 19 July 2025 21:51, UK",
      "Manchester United began their pre-season campaign with a goalless draw against newly-promoted Leeds in Stockholm.",
      "After Ruben Amorim's side recorded their worst-scoring Premier League campaign last term with 44 goals, there were little signs of improvement in front of goal despite starting new £62.5m signing Matheus Cunha, who played the first half.",
      "In fact, Leeds arguably looked the most threatening over the course of the 90 minutes, with Daniel Farke's side having more of the ball in the first half and plenty more chances to take the lead after half-time.",
      "Teenage striker Chido Obi, who started alongside Cunha and Bruno Fernandes in Amorim's attack, had United's best first-half opportunities as he tested Karl Darlow from a tight angle.",
      "The 17-year-old then took the ball off Cunha's toes inside the area - a demonstration of the work still to be done on the training ground to get Amorim's attack on song. Casemiro's deflected cross also crashed off the Leeds crossbar in first-half stoppage time.",
      "Amorim then changed his entire starting XI at half-time but it was Leeds, who also made wholesale changes including giving a debut to Sean Longstaff, who had the better of the second period.",
      "Half-time substitute Joel Piroe set up two big chances for Jaden Bogle and two for Largie Ramazani, but the Whites could only find Tom Heaton's gloves on every occasion. Ao Tanaka also fired wide after a corner was flicked into his path at the far post.",
      "Amorim's United thought they had a penalty when Patrick Dorgu was brought down by Sam Chambers but the referee waved it on, with the wing-back then forcing Illan Meslier into a decent save.",
      "Man Utd then had the best chance of the afternoon as the clock ticked into 90 as Kobbie Mainoo hit the bar from a corner from just two yards out, with Ayden Heaven finding Meslier on the rebound from a similar distance.",
      "Their problems were summarised with their last big chance of the game as Rasmus Hojlund got in the way of Dorgu's goal-bound effort.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on his way to complete a £71m move to Manchester, but there is still a lot left to be desired about Amorim's attack on the basis of this showing.",

      "\"We have a lack of pace. Especially in the middle of the park, you can feel it's hard to bring the ball. But we created chances. We have a lot to do, but it was a first test against a Premier League team with two different teams. A good test.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed what we need, a player in between the lines who is really aggressive. We watched that during last season for a different team [Wolves]. We expect the same thing.",
      "\"You can see the connection with him and Bruno Fernandes is still not there. But it will be a good connection, because you can put a player like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount there. We need to increase our quality in the final third.\"",

That is the beginning of everything. Then we have to put the quality. This club is not just about the effort, it's about the quality. We have to win games.",

      "Yes, it's the first game of pre-season which can lead to freak results anywhere. But no goals from 19 shots, players missing from a few yards out and even team-mates getting in the way of each other. A lot of work is needed on Amorim's training ground.",
      "A lot of eyes were on Cunha's first run-out but his 45 minutes featured very few sparks. The £62.5m signing from Wolves failed to get a shot away and to touch the ball in the opposition box.",

      "There were a few positives for Amorim as Leon looks a promising player at wing-back - though he was caught ball-watching at times as Leeds and Bogle rampaged down his flank.",
      "Goalkeeper Heaton was one of the few United players who came out of that game with a bit of credit, making three or four sharp saves to put his name in the hat for the United No 1 spot, with Andre Onana currently out injured. Talk about scraping the barrel though…",
