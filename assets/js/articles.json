      "Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt is reported to be under investigation on suspicion of being involved in an alleged hit-and-run around the German side's premises on Wednesday morning",
      "Manchester United target Matthijs de Ligt is being investigated 'on suspicion of a hit-and-run' near Bayer Munich's training ground.",
      "BILD claims the 24-year-old collided with a parked car close to the club's Sabener Strasse premises on Wednesday morning, where a witness recognised the Dutchman and contacted police. De Ligt was said to be driving his Audi Q8 e-tron, worth in the region of £63,000.",
      "The German outlet claims that De Ligt's car was towed and impounded after the 24-year-old had, allegedly, 'simply drove away'. A fine or prison sentence could yet await the Netherlands international, if he is found guilty.",
      "\"If convicted, you face up to three years in prison or a fine. Fines are often imposed when people are convicted of such crimes,\" lawyer Marc Wederhake told BILD.",
      "Katharina Thueuerkaufer, a specialist lawyer for criminal and traffic law suggested it would need to be proven that De Ligt was aware he was involved in the collision before driving away. Intention is required to be found guilty of a hit-and-run.",
      "She told BILD: \"A hit-and-run can only be committed intentionally. Now it must be proven that he perceived the accident acoustically, visually or tangibly.\"",
      "De Ligt was left out of Bayern's squad that travelled to South Korea earlier this summer. The former Ajax and Juventus defender has been widely expected to leave the Allianz Arena with Manchester United appearing to the most prominent suitor.",
      "Erik ten Hagconfirmed United's interestlast month. T he 54-year-old told Dutch newspaperAlgemeen Dadblad : ''We still have to wait and see whether De Ligt will come. But the good thing is, during my vacation I was out of the process for three or four weeks.",
      "\"During that period it was really the club, the newly established scouting and recruitment department, that brought in these players. The fact that there are also Dutch players among them is actually a coincidence.",
      "\"Primarily these were players who were brought in by our organisation. But of course I support them, let that be clear – and we still make the choice together.\"",
      "Bayern chief Max Eberl has been coy over De Ligt's possible departure. \"I will comment on the reasons when the time comes,\" he told Sky Sports Germany.",
      "\"It is not yet that time. Matthijs played very well here for two years and that is why many fans like him. Nevertheless, you have to think about how you decide and also how the boy feels. He is still a player for FC Bayern. And as long as he is, he will get all the support from us.\"",

      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Brentford's Ivan Toney have been given a boost with Tottenham closing in on a club-record deal for Bournemouth ace Dominic Solanke",
      "Manchester United have been given a free run at Ivan Toney amid news Tottenham are on the verge of signing Dominic Solanke.",
      "With Rasmus Hojlund sidelined for six weeks, the Red Devils are considering bringing in another striker and are eying up a move for Toney. The Brentford star, 28, could be up for grabs for as little as £40million as his contract with the Bees expires next summer.",
      "Previously, Toney had been linked with Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham, but with Arsenal pursuing other options, Chelsea on the brink of signing Atletico Madrid's Samu Omorodion, and Spurs keen on Solanke, United's hopes of landing the England international have been given a major boost.",
      "According to The Athletic, Solanke has agreed personal terms with Tottenham, who are close to finalising a potential club-record deal for the 26-year-old. The ex-Chelsea and Liverpool forward has a £65m release clause in his Bournemouth contract and it's believed Spurs are willing to offer a sum near that figure.",
      "The north London side have yet to find a replacement for Harry Kane a year after his £100m transfer to Bayern Munich. However, based on recent comments by Ange Postecoglou, the delay appears to be due to Tottenham simply waiting for the right candidate.",
      "\"What's important is the type of striker we get. You know we play a certain way,\" the Spurs boss said during their pre-season tour of Japan. \"We demand certain things from a physical perspective from the technical aspects of it that it's going be a striker that fits that mould.",
      "\"It's still the area of the park we're really probably the thinnest when I talk about squad-wise at the moment, so obviously that's a focus for us.\"",
      "United, meanwhile, aren't in dire need of a new centre forward, especially after shelling out £36m on Joshua Zirkzee last month. However, with Hojlund sidelined for a couple of months, Erik ten Hag only has one fit striker at his disposal and the club might deem a £40m offer for Toney too good to refuse.",
      "Ten Hag usually prefers to field a team with a single centre forward, which suggests that Hojlund, Zirkzee and Toney would all be vying for the same role. But considering Hojlund's patchy performances last season, there's no reason why either Toney or Zirkzee couldn't snatch that spot from him.",
      "Last season, Toney scored just four goals in 17 games for Brentford, though his season was hampered by an eight-month betting ban, which ran from May 2023 until January 2024. He played a bit-part role for England at Euro 2024, though came off the bench to set up Kane's winner in the last-16 against Slovakia, and also scored a penalty in the quarter-final shootout victory over Switzerland.",

      "Manchester United winger Antony has struggled since moving to Old Trafford from Ajax in an £86million transfer two summers ago but he insists he is ready to repay Erik ten Hag's faith this season",
      "Antony has vowed to finally show why Manchester United paid £85million for him – after failing to deliver last season.",
      "The Brazil winger managed just three goals from 38 appearances in a season to forget for the 24-year-old, who faced widespread criticism for his woeful form. Antony faced allegations of physical assault from a former girlfriend at the start of last season and voluntarily attended an interview with Greater Manchester Police.",
      "He was dropped from the Brazil squad because of the allegations and given a month-long personal leave of absence by United to deal with the situation. Even when he returned for United in October, he failed to get anywhere close to justifying his inflated fee and continued to fall way short of expectations.",
      "But after a summer off – he was omitted from Brazil's Copa America squad – and a full pre-season, Antony is determined to show United fans his very best. “I'm someone who demands a lot of myself,” said Antony.",
      "“I was not satisfied with my season, but a lot happened over the year in my personal life. Like it or not, everything I went through had an effect on the pitch. As I've said before, that's behind me now and now it's a new season.",
      "“I've got a strong mentality and I'm focused on what I want and I know that this season will be totally different. Everything I went through was very difficult for me and all my family. I've learnt from it all, I've grown and matured.",
      "“I believe I learnt a lot from the adversity. I learn from everything I go through and learn that everything is possible when you persist in achieving what you want.",
      "“I matured and grew from it all and this will make me stronger going into this new season. New season, new mindset. I feel a lot less burdened and more prepared.”",
      "Antony, who played under United boss Erik ten Hag at Ajax, revealed he keeps a written journal of his objectives and what he must improve on as a player. “I have a lot of objectives, ones I write down for myself,” said Antony. “I definitely need more goal participations and to score more.",
      "“Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists. I always set out objectives. I put them down on paper, rather than on my phone. It allows me to visualise things and to then step onto the pitch with this in mind.”",
      "Antony said he also draws on his tough upbringing, in a Sao Paulo favela, for inspiration whenever he faces adversity, like last season. “I talked about the difficult times I went through last year, but I've overcome more significant difficulties in the favela,” said Antony.",
      "United have unveiled their new adidas home kit with new front-of-shirt sponsors for the 2024/25 season - and you can get your hands on it right now.",
      "“Like when I didn't have boots to play football, when at times there wasn't enough to eat. I saw a lot of friends go down another path and some of them lost their lives. But I always believed in my dream to be where I am today.",
      "“I didn't have a bedroom - I slept on the sofa in the living room. My house would flood when it rained heavily. People don't see these things. I don't use it as an excuse for my performances, as I demand a lot of myself to be always playing well, but these are things people don't see, what we went through and what we suffered.\"",

      "Last month, the Irons agreed a loan-to-buy deal with Nice for the 24-year-old Frenchman worth just shy of £28m but the former Manchester United target snubbed the move as he intended to hold out for the Italian giants.",
      "However, despite weeks of discussions and negotiations, Juve have been able to match Nice's demands and the player has lost patience - allowing West Ham to pounce.",
      "Julen Lopetegui's side are now set to land Todibo on an initial loan with a buy-option worth in the region of £34m (€40m). Nice have also successfully negotiated a sell-on clause that will entitle them to future profit.",
      "West Ham thought they had lost out on Todibo altogether when he made it abundantly clear he wanted to play Champions League football.",
      "But he has remained a top target for Lopetegui, Steidten, David Sullivan and sporting director Mark Noble all summer and they have continued to work on convincing the player to join the club in the background as his preferred move to Juventus stalled.",
      "Steidten flew to France to close the deal on Thursday and Todibo is understood to have joined him on his return flight to London to undergo a medical check after an agreement was reached on personal terms.",
      "West Ham have pulled no punches in the transfer market this summer having already landed Wolves captain Max Kilman, exciting 18-year-old Brazilian attacker Luis Guilherme from Palmeiras, free agent goalkeeper Wes Foderingham, Leeds United star Crysencio Summerville, Borussia Dortmund frontman Niclas Fullkrug and World Cup winner Guido Rodriguez.",

      "Paul Scholes has appealed for Manchester United to make a move for Brentford ’s Ivan Toney despite having already signed Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The Red Devils have been busy in the transfer market when it comes to strikers over recent seasons. Rasmus Hojlund was signed from Atalanta 12 months ago for £72m and he enjoyed a promising debut campaign.",
      "United have bolstered their frontline even further this summer with the signing of Bologna’s Joshua Zirkzee. But Scholes still does not believe that is enough for the coming campaign and has urged the Red Devils hierarchy to move for Brentford frontman Toney.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, he said: \"You have got to look at the forward players. Could Hojlund score 25 goals for us this season? I would be amazed, I’d be surprised.",
      "\"You look at someone like Ivan Toney if he could come to us. Could he score 25 goals? I think he could.",
      "\"I think he [Hojlund] is really good but he has been brought into this country at 19 [21] years of age and he has been asked to be the No.9 for Man United. It is an iconic role for players who are scoring 20, 25, 30 goals and winning league titles.",
      "\"He should be a second, third or fourth-choice striker at a big club. They have brought in [Joshua] Zirkzee and I will be honest, I have never seen him play. I think goals will be a problem. I look at Zirkzee and I don’t think he has been a great goalscorer wherever he has been.",
      "\"He has got almost 40 goals in something like 150 games [48 goals in 143 appearances] which, coming to the Premier League, is only going to get more difficult.\"",
      "Toney could potentially be on the move sooner rather than later. He has just one year remaining on his contract with Brentford.",
      "And it appears that the Red Devils are in the running for his services should he choose to move on. Reports this week have suggested that they still hold an interest in him despite having already signed Zirkzee.",
      "Should Toney arrive at Old Trafford over the coming weeks, it would certainly alleviate a troublesome headache for Erik ten Hag heading into the new season. Hojlund is ruled out for the next few weeks having picked up an injury in pre-season. Ten Hag has also suggested that Zirkzee still needs time to adapt so is unlikely to start in the Red Devils’ Premier League opener against Fulham.",

      "The centre-half was someway down the pecking order and had been linked with a switch to a Championship outfit. United had made it clear, following the major setback to Leny Yoro, which rules him out for months, that Fish would only be allowed to seek pastures new if they landed a new defender.",

      "United manager Erik ten Hag walked onto the pitch to check on Fish’s well-being immediately after he suffered his injury blow at the weekend and it is understood he had a scan on his return to Carrington on Monday. Sources say Fish did not suffer a fracture and the prognosis is better than the player had expected.",
      "The trip across the Atlantic proved to be a nightmare in terms of the squad's fitness. Five of the club's senior centre backs suffered either an injury or illness during their tour. Harry Maguire was left out of the Liverpool game as a precaution, Victor Lindelof was taken off at half-time for the same reason and Jonny Evans came off at the same time as he was unwell.",

      "Manchester United have already spent £36million to sign Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna in order to improve their attack but Erik ten Hag still isn't satisfied with his options",
      "Manchester United haven't given up hope of signing £40million-rated Ivan Toney - and he could drastically change their attack.",
      "Toney, 28, has entered the final year of his contract at current club Brentford, who'd be willing to do business at around £40million. The England international has frequently been linked with a move to Old Trafford, although United's decision to spend £36m on Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee in July looked to have signalled the end of their pursuit.",
      "But it soon emerged that the Red Devils wanted to sign another striker in the summer transfer window, a desire which has grown since Rasmus Hojlund was recently ruled out for the first few weeks of the season, leaving Zirkzee as the only senior option up front. Due to representing the Netherlands at Euro 2024, however, the Dutchman didn't feature in any of United's pre-season friendlies and is unlikely to start in Saturday's Community Shield game against bitter rivals Manchester City.",
      "That limits Erik ten Hag's options for now but if United can get Toney over the line, there's a variety of ways which they could set up for the 2024-25 Premier League season. Mirror Football looks at what Ten Hag's dream front three could be - and some more.",
      "Jadon Sancho has had such a stop-start career at Old Trafford that the £73million winger could well feel like a new signing this season. Having buried the hatchet with Ten Hag after helping Borussia Dortmund reach the Champions League final while on loan there, he's hungry to make himself a regular for United three years after first arriving.",
      "His style of play would compliment Marcus Rashford's more direct approach on the left wing, with the Red Devils hero desperate to silence his critics after also missing out on Euro 2024 like Sancho. Neither have played alongside Toney before but the Brentford talisman's physical presence down the middle would allow Rashford and Sancho to run in behind and profit from flick-ons and Toney's acclaimed hold-up play.",
      "Your turn! Who should be in Manchester United's front three? Give us your picks in the comments section",
      "Nothing gets Old Trafford off their feet like a winger rapidly marauding down the flanks, so why not two? Alejandro Garnacho was among Ten Hag's most used players last season and it's hard to believe that he's still only 20. He's certainly deserving of a starting spot and could even challenge Rashford on the left flank if Sancho - or one of Amad or Antony - gets the nod on the right.",
      "The common setup during their dismal 2023-24 campaign, scoring goals certainly wasn't United's biggest issue last season when these three were on the pitch together. The problem for Ten Hag was injuries and that's what prompted him to look for two new strikers who can take the burden off Hojlund.",
      "At 21, the Dane could learn from being team-mates with the more experienced Toney, who also showed for England that he's capable of making an impact as a substitute.",
      "For the vast majority of Ten Hag's reign, he's stuck with a 4-2-3-1 formation and had two wingers flanking one striker. But at times last season, the ex-Ajax boss used a 4-4-2 diamond both in and out possession, with Bruno Fernandes sometimes finding himself as the No.9 and Scott McTominay sitting slightly deeper, such as in May's FA Cup final victory.",
      "So, given that Zirkzee recently admitted that he's a 'nine-and-a-half', how about playing him alongside Toney (or Hojlund) with Fernandes pulling the strings in behind? Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo both have the all-round attributes to operate as shuttling midfielders, and McTominay previously played as one under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "The formation would also offer Casemiro more protection in the No.6 role ahead of what's set to be a make-or-break season for many at Old Trafford.",

      "Premier League champions often go into a new season with the most expectation but Michael Owen believes Manchester City will drop down to fourth under Pep Guardiola",
      "Manchester City are seeking an unprecedented fifth successive Premier League title this season.",
      "Pep Guardiola and co just made history by winning four on the bounce, but Michael Owen doesn't think they'll even be in the hunt, let alone retain their crown this term. In fact the former Liverpool man reckons the champions will finish fourth - quite the fall from grace.",
      "He's cited the distractions around the 115 charges levied against them, although that hasn't been an issue for them as of yet. Owen though boldly suggested: \"If City are not gonna be really in the race after 10 games then their priority could go elsewhere - I think there could be a big surprise this season.",
      "\"They’ve also got the investigation hanging over them and Pep Guardiola is not going to be there forever. This could be his last season.\"",
      "Guardiola's relentless standards have allowed the Manchester outfit to stay top of the pile. Since winning the title in 2018 they've not finished lower than second.",
      "That hasn't always been the case for champion sides though. After scaling the mountain some have dropped off more than others. It is easy to tip the holders for another impressive year, but for a variety of reasons some teams fall off a cliff.",
      "In light of Owen's comments, which if true would be quite the prediction, we take a look at Premier League champions who faced a drop off the year after they lifted the trophy.",
      "Those at Ewood Park cherished their moment in the sun, but it didn't last long. Alan Shearer landed his only title win at Anfield on a dramatic final day. But Manchester United, the team who had finished second, soon wrestled back their crown as Blackburn slumped to a seventh place finish.",
      "Their success was built on the fortunes of Jack Walker, their owner who had thrown huge sums at the playing group. They eventually finished seventh the following year - and were as low as 15th after eight games of the campaign. They had managed to retain the majority of their winning outfit, but after a failed title defence they all begun seeking pastures new.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was out and David Moyes was in. An opening day victory at Swansea was as good as the feeling got as it quickly became apparent this United side had perhaps overachieved by winning the title, owing a lot to the goals of Robin van Persie.",
      "Moyes was hailed as the Chosen One, but he failed to last the season before he was given the sack. United were embarrassed at Old Trafford by Liverpool and City, who both secured 3-0 wins. Come early December they were ninth having won just five of their first 15 matches. In truth, the Red Devils have never truly found their feet since the Scot's exit and their demise that year was a sign of the struggles that were to come.",
      "Whilst some drop offs you can see coming, this one was a bolt of lightning no one forecasted. Jose Mourinho seemed to be at the peak of his powers and had breezed to another title triumph, but an opening day draw with Swansea, marred by a clash with the club's physio, set about a series of events that led to Mourinho's demise.",
      "At the halfway stage of the season the Blues were in a genuine relegation scrap. Mourinho had claimed the club would have to sack their most successful ever manager before he said his work was \"betrayed\" after losing to Leicester - shortly before he was given the chop.",
      "Gus Hiddink led them to the end of the season as they replaced Blackburn by posting, statistically, the worst ever season as defending champions by ending up in tenth.",
      "Plenty will argue their tag of Premier League champions - whilst remarkable and an incredible narrative - wasn't exactly a fair gauge of the club and its players. They also lost N'Golo Kante, arguably their best player, after winning the title so were certainly hampered.",
      "A loss to newly promoted Hull on the opening day was a sign of things to come as Claudio Ranieri went from hero to zero, receiving his marching orders in February after five successive losses left them in 17th. Craig Shakespeare helped lead a resurgence that eventually led them to mid-table after the threat of relegation appeared very real.",
      "Another Blues blow up under an outspoken coach, this time Antonio Conte. The Italian had broken numerous records in his debut season en route to the title. However swiftly things turned sour as there was talk of Conte walking away before a ball was kicked ahead of his second season.",
      "A 3-2 home loss to Burnley, who had led 3-0, on the opening day set a sour tone. Chelsea secured some notable wins but there was an undertone of an angered Conte, who publicly challenged the club to match his ambition after missing out on transfer targets. A home hammering at the hands of Bournemouth was among the lowest points.",
      "FA Cup success at Wembley salvaged some silverware but eventually the Blues finished in fifth meaning they missed out on the Champions League for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era.",

      "Gordon Strachan doesn't think Erik ten Hag regards Ruud van Nistelrooy as a threat to his future at Manchester United.",
      "Ten Hag, 54, put pen to paper on a contract extension this year despite leading United to an underwhelming eighth-place finish in the Premier League last term. He brought the Van Nistelrooy on board after winning the FA Cup against Manchester City as part of major changes to his backroom staff, which saw Steve McLaren and Mitchell van der Gaag leave Old Trafford.",
      "There had been rumours the club were on the look to replace Ten Hag, but they ultimately decided to stick with the under-fire boss, who welcomed former Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake alongside Van Nistelrooy onto his new-look staff, reports the Manchester Evening News.",
      "However, speaking to topoffshorecasinos.com, Strachan dismissed any speculation that Van Nistelrooy could step into Ten Hag's role in the near future.",
      "\"No, I don't think that Erik ten Hag will be looking at Ruud van Nistelrooy and thinking to himself that man wants my job,\" the Scotsman said. \"You can't be looking over your shoulder as a manager, that's the last thing you would do. I think it would be far too obvious if the club are thinking about replacing Ten Hag with Ruud van Nistelrooy. It would be too transparent.\"",
      "He shared his own experience, saying: \"As a manager, it's just another part of the job that he has to deal with. I've managed clubs where certain players have really close relationships with the hierarchy of executives, and you just have to get on with it.\"",
      "However, Strachan also expressed scepticism about the potential appointment: \"I just can't see the people who are calling the shots appointing van Nistelrooy if things turn sour. It's like having a burglar sitting in the dugout wearing a balaclava and a hooped shirt carrying a swag bag.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy's first competitive game in the United dugout will come on Saturday. The Red Devils face Manchester City in the Community Shield – the traditional curtain raiser to the season – in a repeat of the FA Cup final from just a few months ago.",

      "The Red Devils have been busy in the summer transfer busy so far having signed both Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee for significant fees. However, there is another exciting bit of business in the works.",
      "Man United have been linked with a move for Arsenal’s youngster Chido Obi-Martin. The 16-year-old striker had become one of the most exciting starlets to come out of the Gunners’ academy over recent years having plundered 32 goals among the under-18s last term. Even better, he was available at the end of his Arsenal contract.",
      "While it appears that a deal should be straightforward given he is a free agent, there has been a significant delay in getting the youngster through the door. According to The Athletic, the delay is down to Man United being locked into negotiations with Arsenal.",
      "While Obi-Martin is a free agent, the Red Devils still have to pay a compensation fee due to his age. It is suggested that talks are anticipated to end in an agreement without the need for negotiations to go to a tribunal.",
      "The deal will then go through a formal Premier League ratification process, which could take a few weeks. Once the move is approved, it is expected that Obi-Martin will go into Man United’s under-18 side, with the potential to move into the under-21 group.",
      "Depending on how he performs, he could then potentially be given the opportunity to train with the club’s first-team. Man United were not the only side linked with him, with Bayern Munich also interested but the Red Devils look likely to win the race for his signature.",
      "The move would be a significant coup for Ten Hag given how highly rated Obi-Martin is. Speaking about his talents, ex-Arsenal star and now academy coach Jack Wilshere said: \"He's been exceptional.",
      "“I've said it before but credit to everyone at the club and at Hale End for the work that they have done with him. He's adapted so well, helped the team massively at times. Also, credit to his teammates too because they serve him so well, and he's grateful for that.\"",
      "Away from Obi-Martin, Man United chiefs are still working on adding a new midfielder to the squad. Sander Berge of Burnley has emerged as an option over recent days.",

      "The Red Devils have had a new holding midfielder on their wishlist all summer long, with several options linked in recent weeks. PSG's Manuel Ugarte emerged as a primary target, but negotiations have stalled over the £51million-rated Uruguayan.",
      "With that move hanging in balance, the net has been cast wider as Ten Hag, gearing up for his third campaign in charge at Old Trafford, eyes other options. And there's a common theme amongst them.",
      "Palmeiras' Richard Rios, Atalanta's Ederson and Burnley's Sander Berge have each previously been praised for not only their talents but also their exemplary attitudes.",
      "Colombian international Rios had his praises sung by Palmeiras boss Abel Ferreira after a 3-0 win over Fortaleza last season.",
      "\"He's a good player who helps us,\" lauded Ferreira. \"When I look at a player it isn't just about his technique, it's about tactics, physicality, mentality and character. He has a good character.\"",
      "Ederson, meanwhile, has also caught Liverpool's eye after a standout season in Serie A, culminating in Europa League glory. His ex-Corinthians manager Tiago Nunes was full of compliments for his technical prowess and rock-solid mindset, Nunes said: \"My first impressions were of a player with a lot of strength, a lot of physical ability, a player who was a powerful striker on the ball, with good technique. Basically, someone with characteristics that are difficult to find, especially in Brazilian football.",
      "\"He has two main strengths. Firstly, on the pitch, he has great physical strength, with the ability to play box-to-box, back and forth, sustaining the pace of the game. Secondly, he has a very strong mentality, with a very clear awareness of what he wants.",
      "\"I see him playing as a box-to-box player, a midfielder who isn't really someone to build the game but more of a player who can break through lines, get into the final third, progress up the field. I see him more as a midfielder with the freedom to get forward.\"",
      "In similar fashion, Burnley's Berge received accolades for his on-field attitude from former Sheffield United boss Paul Heckingbottom, who hailed: \"Football-wise, he's been great all the time.",
      "\"We told him there was goals in this game for him, and he got half a yard and got a shot off. He's been performing like that all the time, scoring goals since day one, and I can't speak highly enough of him.",
      "\"We love him here. Not just as a footballer; he's a fantastic person and you can see what we think of him. His performances on the pitch are great but how he carries himself is even better and we're delighted to still have him.\"",
      "Regardless of who Ten Hag ends up having at his disposal for the new season, it seems certain they'll bring a high level of professionalism to the dressing room - something that appears to have been sorely missing in recent years at the club.",

      "Manchester United's Dan Gore has still not returned to training after suffering a freak shoulder injury.",
      "The young midfielder was hoping to further stake his case under Erik ten Hag having been one of several youth prospects who were included in last summer's pre-season tour. He missed out this year though after dislocating his shoulder during a personal training session",
      "Gore required surgery at the beginning of June and is yet to return to training at Carrington as he continues his recovery from the freak injury with his pre-season being disrupted as a result. A loan move was touted as an option but his lack of fitness may cost him.",
      "The window will soon close and a switch in January now looks more likely, reports the MEN. United need to decide on how they will handle the player's long-term development after Gore spent the last six months of last season on loan with Port Vale, before disaster struck after just one appearance when he sustained his injury.",
      "The teenager has more than proved he's willing to put himself about and mix it with established stars in order to further his own career. Back in Ten Hag's first season he was involved in a brief training ground bust up with Anthony Martial after Frenchman took issue with his aggressiveness.",
      "They were forced to temporarily halt a training session for non-World Cup players at Carrington which also featured a number of youth-team stars were also drafted in. Gore clattered Martial with a robust tackle, which sparked an angry confrontation between the pair.",
      "Martial is alleged to have lashed out and caught the teenager, who is said to have stood his ground against the former first-team star. They had to be pulled apart, with Gore told by Ten Hag and his staff that tackling first-team stars was off-limits in training games.",
      "Ten Hag handed Gore his debut on his 19th birthday as he came off the bench during a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace. The United was keen to shut down suggestions the debut was in any way a ‘gift’ for the teenager - insisting he deserved his shot.",
      "He said: “It’s a good birthday for him, but I’m not a coach who gives opportunities to players [for no reason], they have to earn it. Once they earn it, they have their chance. They have to earn it every day in training. I don’t hand opportunities to young players. They must consistently prove their worth in training because if they don’t, it can affect the team.\"",

      "Manchester United are considering a move for Ivan Toney as his Brentford contract winds down and the Bees consider offloading him for a reasonable fee that could interest the Red Devils",
      "Manchester United have not totally given up on landing Ivan Toney as they weigh up their options.",
      "The Red Devils are among those to be linked with the Brentford frontman, who only has 12 months left on his deal in west London. The Bees want to maximise their profits and have previously quoted a hefty fee - which did put off potential suitors.",
      "But with time no longer on their side Brentford may have to drop their price and United themselves are considering reinforcements in that area following the injury to Rasmus Hojlund, who could be out for two months. Erik ten Hag also wants to ensure he has some experience in the final third with Toney having proven himself as a Premier League marksman.",
      "The forward has been able to make the step up from the Championship with his exploits in the top flight earning him England recognition. In both his full Premier League campaigns he's hit double figures.",
      "Forbes claim that Brentford would now be willing to do business for around £40million - a price that may tempt those at Old Trafford as they look to ensure they are well resourced in their forward line ahead of the new season.",
      "“We are always looking,” Ten Hag has said about the club making new signings. “This new leadership team is really eager to do business. To make deals. They are on it. But we have to wait if the timing is there, if the opportunities are there. I can’t say in this moment but I am sure when they are there, we will go forward.”",
      "Last term a huge burden was placed on Hojlund despite his lack of experience. The Dane was signed with a long-term view in mind but was immediately asked to lead the line on his own, failing to score a league goal until Boxing Day.",
      "His injury leaves Ten Hag light, albeit he has signed Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee. The former Bologna man is not and out and out forward but is not yet up to match sharpness as United consider playing in this weekend's Community Shield with either Jadon Sancho or Bruno Fernandes as a striker.",
      "Ten Hag said: \"That is what we can do if we don’t have the availability of Rasmus. Of course, Joshua Zirkzee is coming in. He has started training. But he is not so long in training so it it will take time and he has to adjust to English football and our way of playing. Jadon can, of course, play as a striker. He can also play in wide areas but it could be that he is a good option.\"",

      "The Red Devils have already landed two signings in the form of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro, but an injury blow to the latter could force the club back into the market. Recruits are being considered in all areas as INEOS look to make an impact in their first full season.",

      "The Red Devils plan to keep Old Trafford and downsize it if they opt to build a new stadium on land next door. The Old Trafford redevelopment project are looking to reduce their current home as they plot to build a new £2billion, 100,000-capacity, state-of-the-art stadium.",
      "There is a desire from those involved at the Manchester to create “the Wembley of the north “ and - should that go ahead - the plan is for Old Trafford, which can currently hold 74,310 fans, to be scaled down to a capacity of around 30,000 to 35,000.",
      "The reduced arena would then be used as a stadium for United’s women’s team as well as the club’s various academy teams. There is a desire from those involved to maintain the history and the heritage that has been created at their long-term home.",
      "Among features to be preserved in a potentially scaled-down Old Trafford would include the Munich clock and the central tunnel on the halfway line, which players used to use in the past.",
      "Ten Hag has not ruled out moving for Sofyan Amrabat before the end of this summer's transfer window, but landing him permanently on this occasion. The Moroccan moved from Fiorentina 12 months ago but only joined on loan following an impressive World Cup.",
      "United have the option to make their loan deal for Ambrabat a permanent one - and that is being considered, reports the Telegraph. There are concerns over the original fee agreed for the player, who was plagued by injury and didn't produce his best form.",
      "The club are desperate to strengthen their midfield ranks ahead of the window closing later this month and they are being linked with a plethora of options as a deal for Ugarte looking increasingly unlikely given PSG's price demands.",
      "Another midfield on the United radar is Sander Berge, who they were linked with way back in 2020 before he eventually moved to Sheffield United. Last summer he made the switch to Burnley but could be on the move once more after their relegation.",
      "The Sun reports that after making contact with Berge’s representatives, the Red Devils were informed that the Clarets wanted £30m for the Norway international. United are only willing to pay £20m for the midfielder, who was signed from Sheffield United for £12m last summer.",
      "The Old Trafford hierarchy have continued to run into issues when targeting players this summer. Several potential sellers have quoted hefty prices and refused to come down. That has also been an issue in United's pursuit of Jarrad Branthwaite with Everton demanding £70m.",

      "Midfield ought to have been the priority for United. A new No.6 to complement Mainoo. But, as Ten Hag noted last week, their positions are \"occupied\". Under profitability and sustainability rules, United cannot stockpile departments where the weekly wage bill is well is around £750,000.",
      "United had the finances and leverage to bring in Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro as high earners Anthony Martial and Raphael Varane came off the payroll on July 1. Hence why fees were agreed for Zirkzee and Yoro within the first two weeks of last month.",
      "It has gone quiet on centre halves Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt as Victor Lindelof, the great survivor, has still not been shifted. Lindelof only played two halves across United's five pre-season friendlies due to an ominous \"niggle\". For Noussair Mazraoui to come, Aaron Wan-Bissaka must go.",

      "The setback all but rules out a transfer for Fish, who has generated interest from Championship clubs. The 21-year-old's contract expires next year but United have the option of an additional year.",
      "Before the injury, Fish was told he would not be sold unless there was another incoming at centre half due to new signing Leny Yoro’s fractured metatarsal that could rule him out until November. United sold centre back Willy Kambwala last month and released Raphael Varane.",
      "Manchester United have failed to remove Sofyan Amrabat from the squad list on their official club website, despite his loan move officially ending 39 days ago.",
      "Amrabat was signed on a season-long loan on deadline day in last summer's transfer window and Fiorentina received a €10million loan fee (around £8.5m) from United.",
      "Although Amrabat is wearing United's home kit for the 2024/25 season on the website, it's understood the photos for the new campaign weren't recently taken by a photographer.",
      "Manuel Ugarte was understood to be United's number one target but tension between valuation of the midfielder has led to reports indicating the club have turned their attention elsewhere.",
      "However, for multiple reasons, Ugarte doesn't tick the boxes that Ten Hag and United need. Opinions are everything in football but the Uruguay international doesn't solve the desperate need for a tackling machine. Yet it's a look at some analytic data that gives Ineos further reason not to match PSG's £51m valuation.",

      "The graph showcased each player's pass completion percentage and progressive passes per 90 (at least 10 metres long and moves the ball at least 25% of the remaining distance to the goal). Ugarte sits in the top three for pass completion at over 90%, which is encouraging, but his progressive passes per 90 is only four.",

Thank you very much, as always, for joining us tonight and The Manchester Evening News will be back with more news, views and transfer rumours first thing on Friday morning. We are one step closer to the weekend and with that another trip to Wembley!",
      "It looks as though former United goalkeeper David De Gea has secured a new club. He left Old Trafford over 12 months ago and inadvertantly took a break from the game. As per our update earlier, the Spaniard is on his way to Fiorentina with one or two formalities to complete;",
      "Sofyan Amrabat is ready to 'give up' on a dream return to United this summer.",
      "That's according to breakthrough reports from HITC on the Fiorentina midfielder.",
      "United still hold an option to buy their 28-year-old former loanee.",
      "However, as they continue to pursue cover and competition for Casemiro in their engine room, United are shopping elsewhere with Fenerbahce mooted as a potential destination for Amrabat instead. A lot has been made about the club's search for a new midfielder in the last 24 hours.",
      "Federico Chiesa is being mooted with a depature from Juventus this summer with Chelsea, Tottenham and (tenatively) Unuted linked with a move for him. According to former United striker Louis Saha - who was speaking to CSDB.gg- the Italy forward would be an ideal addition for Erik ten Hag;",
      "Manchester United should go and sign Federico Chiesa from Juventus. I love him as a player, he is so passionate and will cause plenty of trouble for the opposition whether he is at the top of his game or not. He always tries to upset the opposition and he would be a great target for United, they have creative players but none that can match what he can do.",
      "How much of an impact will this have? You would have thought Bayern have alternative targets in mind - which would allow them to free up Matthijs de Ligt for sale - but the Germany heavyweights have been pushing hard for Jonathan Tah's signature this summer;",
      "An update in the transfer triangle involving United, Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen this summer. A proposed move to United for Matthijs de Ligt will (probably) depend on Bayern signing Jonathan Tah from their Bundesliga rivals. That's not new, as such, but emerging reports from Sky Germany - via Florian Plettenberg on social media - indicate that a deadline set out by Leverkusen is about to pass. Both players seemingly want the move, though.",
      "Speculation over Jadon Sancho and his Old Trafford future remains at fever pitch. However, with ongoing injuries and fitness woes, there is every chance the was-ousted United forward could be needed early-season. Here are the latest betting odds from Bet365 on a proposed move;",

      "Three goals and two assists in a season for a €100million Manchester United forward. Antony is aware of the statistics.",
      "He has started to jot down objectives on paper - goal participations, assists, where he can improve, how many shots he should register, dribble and pass completions. If Antony does not have the hard copy at hand, he will ask his wife, Rosilene Silva, to sift through the files and send him pictures. He looks at them every day.",
      "\"I definitely need more goal participations and to score more goals,\" he says in the lobby of United's Beverly Hills hotel. \"It's something I demand from myself.",
      "\"Rest assured, you'll hear the name Antony in relation to goals and assists.\"",
      "The only time Antony's name was heard last season was at Newport County, the scene of one of his goals. Only the natives provided the orchestra. The lyrics are unrepeatable.",
      "There are ongoing investigations in England and Brazil into allegations of domestic abuse against Antony, which he denies. The 24-year-old took a leave of absence for four weeks last year and voluntarily attended an interview at a police station in September.",
      "Antony returned for United's sixth defeat in ten games against Galatasaray in October. There would be more spirals in a fraught season and Antony was among those at the club overwhelmed by the maelstrom.",
      "Erik ten Hag has managed Antony in all four of his seasons in Europe at United and Ajax and admitted the off-the-pitch matters had affected the Brazilian on the pitch. \"I'm someone who demands a lot of myself,\" Antony stresses. \"I was obviously not satisfied with my season but a lot happened over the year in my personal life. Like it or not, everything I went through had an effect on the pitch.",
      "\"As I've said before, that's behind me now and now it's a new season. I've got a strong mentality and I'm focused on what I want, I know that this season will be totally different.",
      "\"Everything I went through was very difficult for me and all my family. I've learnt from it all, I've grown and matured. I believe I learnt a lot from the adversity. I learn from everything I go through and learn that everything is possible when you persist in achieving what you want.",
      "\"That's why I said I put the past behind me, what I went through last season. There were good moments as well, winning a trophy in a United shirt is really important. I matured and grew from it all and this will make me stronger going into this new season.",
      "\"As I said - new season, new mindset I'm a lot more focussed and prepared to achieve great things. I feel a lot less burdened and more prepared as well. I'm a lot more focused, and as you said, a lot freer to do what I genuinely know how to do. I'm 100 per cent prepared and focused to help United.\"",
      "Inferninho, the name of the favela (working-class neighbourhoods outside of major Brazilian cities) Antony grew up in, is tattooed across his neck. The 24-year-old lived in Inferninho for ten years with his mother, father, brother and sister until his parents separated in 2010. Antony continued to live in Inferninho until 2019.",
      "The family often ran out of food, their home would flood whenever it rained and Antony did not have a bedroom, so he slept on the sofa. Roseline, who gave birth to the couple's daughter Lavinne in June, grew up in the same favela.",
      "\"When people talk about me or criticise me, I always find solace in where I came from,\" Antony says. \"I'll never let anyone else write my story or let people put me down as I genuinely know what it's like to be at the bottom.",
      "\"I'm really grateful to the favela, it's somewhere I suffered a lot, but always with a smile on my face. It is also where I saw my best friend go down another path.",
      "\"For me to represent the favela today is so rewarding, it's somewhere I'll take with me for the rest of my life. I always play with favela written on my boots as it's always with me. I have a lot of relatives that still live there, the majority of my family still live there - my parents and brother and sister don't live there anymore.",
      "\"Whenever I'm on holiday I always look to pay a visit, even if it's for a short amount of time - it renews my energy, reminds me where I come from and everything I went through to get here.",
      "\"As I said before, I always get emotional talking about the favela because it's somewhere I learnt so much through adversity. We had nothing, just our faith in God and determination. I remember when I was little my mum and dad would work a lot and only come home at night.",
      "\"I said to my mum that there will come a time when she can stop working and I'll be the one doing the running and providing. Today I can live this dream, I can see my mum provided for well and I'm doing the running now.",
      "Antony has \"tremendous affection\" for Ten Hag, who references his roots in Inferninho whenever they talk. Yet his privileges under the United manager were revoked last season and Antony was visibly unhappy about being moved to left back during the 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Some teammates previously felt Antony enjoyed preferential treatment but he started in only 21 of their 52 games in 2023-24. Amad lined up ahead of him in all five of United's pre-season friendlies and Antony hobbled off after 23 minutes against Real Betis with an ankle knock. He recovered to come on against Liverpool three days later.",
      "Both of the right wingers got on the scoresheet in that FA Cup quarter-final for the ages against Liverpool in March. Amad cost £50m less than Antony and is the fans' favourite to occupy the right-hand side.",
      "\"I'm happy to be playing with such great players and competing with them, it shows that United work with high-level players,\" Antony says diplomatically. \"Jadon Sancho, another top player is back as well, he's coming from a Champions League final.",
      "\"For me, playing with and competing with these players is really important, it helps me to develop further. It's healthy competition, everyone respects each other. When Amad, (Alejandro) Garnacho or Jadon score we'll all celebrate together as helping United win is what drives us.\"",
      "\"A lot happened last season. I played full back and was a little uneasy about it but that was because with the team losing or drawing you want to be in the attack to turn things around and help the team, so being moved into defence bothered me a bit, you feel annoyed in the moment during the game, but afterwards it's all fine.\"",
      "His 2023-24 season was not devoid of highlights. Antony's performance in the crushing defeat at Chelsea in April was his best for United while the slick 87th-minute equaliser against Liverpool was the season-salvaging turning point.",
      "And with his right foot. \"Yes, yes they will see more - it's there written on paper in my objectives - more work on the right foot, score more goals and assists. I'll show you these notes one day and you'll see the results this season.\"",

      "Manchester United are a week away from the start of their Premier League campaign and question marks still remain about whether or not they have added enough depth to their squad.",
      "Two new acquisitions have been added this summer: defender Leny Yoro and striker Joshua Zirkzee. The former has already picked up a long-term injury while Rasmus Hojlund is also set to miss the first few weeks of the season.",
      "While the transfer deadline is not until the end of the month, Erik ten Hag would have been keen to make the majority of his additions before the Premier League kicks off. This now appears unlikely though as United appear to be no closer to any more new faces.",
      "This has not stopped the rumour mill going into overdrive regarding Brentford striker Ivan Toney. United are believed to be interested in the striker in the wake of Hojlund's injury.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has rounded up all the news surrounding Toney's future and United's reported interest.",
      "At the beginning of the year, it was reported that Brentford could be looking for as much as £100m for Toney to allow him to leave. However, a slow end to last season has seen interest in the forward drop and the Bees lower their asking price accordingly.",
      "According to Forbes, the Reds are planning to revisit their interest due to the injury to Hojlund. If they were to make an approach for the striker, it would cost them £40m.",
      "It is no secret the Englishman would be interested in moving on from Brentford this summer. In the build-up to his return to football following a gambling ban, Toney conducted several interviews declaring his interest in a big transfer.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports in January, the striker said: \"You can never predict when is the right time to move elsewhere, but I think it's obvious I want to play for a top club. Everybody wants to play for a top club, that is fighting for titles.\"",
      "While it is understood interest in Toney has reemerged due to the injury to Hojlund, former United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the striker could score more goals than the Dane if he was playing for the Reds. \"Could Hojlund score 25 goals for us this season? I would be amazed, I’d be surprised,\" Scholes told The Overlap Fan Debate.",
      "\"You look at someone like Ivan Toney if he could come to us. Could he score 25 goals? I think he could.\"",
      "The Athletic reported last weekend that United were looking in-house to solve their lack of depth up front with Jadon Sancho and Bruno Fernandes being considered as potential false nines. There is believed to be a reluctance at Old Trafford to sign another striker without selling someone to fund it.",
      "MEN Sport has previously reported that Zirkzee's arrival effectively paused interest in another striker being added to the ranks at this stage. We understand today that unless Sancho is sold, no further attacking players will be added to the team with defence and midfield the priority.",
      "However, it is not only the costs involved which could put the Reds' minority owners going for Toney. At 28, Toney is considered a player without major resale value and Ineos have gained a reputation at Nice for not bringing players in who are as old as the English striker.",

      "The Londoners summer spending is set to be more than £150m and above Aston Villa as the Premier League club with the biggest transfer outlay so far. As for Wolves, they have reinforced their squad with four signings thus far with Neto following former captain Max Kilman out of the door.",
      "While no manager wants to lose their key players, O'Neil has hinted that Wolves would be willing to do business if replacements can be found. United may still be in with a chance to complete a swoop.",

      "The easiest decision Harry Amass gave Manchester United during their pre-season tour was to keep him with the first team. Now it is to put him in the first team.",
      "Death, taxes and an injured Luke Shaw. The season has not started and Shaw, back at United for less than a week, is already a \"question mark\" for the Community Shield. There are cones on the pitch and on the roads at Carrington amid the £50million refurbishment to the first team base.",
      "There must also be something in the water at the training ground as United defenders are dropping like flies again. Erik ten Hag could be without six defenders against Manchester City. The third-choice centre back as it stands is Rhys Bennett, who played once on loan at Stockport in League Two last season.",
      "There is something particularly galling about Shaw succumbing to another injury. He played 15 times for United last season yet was gradually integrated into the England team during the European Championship, where he played 177 minutes across three knockout matches.",
      "Shaw still took three weeks off, as he is entitled to, despite not playing for United since February 18. You can see it from both sides. Allow a brittle player ample recovery time for the start of the new season or insist he invests in his club as much as his country.",

He has not participated in a single full first team training session as United's touring players were given Monday and Tuesday off. Shaw was not visible in training on Wednesday and described on Thursday as a doubt for the Community Shield.",
      "Even if he trains on Friday, Shaw is not going to start at Wembley. One team training session before a game would be a risk for the durable Bruno Fernandes, never mind the injury-prone Shaw.",
      "No matter. Amass, 17, has been building up to this moment. He started against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool in the United States and improved with each performance. Mohamed Salah got the better of Toby Collyer but not Amass in South Carolina.",
      "So whether it is Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden or someone else he is pitted against, Amass has had the perfect warm-up act. He has also been at Wembley with United on matchday - as a substitute in the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Amass was gutted he was unused on the seven occasions he was named in a matchday squad. Ten Hag was privately adamant he was not ready.",
      "Only last week, Ten Hag suggested Amass required another three months to get up to speed. \"We have to make progress, but we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season.",
      "\"We had it during last season with Kobbie (Mainoo), but he is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.",
      "\"But in this moment, he (Amass) needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Amass caught up with Salah more than once on Saturday. In the mixed zone in San Diego last week, Amass was in between Toby Collyer and Ethan Wheatley. Literally the centre of attention.",
      "He had tallied an assist for Amad in the win against Betis and, with Tyrell Malacia still months away from a return and Shaw away on holiday, the conversation turned to a possible breakthrough for Amass.",
      "\"No conversations have been had yet but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it,\" he said. \"Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke and Tyrell come back. My intention is to play first-team football at this club.\"",

      "The 20-year-old midfielder joins the Reds from the United States collegiate system, where she represented the University of Southern California’s USC Trojans. Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber. The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their new campaign underway against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 22.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is far from over as we creep towards deadline day for clubs across Europe.",
      "The window shall ceremoniously slam shut on Friday, August 30 and it is clear that United are still lacking in some areas of their squad. Erik ten Hag's side have not played a competitive fixture yet and already their defence is hanging by a thread with Leny Yoro confirmed to be out for months while; Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw are all doubts to face Manchester City at Wembley Stadium this weekend.",
      "MEN Sport understands the Reds are looking to make at least three new additions to their squad. Noussair Mazraoui is wanted should Wan-Bissaka be sold likewise Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt are of interest should Victor Lindelof depart.",
      "A central defensive midfielder is also desired but the Reds are struggling in this area considering Casemiro remains at the club. With United's business likely to go down to the wire, CoinPoker.com enlisted the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict how the window will end for the Reds.",
      "Despite United wanting to strengthen in defence and midfield, AI predicts Ineos will go all out to sign Ivan Toney this month. The technology believes the Reds will prepare a £62.5m bid for the Brentford striker which will be accepted due to the player's desire to play for a 'top club'.",
      "Unfortunately, AI also believes United's approach to bring Branthwaite to Old Trafford will fall short with negotiations between Everton and the Reds not progressing. If this were to happen, it would be highly disappointing for United and would mean that Ten Hag's side are once again lacking depth ahead of another long season.",

      "Manchester United's work in the transfer business is far from complete despite the Premier League season starting next weekend. Erik ten Hag has only managed to add two players to his squad so far but at least three more signings could be completed before the end of the month.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro cost a combined £95.41million earlier in the transfer window to add new blood to United's forward line and defence. However, Zirkzee has not featured for his new club in pre-season and Yoro's start to life in Manchester has started in the worst possible way with an injury that will see him miss the next three months.",
      "United unofficially kickstart the 2024/25 season with a date with city rivals Manchester City in the Community Shield on Saturday. Six days later, they host Fulham in the Premier League opener. In an ideal world, Ten Hag would have welcomed more players by then.",
      "Currently speaking, United's squad is in a worse position than it was last season. Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial have both left the club, Willy Kambwala has been sold and Sofyan Amrabat's loan spell came to an end. All four players were regulars in United's squad last term leaving Ten Hag to turn to academy starlets Harry Amass.",
      "One quick sweep of social media to gauge a reading of the fanbase and the trending question is United's lack of preparation going into the news season. MEN Sport understands that the club's recruitment has stalled amid the lack of movements with players leaving since Mason Greenwood's exit to Marseille.",
      "United are in three separate transfer sagas for three different positions: centre-back, central midfield and right-back. Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, Sander Berge, Youssouf Fofana and Noussair Mazraoui are all players targeted. But ultimately, players need to be sold before further business can be completed.",
      "With that being said, should United fans really be concerned about the lack of finished dealings before the Premier League starts? There's certainly a theory behind the worries. In Sir Alex Ferguson's final eight seasons in charge - winning five Premier League titles - United got all the transfer business done before their first league game of the season.",
      "In fact, minus Dimitar Berbatov's Deadline Day arrival in 2008, key players like Edwin Van Der Sar, Park Ji-Sung, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia, David De Gea and Robin van Persie all signed on the dotted line before Premier League football returned.",
      "When Ferguson left in 2013, Marouane Fellani arrived from Everton after David Moyes' first three games. In 2014, it was an even more extreme case. Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw were signed early but Marcos Rojo, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao all came after United's 2-1 home defeat to Swansea on the opening day.",
      "In fairness, of those seven players, only two or three worked out and the two big-names, Di Maria and Falcao, did not. 2015 saw an improvement, before Jose Mourinho's arrival in 2016 showed promising signs. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Eric Bailey were signed quickly and the Red Devils started the season brightly that saw them go 25 league games without defeat.",
      "Under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the 2019 and 2020 summers saw players join before the start of the season. In 2021, perhaps the club's biggest summer in the last decade, Jadon Sancho's long-standing transfer saga was completed early but the arrivals of Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo came later on.",
      "Now, Ronaldo's second stint in Manchester was not a failure. In 54 games, the striker scored 27 times. However, his strained relationship with Ten Hag and constant doubts over whether he hindered United meant the move will be remembered as one that happened to stop Manchester City from signing him.",
      "What does this tell us? Under a successful regime, under Alex Ferguson, United constantly got their targets through the door before Premier League football restarted. Under the shaky reigns, under Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Solskjaer, the nature of how transfer moves play out nowadays played a significant role in preparation.",
      "In an ideal world, United would welcome Marco Silva's Fulham to Old Trafford next Friday with a new No.6 to partner Kobbie Mainoo in midfield and a new face alongside Lisandro Martinez in defence. However, due to the failure to sell players and Ineos being considerate in their spending, United could see 32-year-old Casemiro start in midfield and one of Harry Maguire or Victor Lindelof, who could be sold this summer, start.",
      "Poor planning or just unfortunate? Whatever the major reason is, United know that acting recklessly in the window after the start of the season hasn't proved to breed good results in the last 19 years.",

      "If new arrival Joshua Zirkzee was any more laidback, he would be horizontal.",
      "Manchester United's first signing of the summer was incredibly relaxed in his first interview with club media last month and it doesn't seem like much would bother him. Zirkzee was also nonchalant when discussing which shirt number he might be given, when some might demand a certain number on the back of their shirts due to their egos.",
      "Anyone who has watched Zirkzee speak since he signed for United would have been disarmed by his warm, laidback character, but in terms of what he's going to be like on the pitch, a large contingent of supporters still don't know what to expect from the Dutchman this season.",
      "Bologna defied the odds to finish in the Italian top four last term, enjoying their best season since 1967/1968, and Zirkzee started 32 out of a possible 38 league games. Zirkzee, a product of Bayern Munich's academy, contributed 11 goals and five assists in those appearances and although he wasn't prolific, that was a decent return and the 23-year-old received a late call-up to the Netherlands squad for this summer's European Championship.",
      "Wout Weghorst was preferred as the backup striker to Zirkzee at that tournament in Germany but United will be tremendously disappointed if he doesn't perform better than Weghorst did during his time on loan at Old Trafford.",
      "Zirkzee is at the start of his career and the workhorse Weghorst is near the end of his. The 32-year-old gave his all during his time wearing a United shirt in 2022/23, but he lacked quality and that shouldn't be a problem for Zirkzee, who has demonstrated his potential.",

      "£43",
      "When Rasmus Hojlund is fit, he will be the first-choice although Zirkzee should put him under pressure and will be intent on displacing him. Zirkzee has operated as a striker for most of his career but recently warned, in an interview with The Mirror, that he isn't a traditional No.9.",
      "“I occasionally drop down to midfield. I don't do that for myself but to help the team. I am what I call a false striker,\" he said. \"Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5! That's my game. Maybe I'm a little different than others. But being different is good, right?”",
      "The thought of a player describing themselves as a '9.5' is enough for the football traditionalist to pull their hair out in frustration, but if you ignore the footballing hipster term the comment is interesting.",
      "Zirkzee can play anywhere across the attacking line and clearly doesn't consider himself a natural centre-forward, but that's who United need him to be in the first weeks of the season. Hojlund is injured and Erik ten Hag has discussed the possibility of playing Amad and Jadon Sancho down the middle, yet neither have the level of experience of Zirkzee in that role.",
      "\"Joshua Zirkzee, he is coming in, he has started training,\" said Ten Hag last week. “But consider that he is not so long in training, so that will take time, and he has to adapt to English football and our way of playing as well. So there is also, of course, Jadon [Sancho] as a striker.”",
      "Ten Hag suggested Zirkzee could be eased into action after returning to pre-season later due to the Netherlands' exploits at Euro 2024 but that should have changed when Hojlund sustained an injury. United didn't score enough goals last season and the attack will be further blunted if Sancho plays centrally - Zirkzee is a better option and must start in the Community Shield.",
      "While Zirkzee might not be fit enough to play 90 minutes, he must be thrown into the deep end and whether he sinks or swims at Wembley on Saturday will be down to him. Zirkzee is needed sooner than expected and more will be known about him imminently.",

      "There was a slight shift in Erik ten Hag's body language when he was asked about Casemiro's future during our sit-down at UCLA last week.",
      "My colleague's question, verbatim, was: \"Casemiro had a bit of a dip last season, Erik. He didn't play in the FA Cup final. How is your relationship with him and how do you think he will play for United this season?\"",
      "\"You have to make choices,\" Ten Hag stressed. \"We need a squad, and at that time also we needed a squad and what was needed for that particular game. But he is a very important player. He is a leader and he can make a difference for our team. I talk in general, but it is for all the players. And no-one can play every game, it's impossible.\"",
      "\"Do you expect him to stay though, Casemiro?\"",
      "\"I...... Well...... All the players who are there, if they want to play for us, want to play for the badge and they have the quality, then I hope they keep contributing to our team. We have seen that Casimiro in his career is so successful.\"",
      "The hesitation after 'I' and 'well' were telling. The FA Cup final was shaping up to be Casemiro's last dance on his last legs yet he played his way out of the team through his selfless yet incongruous presence at centre back in the weeks preceding the match.",
      "Sofyan Amrabat's Lazarus-like return convinced Ten Hag to select the younger defensive midfielder and he was entirely vindicated. Amrabat inflicted a first defeat on opposite number Rodri in 74 matches.",
      "Amrabat is still peculiarly listed among the first team players on the official United website. Supporters who are not transfer-tittle-tattle junkies might have wondered where Amrabat was during the tour. The Africa Cup of Nations took place in January and February, after all..",
      "The truth is Amrabat is a Fiorentina player, not a United one. United sources say the rationale for Amrabat's continued presence is he could yet sign for the club permanently. If he were to do so in the final three weeks of the transfer window, it would not be a ringing endorsement of a player United negotiated an option to buy for nearly a year ago.",
      "Amrabat has not been training with Fiorentina and it was noticeable he donned United shorts for a fitness video uploaded onto his Instagram page two weeks ago. United would be right not to proceed with a permanent move for a player who excelled during that defining run-in though they judged the manager on one game, rather than the other 51 games.",
      "United effectively have four senior midfielders: Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo, Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen. Eriksen is best-known as a playmaker and McTominay is a final-third player. Mason Mount highlighted he is more comfortable in the final, rather than middle, third during a productive pre-season.",
      "Midfield ought to have been the priority for United. A new No.6 to complement Mainoo. But, as Ten Hag noted last week, their positions are \"occupied\". Under profitability and sustainability rules, United cannot stockpile departments where the weekly wage bill is well is around £750,000.",
      "United had the finances and leverage to bring in Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro as high earners Anthony Martial and Raphael Varane came off the payroll on July 1. Hence why fees were agreed for Zirkzee and Yoro within the first two weeks of last month.",
      "It has gone quiet on centre halves Jarrad Branthwaite and Matthijs de Ligt as Victor Lindelof, the great survivor, has still not been shifted. Lindelof only played two halves across United's five pre-season friendlies due to an ominous \"niggle\". For Noussair Mazraoui to come, Aaron Wan-Bissaka must go.",

      "With Ultra HD included at no extra cost, football fans can enjoy the 2024/25 season with crystal clear picture quality.",
      "£43",
      "United logically triggered the one-year extension in Lindelof's contract in the winter yet must regret that now. He missed 21 games through injury last season and the 30-year-old is a tough sell. So is Casemiro.",
      "In midfield, United have no space. A competitive debut beckons for tour breakout Toby Collyer and his playing time in the United States, as well as his performances, offer encouragement.",
      "Ten Hag made a beeline for Collyer, in his tracksuit, on the Wembley pitch after the FA Cup final and insisted on attending his signing ceremony for a new contract last month.",
      "\"I think it's a massive boost,\" Collyer said in San Diego. \"It shows obviously he rates me as a player.\" United's off-the-ball work in the FA Cup final was vital and it is no coincidence that came with Casemiro a spectator in the stands.",
      "\"I'd say with me, a lot of my work is off the ball as well,\" Collyer clarified. \"Predominantly, I'm a really busy player, I like to get about the pitch. And an area of my game I'd like to improve on is in possession so I think the only way you're going to get better is by demanding the ball, getting on it and not backing away from situations when you could.\"",
      "United need and want to bring down the average age of their midfield. Eriksen is expected to see out his final year at the club but Casemiro is only halfway through a four-year contract. The price has not been right for McTominay from Fulham.",
      "Casemiro was a signing orchestrated by former football director John Murtough than Ten Hag, who coveted Frenkie de Jong. Little wonder there was a slight shift from Ten Hag at the Casemiro question.",

When he eventually returned in January, the striker bagged four goals in five Premier League matches but finished the season without adding to that tally.",
      "The England international has made it clear that he wishes to make a move to a 'top club' this summer but at 28, nobody has decided to take the gamble yet. Reports on Wednesday suggested United still held an interest in Toney to provide competition for Hojlund who will miss the first three weeks of the season with injury.",
      "United have already added Joshua Zirkzee to their squad this summer but Scholes explained to The Overlap Fan Debate that he is worried neither the former Bologna forward or Hojlund can get the same return up front as Toney. \"You have got to look at the forward players,\" Scholes explained.",
      "\"Could Hojlund score 25 goals for us this season? I would be amazed, I’d be surprised.",

      "Manchester United are known to be in the market for a new midfielder this summer and they have already been linked with plenty of possible transfers.",
      "United were heavily linked with a move for Benfica's teenage star Joao Neves before his £50million move to PSG, and that was believed to open up a move for Les Parisiens' midfielder Manuel Ugarte.",
      "However, PSG are not moving away from their €60million (£51.65million) and, as things stand, United are not pursuing a move at that price.",
      "Instead, they have been linked with a move for Burnley midfielder Sander Berge, who the Clarets are willing to sell, as well as Monaco midfielder Youssouf Fofana.",
      "Burnley want £30million for Norway international Berge, while a similar price would have to be paid to prise Fofana, who is in the final year of his contract at Monaco, away from Stade Louis II.",
      "So who should United be prioritising in their midfield? MEN Sport writers have offered their view.",
      "United were forced to be creative to sign Amrabat last summer, stumping up a hefty €10million loan fee and including an option to make the deal permanent for £25m.",
      "Perhaps that is the approach they should take to land Ugarte, as PSG's valuation of the midfielder is thought to be unrealistic. The Uruguay international is clearly a classier operator than Berge and would provide the quality that is required to protect the defensive line.",
      "I said before the window had opened that United's priority should be replacing Casemiro and with the deadline looming closer, they need a fresh face through the door. United won't be held to ransom with their transfer targets and the loan market could provide a solution to sign Ugarte.",
      "If worst comes to worst, United still haven't ruled out signing Amrabat on a permanent deal - although the clause inserted in the loan has expired - and he is a sensible back-up option.",
      "Berge's apparent emergence onto United's radar suggests they are not limiting their options to signing a trademark defensive-midfielder, more commonly known as a 'No.6' these days. The Norwegian is more of a box-to-box type player, who will progressive the ball with driving runs.",
      "United's biggest flaw last season was the lack of a world-class operator at the base of the engine room. Casemiro regressed and the need for an upgrade in that area of the team is paramount.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has established himself as a forward-thinking player, meaning United need to accompany with him with an elite-level destroyer to give him the license and the confidence to venture forward and support Bruno Fernandes higher up the pitch. Of all of the midfielders United have been linked with, Ugarte fits the profile most for what is needed.",
      "He has the defensive capacity and knowledge to sit at the base of the engine room and provide the level of aggression that is required. Fofana and Berge are renowned for being a little more adventurous in their respective styles of play, but will be cheaper to attain.",
      "Finances, just like with any transfer at any club in the world, will dictate what is and what is not possible. However, if United can ramp up the number of exits before the deadline and generate as much cash as possible, they should not give up on Ugarte just yet.",
      "United have identified a new number six as a transfer priority but they are also in the market for other areas of reinforcement and they will have to cut their cloth accordingly in the transfer market.",
      "Deals for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee have already seen United part with the best part of £90million and they are also in the market for Bayern Munich defenders Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs De Ligt.",
      "So while Ugarte may be the most eye-catching target, if they can save over £20million by signing Berge or Fofana as an alternative, that can be reinvested in other transfer deals, then that seems the most sensible solution.",
      "The question then is whether United see Fofana as a safer bet than Berge, who has Premier League experience with both Sheffield United and Burnley.",
      "Yes, he has suffered relegation on two occasions, but that shouldn't put United off. Liverpool have had great success (Andy Robertson, Georginio Wijnaldum, Xherdan Shaqiri) in recent years by signing players from relegated clubs and Berge can have a similar impact at Old Trafford.",
      "With that all taken into account, a move for the Norwegian who Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was keen to sign, makes the most sense.",
      "Fofana is the type of opportunistic signing United should continue to pursue this summer. The midfielder is in the same contractual situation as the one the Reds capitalised on when signing his compatriot Leny Yoro from Lille after entering the final 12 months of his deal.",
      "Similarly to Joshua Zirkzee's Bologna release clause, United would have leverage in negotiations to sign the France international. That was not the case with Manuel Ugarte, who has four years remaining on his Paris Saint-Germain contract, which compelled the Parisian club to demand £50million for the player despite signing Joao Neves themselves.",
      "While there would also be leverage in talks with Burnley to sign Berge following their relegation, the midfielder still has three years remaining on his contract, which could compel the Championship club to hold out for a higher fee.",
      "Fofana has also previously played with Raphael Varane for the French national team, and the now departed United player could help convince his countryman to choose Old Trafford should other interest emerge, with Arsenal and West Ham United previously being linked in the midfielder.",
      "Looking at the options on the table, the straightforward answer is to pick which player should not be signed - Sander Berge. The Burnley man is a perfectly fine addition if the Reds were planning on going for a mid-table finish this coming season but they aren't.",
      "Berge may well come good but at 26 he isn't a young prospect anymore who could come good. He has struggled in the Premier League at two clubs who have vastly different objectives to United and he ultimately seems a left-field option.",
      "As for who I would sign, Youssouf Fofana appears to be the most sensible option. He is a year younger than Berge and has more experience of playing at a high level.",
      "He would be significantly cheaper than Manuel Ugarte too which cannot be underestimated considering the current climate in the Premier League. Fofana could be a steal at just under £30m.",
      "As the most expensive (and laborious), Ugarte can be ruled out immediately here. United's interest in him had some immediate red flags and the fact that nothing could be agreed is going to save a lot of time and energy in covering up his shortcomings.",
      "Landing on Berge and Fofana could be a really good ending though. They are both cheaper options who have more well-rounded games. they offer plenty defensively (much like Ugarte) but certainly have more on the ball. Fofana, in particular, can be effective bringing the ball forward.",
      "For what could be around £25million, either player would be a big addition, even if not a flashy one. Berge at a better team really could prove to be an inspired buy, whilst Fofana has looked ready for the step up himself for at least a year.",
      "Both players are of a similar age and still have different characteristics but there isn't a standout. As the impressive international, Fofana is more glossy as opposed to Berge who just keeps getting relegated. The Burnley man has Premier League experience though, which boosts his argument. Either way, United would be getting a good player for nearly half the cost of Ugarte, and they offer much more.",
      "United find themselves in a difficult position. Hardly a transfer window, seemingly, goes by without them needing to sign another midfielder and that's, once again, the case this summer.",
      "They have been among the worst buyers - and sellers - in elite football for more than a decade now and Ineos will in the first instance need to repair previous mistakes. However, it might not be as simple as going out and getting an ideal replacement for Casemiro.",
      "An initial four-player shortlist - comprising Martin Zubimendi, Adrien Rabiot, Sofyan Amrabat and Manuel Ugarte - threw up countless pros and cons. Some too cheap, some too expensive, some not even holding midfielders at all.",
      "Genuine, top-class No.6s are not exactly a saturated market this summer, so it might be better for United to stick with what they know and take up their option on Amrabat for a relatively cost-effective £20million.",
      "In theory, that would give them six or 12 months to consider a better long-term solution and not be forced into panic buying. That's an unwanted trait which has got them into this particular midfield pickle before.",

      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",

Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",

He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "With just two new faces coming through the door it is clear United need to step up their efforts to get players off the books. A handful of members of Erik ten Hag's squad have been heavily linked with exits to various clubs, but nothing has come to fruition since Mason Greenwood finalised his move to Marseille on July 18.",
      "In United's defence, as is proving the case with their own recruitment, it was always anticipated that a lot of Premier League clubs would leave the bulk of their transfer business until quite late on this summer as a result of the European Championship and the Copa America taking place in June and July. Players who were at those tournaments then went away on holidays, meaning the rate at which business has been done has slowed.",
      "But with exactly three weeks to go, United are now in a race against time to get their wheeling and dealing done. It is no secret they want to sign another centre-back and source a much-needed holding midfielder, plus whatever else Ten Hag may believe is necessary, but for that to be possible they need to generate funds via player sales, with their net spend currently around the £50m mark.",

Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof, Hannibal Mejbri and Christian Eriksen now have less than 12 months remaining on their current deals and none of them have a long-term part to play in Ten Hag's plans.",
      "Wan-Bissaka is continuing to generate interest from West Ham United and Inter Milan, while Hannibal has been heavily linked with Rangers. Suitors for Lindelof and Eriksen have not been as forthcoming and United are not understood to be actively trying to push the latter out the door.",
      "Scott McTominay and Facundo Pellistri have also entered the final 12 months of their deals at Old Trafford but United have the option to extend their stays by an additional year. McTominay has been the subject of heavy interest from Fulham and the Reds are open to letting him go if they receive an offer of £25m-£30m, which so far nobody has submitted.",
      "Pellistri needs to leave for the sake of his own career. He spent the second half of last season out on loan and the speed at which Amad has developed in recent months has further dented his hopes of becoming a starter at Old Trafford.",
      "There are also cases for United to try and cash-in on Jadon Sancho and Casemiro before the bell, but they under longer contracts. Sancho, however, could still leave if Paris Saint-Germain submit an enterprising offer.",

      "Manchester United defender Will Fish has suffered torn ligaments and is set to be sidelined for up to five weeks.",
      "Fish came on at half-time in the 3-0 friendly defeat to Liverpool in South Carolina on Saturday but was carried off injured after committing a foul.",
      "United manager Erik ten Hag walked onto the pitch to check on Fish’s well-being and it is understood he had a scan on his return to United’s Carrington training complex on Monday. Sources say Fish did not suffer a fracture and the prognosis is better than Fish had expected.",
      "The setback all but rules out a transfer for Fish, who has generated interest from Championship clubs. The 21-year-old's contract expires next year but United have the option of an additional year.",
      "Before the injury, Fish was told he would not be sold unless there was another incoming at centre half due to new signing Leny Yoro’s fractured metatarsal that could rule him out until November. United sold centre back Willy Kambwala last month and released Raphael Varane.",
      "United's five most senior centre backs suffered either an injury or illness during their tour of the United States. Harry Maguire was left out of the Liverpool game as a precaution, Victor Lindelof was taken off at half-time as a precaution and Jonny Evans came off at the same time as he was unwell.",
      "United have had bids of £43million and £50m rejected by Everton for defender Jarrad Branthwaite and they remain interested in Bayern Munich centre back Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Fish has spent the last two years primarily on loan at Hibernian and his sole competitive appearance for United was at Wolves in May 2021. The academy graduate appeared in all five of United’s pre-season friendlies.",
      "United's touring players were given Monday and Tuesday off ahead of the Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley on Saturday.",

      "Paul Scholes believes Manchester United have dodged a bullet by walking away from potentially signing Amadou Onana from Everton.",
      "The 22-year-old had been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford with Erik ten Hag keen to bolster his midfield to help ahead of another title push. However, Onana completed the £50million move to Aston Villa instead, putting pen-to-paper on a five-year deal.",
      "He has big boots to fill following the exit of Douglas Luiz who was the long-standing maestro of the team before joining Juventus. The Belgium international, who is highly-rated, played every minute of their Euro 2024 campaign before they were knocked out to France in the round-of-16.",
      "However, United legend Scholes believes Villa overpaid for Onana's services and was pleased to see his former club did not oblige to Everton's demands.",
      "\"He [Luiz] had to go for financial reasons and I think he'll be a big miss. I thought he was brilliant for them,\" Scholes said during The Overlap'slatest fan debate. \"Now it's who comes in to replace him?\"",
      "\"I don't really see the Onana thing either. I didn't see it while he was at Everton, I didn't see it at Belgium either. When they said £50m for him I just thought: 'ooh, that sounds a little bit too much'.",
      "\"Look, [Unai] Emery being the manager that he is, he might get something out of him. It might be a club that suits him - I don't know. But, where I'm stood now, £50m for him just seems like a lot of money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher who sat alongside Scholes, added: \"I was never really impressed with him much at Everton.

      "Manchester United's transfer link to Burnley midfielder Sander Berge has left supporters above boiling point. A quick scan across social media and YouTube, you will come across hundreds of points why United shouldn't sign him.",
      "Berge, 26, emerged as one of United's midfield transfer targets this week after they reportedly decided to withdraw their interest in Paris Saint-Germain star Manuel Ugarte. However, after suffering two relegations from the Premier League with Sheffield United and Burnley, doubts over his ability to perform at the top of English football have flooded any positivity.",
      "One point that is a constant on social media is the lack of suitors for his services. For example, when Leicester City were relegated in 2023, at least three teams wanted to sign James Maddison. When Southampton went down, James Ward-Prowse's move to West Ham came after the likes of Tottenham were keen.",
      "It's believed among the fanbase that Berge would be viewed as a 'panic signing' - despite the window not closing for over 20 days - yet the recruitment team at Old Trafford are seemingly testing the water with Burnley's resolve. According to reports, talks are underway with the Championship side over a potential deal.",
      "Under new sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is taking the lead of United's transfer business, it's hardly a surprise that he is on their radar. When Ashworth was at Newcastle, he attempted to bring the Norwegian to St James' Park at the start of 2023.",
      "“I was prepared to go and play a cup match, first and foremost, and was looking forward to it. I had visitors and people would come and watch a match. It didn’t turn out that way and I was told that I was not part of the squad.",
      "“Then it was a bit like that back and forth. The club and my agents tried to see what was possible to achieve. There was interest there. It never got to the point where I needed to make a choice. I wasn’t very involved. It passed, then I was playing matches again. There will be speculation. The boys know how to make a bit of fun out of it.",
      "“I see that it can look like that from the outside, that it will be the same pattern every time, but I don’t stress,” Berge added. “Teammates and people around joke a bit about it when it comes up again and again, but for me it’s just about focusing on football.”",

      "How good will it be to see Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez starting together on Saturday?",
      "The pair last started together when Manchester United played West Ham at Old Trafford on February 4, a game that was marred by Martinez picking up another injury.",
      "He sustained an injury to the medial collateral ligament in his knee and returned for the final home game of the league season, but Shaw was ruled out for the remainder of the campaign two weeks after the West Ham victory when suffering an injury against Luton Town.",
      "Both Martinez and Shaw missed large parts of last season and their respective absences at different periods were undoubtedly a factor in the team's spectacular regression. They are left-footed players who are crucial in build-up play.",
      "“We have missed him [in] every game because he brings a composure in the team and a calmness in the team and, at the same time, a winning attitude,\" said Ten Hag when about Martinez's absence last season. He can express this very clearly, he can transfer that to the team and that contributes to our levels.”",
      "He continued: \"It's not an advantage. Everyone knows my philosophy, to have Licha Martinez and Luke Shaw, two left-footed [defenders]. Also, we haven't had Tyrell Malacia available. So all the way, all the time this season, we have to make compromises. And that is not in our advantage. But today we managed it and hopefully it's not too bad with Luke.”",
      "If you asked Ten Hag which two players he wouldn't want to lose for a prolonged period due to injury in a campaign, there's a high chance he would say Martinez and Shaw. Martinez was outstanding in his first season after signing from Ajax, setting the tone in the dressing room and on the pitch, and his passing ability makes him a unique option.",
      "Shaw is also one of the finest left-backs in Europe when he's fit and at his best, although unfortunately, he struggled to maintain a clean bill of health throughout 2023/24. The new season is a clean slate and Martinez and Shaw must stay fit. They are two of Ten Hag's favourite players and their campaign should start at Wembley on Saturday when United take on Manchester City in the Community Shield.",
      "Shaw was asked about his injuries at the beginning of June and said: “No one knows the situation, what’s been happening. Obviously, I think people have seen that there was a setback, but I was actually very close to returning to team training. I think it was the day before.",
      "“In my opinion, I was pushing to try and get back for the games and the final and I think I pushed too hard. I came back too quick and I actually ended up getting another injury in my hamstring, which was a (grade) 2c. That was three weeks from the final and they said it was a six-week injury, so that’s obviously why there was that setback.",
      "“I think people have been getting confused with what’s actually happened because nothing had ever been said. That’s why I did my post. I got a few people coming up to me, saying, ‘how can you not be fit for United and (can) for England?’",
      "“But the circumstances were that I did push to do everything I can to be fit for United, and that’s been really my whole season. It’s been disappointing for me, but I want to do everything I can, first and foremost, for United.",
      "“That’s my club, I’ve been there for a long time but, of course, that wasn’t the case, so that was hard to obviously take in the last few weeks. But I’m here now and I’m still not there yet, I’ve still got a while to go, but I’m trying to do everything I can to make it happen.”",
      "There is evidence Shaw was perhaps mishandled by the medical staff last season. That cannot happen again because United's fortunes this term could hinge on whether the club's longest-serving player and Martinez stay fit and avoid injury, such is their importance to the team.",
      "United fans will be delighted to see Martinez and Shaw's names on the starting team sheet on Saturday if they get the nod to face City in the Community Shield.",

      "One of the biggest issues facing Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is how he gets the best out of Marcus Rashford.",
      "After an incredible 2022/23 season which yielded 30 goals in all competitions, it was expected that Rashford would lead United in Ten Hag's second season to really challenge Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "But United fell from fourth place to eighth place and it wasn't helped by a huge downturn in Rashford's form which ended in him being snubbed for the England squad for EURO 2024.",
      "The 26-year-old managed just eight goals in all competitions last term and those numbers simply have to improve if United want to improve their league position and, on a personal level, if he is to force his way back into the England squad.",
      "But how does Ten Hag go about doing that? Greater support in his current role with new signings? A formation change? A positional change? Or does he need to leave United to truly thrive? MEN Sport writers have offered their view ahead of a crucial season in Rashford's career.",
      "Rashford's exploits in 2022/23 demonstrated that United have a world-class player on their hands when he is at the peak of his powers. He was outstanding in Erik ten Hag's first season at the club, scoring 30 goals in a single season for the first time in his career.",
      "He oozed confidence and he looked like scoring every time he got in and around the penalty area. Much of his good fortune stemmed from his relationship with Luke Shaw down United's left side.",
      "The England duo had a terrific understanding of each other's traits, with Shaw often bombing forward on the overlap when Rashford ventured inside on his stronger right foot. United, however, were denied that combination all too often last season because of the former's injury issues.",
      "However, Shaw has now worked his way back to full fitness and will be determined to avoid a repeat of last season's frustrations. February's 4-3 win over Wolves at Molineux, particularly in the first half, provided enough evidence to showcase how much more effective Rashford is when he is partnered down the left with his fellow countryman.",
      "If Shaw can maintain his fitness, that will go a long way towards helping Rashford reach his best levels. Fingers crossed.",
      "If United are to have a successful season then it is pretty clear they need Rashford firing at the levels of 2022/23. He was United's most important player as they won the Carabao Cup, reached the FA Cup final and qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Yes, injuries hurt United last season but Rashford's downturn in form did not help either. What he needs is consistent games out on the left-wing, a consistent side playing alongside him to help him thrive, and, crucially, Luke Shaw remaining fit at left-back.",
      "Rashford and Shaw have enjoyed a successful relationship at both club and international level but he managed just 12 Premier League appearances because of injuries last term.",
      "Compare that to 31 appearances the season prior and it is clear to see the benefit Rashford receives from playing with his preferred partner on the left-hand side.",
      "The signing of Joshua Zirkzee should help United get the best out of Rashford to start this season. Despite standing at 6ft 4in, he calls himself a \"false striker\" and a nine-and-a-half, tending to drop into midfield rather than always leading the line.",
      "Doing so should provide the space for Rashford to push ahead of Zirkzee, as he has previously done when playing alongside Harry Kane for England and did so well during the FA Cup final. Bruno Fernandes was the 'false nine' that day, and signing Zirkzee should allow Erik ten Hag to play that way more often, especially with Rasmus Hojlund missing the start of the season.",
      "Beginning the campaign with Fernandes or Jadon Sancho potentially deployed as the furthest player forward would be the best way to set up Rashford for success. After using Sancho there last pre-season, Ten Hag started Rashford in that role once the competitive games came around.",
      "The manager cannot revert to that if he wants to get the best out of his player. Ten Hag has to accept that Rashford is no longer as effective as he once was as a number nine.",
      "Marcus Rashford must put the underwhelming season he had last term behind him and look to reproduce the heights he did during the 2022/23 campaign. As one of the most important players in the United squad, his contribution will be key to United having a successful season this year.",
      "It's clear to see that injuries to Luke Shaw last season had a major impact in the squad and consequently meant that Rashford netted just seven goals in 33 Premier League games. Both have enjoyed a successful spell at Old Trafford and Shaw's absence played a part in the team's lack of goals as well as it being their their worst finish (eighth) in 34 years.",
      "Having recently returned to full fitness, Shaw is expected to play a key role to ensure a repeat of last season is avoided.",
      "Rashford has plenty to offer Manchester United still. A player who scored 30 goals just over a year ago doesn't become bad overnight.",
      "It's not all positional for Rashford either, it seems that there are conditions that have to be met off the field to get the best out of him. He is a complex character who needs to fit in and feel the love of his coach. When that lacks, and the environment as a whole turns sour, he doesn't offer his best.",
      "That often comes from the left though. Rashford has not been a natural striker for a while and with two No.9s signed in the past year for over £100million combined, it indicates that he won't be played their much. Competition on the left is strong with Alejandro Garnacho, but Rashford is a flexible player.",
      "When cutting in and playing on transition he has all the weapons to be a dangerous forward. If things function around him, perhaps with a fit full-back or a non-vacant midfield, then there is reason to think he can get back to being the threat he has been before. Rashford has so much still to give that it is too soon right him off.",
      "The frustration around Marcus Rashford last season arose from what came before. The forward plundered 30 goals in 2022/2023 and that's not to mention the three that came for England at the World Cup in Qatar that very winter. At his absolute best, the Academy graduate is capable of single-handedly winning matches, and being the talisman that Erik ten Hag needs for United to propel themselves back into the top-four positions.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly taken a significant step in their pursuit of Burnley midfielder Sander Berge.",
      "The Norwegian emerged as a surprise target for the Red Devils as Erik ten Hag is keen to welcome a midfielder following the arrivals of Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro last month. Berge arrived in England from Belgian side Genk in January 2020, joining Sheffield United for a fee in the region of £22million.",
      "Last year, Berge completed the move to Burnley and could be on the move again after a brief spell with the Clarets. According to TEAMtalk, Berge has said yes to joining United and a 'tempting bid' is thought to being prepared.",
      "Sky Sports journalist Dharmesh Sheth has added that talks with the Lancashire team have initiated and there is hope he could be secured for a cut-price fee after Burnley relegation from the Premier League last season. United are in the position of trying to sign a holding midfielder because of Casemiro's unexpected decline last season.",
      "He failed to provide the same level of defensive nous that he did in the 2022/23 campaign. United's attention turned to Berge after deeming Paris Saint-Germain's £51m (€60m) valuation on Manuel Ugarte 'too high.'",
      "Elsewhere, Fulham have backed away from their pursuit in Scott McTominay. That's according to The Times who claim the Cottagers have cooled their interest after a second bid worth £20m was rejected.",
      "Fulham weren't the only team interested in McTominay with Turkish giants Galatasaray previously making their admiration for him known. However, after seeing their offers turned down, it's claimed they have given up their pursuit as they cannot afford the reported £30m asking price.",

      "Manchester United are still reportedly hopeful of securing a deal for Brentford's £40million-rated striker Ivan Toney, who could significantly alter Erik ten Hag's attacking otions.",
      "Toney, 28, is in the final year of his contract with Brentford, and it's believed the club would be open to negotiations around the £40million mark. The England international has been frequently linked with a move to Old Trafford, although United's decision to spend £36m on Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee in July seemed to have ended their interest.",
      "However, it soon became apparent that United were keen to sign another forward during the summer transfer window, a need which has intensified since Rasmus Hojlund was recently sidelined for the first few weeks of the season, leaving Zirkzee as the only senior option up front. Due to his participation in Euro 2024 for the Netherlands, the Dutchman didn't play in any of United's pre-season friendlies and is unlikely to start in Saturday's Community Shield match against Manchester City.",
      "This leaves Ten Hag with limited options for now, but if United can secure Toney, there are several ways they could set up for the 2024-25 Premier League season. We look at what Ten Hag's ideal front three might look like - and more options.",
      "Jadon Sancho has endured a rather inconsistent career at Old Trafford, but this season could feel like a fresh start for him. After making up with Ten Hag following his contribution to Borussia Dortmund's Champions League final run during his loan spell, he is eager to establish himself as a regular at United, three years after his initial arrival.",
      "His playing style would nicely complement Marcus Rashford's more straightforward approach on the left wing. Rashford is keen to silence his critics after also missing out on Euro 2024, just like Sancho.",
      "Neither of them have played alongside Toney before, but the Brentford talisman's physical presence in the centre would allow Rashford and Sancho to make runs behind and benefit from flick-ons and Toney's renowned hold-up play.",
      "Nothing excites Old Trafford more than a winger swiftly charging down the wings, so why not two?",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was one of Ten Hag's most frequently used players last season, and it's hard to believe he's still only 20. He certainly deserves a starting spot and could even challenge Rashford on the left flank if Sancho - or either Amad or Antony - is chosen on the right.",
      "Despite their disappointing 2023-24 campaign, scoring goals wasn't the biggest issue for United when these three players were on the pitch together. The challenge for Ten Hag was injuries, prompting him to seek two new strikers to ease the load off Hojlund.",
      "At just 21, the Danish player could benefit from teaming up with the more seasoned Toney, who has also proven his ability to make a significant impact as a substitute for England.",
      "Throughout most of Ten Hag's tenure, he has favoured a 4-2-3-1 formation, with two wingers supporting a single striker. However, last season saw the former Ajax manager occasionally employ a 4-4-2 diamond both in and out of possession, with Bruno Fernandes sometimes taking on the No. 9 role and Scott McTominay sitting slightly deeper, such as in May's FA Cup final victory.",
      "Considering that Zirkzee recently confessed to being a \"nine-and-a-half\", why not play him alongside Toney (or Hojlund) with Fernandes orchestrating the game from behind? Both Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo possess the all-round skills to function as shuttling midfielders, and McTominay has previously played this role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "This formation would also provide Casemiro with additional cover in the No. 6 position ahead of what is expected to be a pivotal season for many at Old Trafford.",

      "The former striker has returned to Old Trafford almost 20 years after he left the club to join Real Madrid in 2006. He went into coaching after hanging up his boots and after his working his way up the career ladder, landed his first job in senior management in March 2022 at PSV Eindhoven.",

      "It's fair to say that Manchester United's search for a new No.6 hasn't exactly gone to plan. Following the early decision not to make Sofyan Amrabat's loan permanent, United's attempt at signing a new midfielder before the start of the 2024/25 season is hanging by a thread.",
      "For some time, Paris Saint-Germain star Manuel Ugarte was the leading candidate to move to Old Trafford. With personal terms not thought to be a problem, the Ligue 1 club's asking price of £51million (€60m) has proved to be a stumbling block with reports claiming that the club have withdrawn their interest for now.",
      "Alternatives are now being looked at and over the last 24 hours, a list of new names have emerged. Amid talk of the highly-rated Real Sociedad star Martin Zubimendi and AS Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, a surprise link for Burnley's Sander Berge has left some bamboozled.",
      "Berge, 26, has spent the last three-and-a-half seasons in England at Sheffield United and Burnley. The Blades paid £22m for Berge's services in January 2020 after his impressive performances in Belgium before he moved to Turf Moor for just £12m last August.",
      "He recorded a third relegation from the Premier League with Burnley last term, prompting many to already throw shade over his possible arrival at Old Trafford. If reports are to be believed, United face paying up to £30m for Berge this summer.",
      "In today's market, which sees clubs forced to pay a premium for players despite concerns over Financial Fair Play rules, it's not quite clear why United would even entertain Burnley's valuation. First of all, let's consider his defensive statistics. According to FBRef, the Norway international ranks in the top 91st percentile for aerials won and 83rd percentile for completed passes compared to positional peers in Europe's Big 5 leagues.",
      "Compared to Ugarte, Berge completed more passes per 90 minutes, more shot-creating actions and boasts a better tackling success rate. However, as a No.6, Ugarte is simply better. The Uruguay international attempted and won more tackles, made more interceptions and won more tackles in the three different areas of the pitch.",
      "Certain mitigating factors do determine these stats such as Burnley's constant battle at the bottom of the Premier League compared to PSG's dominance in France. However, taking Ugarte out of it completely, there's a problem with Berge that United simply can't overlook.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro, United's first two signings this summer, both represent quality at a young age alongside promising future market value. For many years, the club has overpaid for players and lost millions on them when the time came to depart - Paul Pogba, Donny van de Beek, Antony Martial and many more.",
      "When Berge emerged as one of Scandavia's brightest talents at Genk after three years in Belgium, he was valued at £18.9m (€22m) by Transfermarkt. Unbelievably, that figure has never increased. In fact, at the end of his second season at Sheffield United (2022), his market value had fallen to £13.7m (€16m).",
      "After winning promotion back to the Premier League in 2020, it increased slightly to £17m (€20m), where it remains now. That is £13m less than the reported £30m that Burnley are demanding for the midfielder this summer.",
      "That means that since seeing his market value fly from £7.7m to £18.9m at Genk, Berge's merit in the transfer market has dropped across the last four years. On the other hand, Ugarte's market value has only risen since his breakthrough in Europe.",
      "When he signed for Sporting CP in 2021, he was valued at £5.1m (€6m), two years later he brought in over £50m. Before PSG's clear stance of wanting away with him, his value reached £51.5m, the figure that the French giants are holding out for.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly still interested in signing Brentford striker Ivan Toney this summer.",
      "The 28-year-old has been a standout star for the Bees since joining the club from Peterborough United in 2020. Toney's goals have propelled Brentford to the Premier League and in 2022/23 the forward became hot property when he scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League appearances.",
      "However, his momentum took a turn for the worst last season when he was banned by the FA over gambling offences. He returned to the Brentford squad in January and in preparation for his return stressed he wanted a move to a 'bigger club' in the summer.",
      "Toney would go on to score four goals in his first five Premier League appearances back from suspension but only managed one assist, against United, in the remainder of the season. Such a drop off in form has dampened a desire to sign Toney this summer.",
      "While he looked lively during the European Championships, few feel he is worth the original price tag of £100m that Thomas Frank placed on him. As the summer transfer window winds down, no 'bigger clubs' have come in for Toney and his price tag has been slashed as a consequence.",
      "According to Forbes, this could soon be about to change though as they claim United 'remain interested' in the striker. It is thought this interest stems from the injury Rasmus Hojlund suffered during the pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "The report adds that United would be looking at paying approximately £40m should they wish to bring Toney to Old Trafford. With money tight though, it is unclear whether Ineos would green light this move considering he is 28.",

      "How does it feel to play for Manchester United in front of thousands of fans at just 17 years old?",
      "Just ask Harry Amass, who started against Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool on tour in the USA.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" he said. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side. You might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass spoke to Manchester-based reporters in the mixed zone in the Snapdragon Stadium last week and a start against Liverpool in Columbia followed that conversation.",
      "The youngster was asked about a potential start in the Community Shield against Manchester City and said: \"No conversations have been had yet, but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke [Shaw] and Tyrell [Malacia] come back.",
      "\"My intention is to play first-team football at this club. I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Luke Shaw started for England in the final of the European Championship against Spain and has been given an extended break, while Tyrell Malacia is still recovering from injury.",
      "Malacia last played a competitive fixture for the Netherlands in June last year and has faced a prolonged period on the sidelines due to a knee injury, which required two rounds of surgery.",
      "The 24-year-old is expected to be available again in two months, which opens the door for Amass, and the London-born full-back intends to capitalise on the opportunity.",
      "After just one year at United, Amass has already drawn comparisons to Shaw, who swapped the South for the North himself when he was a teenager. \"It is a good comparison,\" he said.",
      "\"In my opinion, [Shaw is] one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain at the comparisons!\"",
      "United thought Shaw had the quality to play at Old Trafford for 10 years when he was signed from Southampton in 2014 and they recognised similar potential in Amass when he was signed from Watford last summer, a move that was considered a coup given the interest from other clubs.",
      "Amass was persuaded to sign for United and hasn't looked back. He was tremendous for the Under-18s last season, playing a key role in a supremely talented team that won a treble, and is now on the cusp of making his senior debut after delivering mature pre-season performances.",
      "Anyone who has watched Amass will understand there can be no concerns about his ability, talent or mentality. He is a technically exceptional, modern-day full-back, but the only question mark against the youngster was whether he was physical enough for senior football.",
      "Amass is diminutive but proved himself on the pre-season tour. His 'aggression' compensates for his lack of stature and he got the better of Mohamed Salah at the weekend.",
      "Malacia won't be involved in the squad for the Community Shield against City on Saturday and Shaw won't have the fitness to play 90 minutes at Wembley.",
      "Amass is almost guaranteed to be involved in some capacity and that will highlight his impressive progress in the space of just a few months, as the youngster only got close to the pitch when he warmed up on the sidelines when he was last at Wembley for the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "Erik ten Hag named Amass, Ethan Wheatley, Habeeb Ogunneye and Louis Jackson on a handful of benches at the end of last season due to the injury crisis and any observers would have noticed how slight they looked, which is normal at their age, in the pre-match warm-ups.",
      "However, what Amass lacks in physicality, he makes up for in character, aggression and talent, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see him start against City in the Community Shield.",

      "\"Quite a few of us wanted it and we had a bit of banter about it!\" Wheatley says of the 250 milestone. He is stood with Amass and Collyer, both smiling ruefully in the Snapdragon Stadium mixed zone.",
      "Southerners Collyer and Amass are doing their utmost to extend the number to 251 as soon as possible. United expect Collyer, Amass and Wheatley to remain with the squad beyond the transfer window.",
      "Collyer, 20, has started in three of United's four pre-season games and strapped on the captain's armband for the second half against Rosenborg. The 17-year-old Amass has lined up in both tour games in the United States.",
      "Left back Amass followed up his invaluable 45 minutes against Arsenal in Los Angeles, where he was blindsided by Gabriel Jesus for the equalising goal, with a complete performance against Real Betis in San Diego. He capped it with an assist for Amad and drew approval from the crowd with his tenacious tackling.",
      "\"I enjoy it, man,\" the Londoner says. \"In front of the crowds, playing with the best players, I’m enjoying it. You’ve just got to show your aggressive side, you might be young, smaller than the opponent, but you have to show you are aggressive and don’t back down. Then you can have a good game.\"",
      "Amass only joined the United academy from Watford last year. Such was his importance during the run-in last season, Erik ten Hag checked on his well-being in the Carrington canteen when the academy squad returned from their title-clinching win at Wolves in April.",
      "Luke Shaw only played 15 times for United last term and Tyrell Malacia's absence from club football is nearing 15 months. Amass could conceivably start the Community Shield against Manchester City on Saturday.",
      "\"No conversations have been had yet,\" he admits, \"but this pre-season is a chance to prove that if I am picked I can do it. Obviously we’ll see what happens when Luke and Tyrell come back. My intention is to play first team football at this club.",
      "\"I think if the opportunity comes, I’ve got to take it with both hands, it could change my career. I am just waiting for that moment, I am ready.\"",
      "Diminutive, fleet-footed and attack-minded, there are obvious parallels with the great Barcelona and Spain left back Jordi Alba. Shaw is another Cockney left back who has settled in Manchester for a decade.",
      "Amass approves of that comparison. \"It is a good comparison. In my opinion one of the best left-backs in the Premier League, if not the best for a long time. So I am not gonna complain about the comparison!\"",
      "\"We have to make progress,\" Ten Hag said on Amass. \"But we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years, for instance two years ago, Garnacho last season. We had it during last season with Kobbie, but he (Amass) is not that far now at this moment. But if we train him well, if we coach him well, then in three months it's possible that he can be on that point.",
      "\"But in this moment he needs to catch up and he has to develop some skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league. But with big talent it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is capable of doing this.\"",
      "Collyer, signed from Brighton as an 18-year-old two years ago, trained under Ten Hag as early as September 2022. He is one of only three academy players whose contract signing Ten Hag insisted on attending. The other two were Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"I think it's a massive boost,\" Collyer says of Ten Hag's attendance for his signing ceremony. \"It shows obviously he rates me as a player. Just onwards and upwards really, just got to give my best every day and see what happens.\"",
      "Collyer came on for half-an-hour at the Snapdragon Stadium and thwarted Betis twice in injury time with valiant interventions. He has acquitted himself impressively and United need to bring down the average age of their midfield department.",
      "\"When you're on the bench I think it's really valuable just to be in and around it, experience what it's like on a matchday,\" Collyer explains. \"In the changing room, on the bench, with a crowd, getting used to it. Now I've managed to get quite a lot of minutes in pre-season, so I'm happy.",
      "\"I'd say with me, a lot of my work is off the ball as well. Predominantly, I'm a really busy player, I like to get about the pitch and an area of my game I'd like to improve on is in possession. So I think the only way you're going to get better is by demanding the ball, getting on it and not backing away from situations when you could.\"",
      "Ten Hag made a beeline for Mainoo after United's League Cup victory last year and back at Wembley 15 months later, did likewise with Collyer after United won the FA Cup. \"He just said take it all in, enjoy myself and keep working hard and you never know what can happen,\" Collyer reveals.",
      "\"He's a really good guy, the manager. With everyone, he tells you what he wants from each player, he tries his best to help you out, as well as with the other coaching staff as well.",
      "\"At the end of the day, they do everything for us and we have to put it out on the pitch and give everything for them.\"",
      "Stockport-born Wheatley was one of a handful of positives from the listless defeat to Rosenborg last month. He can expect to continue training with the first team amid Rasmus Hojlund's six-week absence with a hamstring strain.",
      "\"I'm just taking everything as it comes, to be honest,\" he cautions. \"Obviously, I had a little taste of it last season. This season, I just want to keep my head down, keep developing as a player and keep impressing, so hopefully get more chances.",
      "\"The club, its history is of bringing through loads of academy players, the likes of Kobbie, playing with us less than a year ago and breaking into the first team, inspires us and motivates us. Because we know the pathway is there. If we impress, get the chances that will be given at this club we'll take them.\"",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has not rejoined United as a striker coach but Wheatley, born in the same year that Van Nistelrooy left United, is picking his brains. \"I think especially since Ruud came in, obviously he was a top striker, he was probably one of the best strikers we've had at the club.",

      "A striker and a centre-back have arrived, while it is thought that Erik ten Hag is closing in on a new midfielder, Manuel Ugarte. While Leny Yoro’s three-month setback could push United into another centre-half signing this window, other positions may need some attention.",
      "One of those is left-back, given how injuries decimated options there last season. Luke Shaw is back to fitness but only played 15 matches last term due to issues and is yet to go through a full season at United without injury.",
      "Meanwhile, Tyrell Malacia is not expected to return until October, having not played in more than a year due to setbacks in his rehabilitation from serious surgery. Sergio Reguilon was acquired on loan last deadline day but returned to Tottenham in January after Ten Hag ended his stay early, with Shaw and Malacia both expected back soon. That never happened.",
      "As a result, Diogo Dalot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and even Victor Lindelof had to cover in the role with full-back options stretched. Sorting another loan this summer to cover for Malacia would be sensible.",
      "But meanwhile, academy recruit Harry Amass has impressed so far in pre-season, most notably against Real Betis. The 17-year-old joined from Watford last August with big hopes for the future, and the first fruits of his potential are starting to show.",
      "A few first-team stints this coming season followed by consistent progress, and United might not need to find a new left-back when Shaw’s contract runs out in 2027, saving a good few million. For now, third-choice at United is an ample status, and the reality is that the team might still need more experienced cover at left-back via a loanee until Malacia returns.",
      "Another area of debate is the right-wing position. On paper, United have a number of options there, with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford able to play in the role, Alejandro Garnacho too, albeit to limited effect.",
      "In reality, the spot has hardly been nailed down in Ten Hag’s tenure, with Antony underwhelming his £85m price tag, Rashford preferring the left flank far more, and Sancho falling out with the manager, a feud that has now been quashed.",
      "There has been good reason to suggest that the right wing needs a new addition, but United need not bother. Amad can save United a good few quid in the short term with his assets from the right, as shown against Real Betis.",
      "His breakaway goal against Liverpool in last season’s FA Cup tie showed the raw talent he has, something that former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray was never shy to underline during Amad’s 14-goal loan spell at the Black Cats two seasons ago.",
      "Amad has now scored twice in pre-season, for what that is worth. His goal against Rangers might have felt sweet given his torrid former prior loan spell in Scotland.",
      "But it was against Real Betis that he showed what he can do when he has minutes under his belt, scoring United’s second of the game after winning a penalty for their first. After recovering from a long-term injury in time for the second half of the season, Amad only managed to start the final three league games.",
      "Now 22, the attacker has the confidence and ability to show he can challenge and perhaps usurp Antony on the right for more starts. Either way, his resurgence has saved United from forking out millions for another",

      "Obi-Martin, who scored 29 goals in 17 league matches for Arsenal's Under-18s last year, went from strength to strength last season, notably scoring 10 goals in a single game against Liverpool. It's understood United's head of the academy, Nick Cox, and the head of academy recruitment, Luke Fedorenko, are the main driving forces behind the deal.",

      "Kaya Kaynak: \"It's a bit hard to say as he's still so young, but one thing he seems to be very good at is scoring goals. He's quite a bit taller than most others around his age group right now and looks stylistically a bit similar to Alexander Isak with his languid running and technical ability.\"",

      "Earps joined the Reds in 2019 and helped the club win the FA Cup last year. However, the shot-stopper opted to embark on a new chapter when her contract expired in June after a disappointing Women's Super League (WSL) campaign saw United finished fifth last term - 21 points worse off than in the previous campaign.",
      "Despite being linked with a move to Arsenal, Earps chose to join PSG, who have qualified for the Women's Champions League for six consecutive seasons. Speaking on the latest episode of the BBC's Tooney & Russo Show, Earps said she has established some \"great relationships\" in Manchester, but her decision to leave was fueled by \"the opportunity to play for a great team in top competitions\" and be \"in a position to win silverware\".",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of highly-rated Sweden international Anna Sandberg on three-year deal, with the option of a further year.",
      "The defender joins the Reds from BK Hacken, where she had been playing since July 2022, gaining Champions League experience with the Damallsvenskan side. On the international stage, Sandberg was part of the Sweden squad that finished third at the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup.",
      "She joins for what will be a record transfer fee for a Swedish women’s player, surpassing the £150,000 Everton paid to Rosengard for Hanna Bennison in 2021. The 21-year-old full-back is United's fourth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Elisabeth Terland and Melvine Malard.",
      "“I’m very happy and grateful to sign for this big club, Manchester United,\" Sandberg said. \"I hope I can help our team with my qualities and deliver many winning moments for our fantastic fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “We are delighted to have Anna join our Manchester United family. She is a talented young player, who already has a wealth of international and Champions League experience. We look forward to seeing her develop further in red.”",
      "United finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last season and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their 2024/25 campaign underway against West Ham United at Old Trafford on the weekend of September 21/22.",

      "As Manchester United set to work dismantling Tottenham Hotspur in the Women's FA Cup final, there was one player inside Wembley Stadium whose loyalties were split.",
      "Grace Clinton, who joined United from Everton in 2022, had spent the season on loan at Spurs and was therefore ineligible to feature against her parent club. Her absence was a huge blow for Robert Vilahamn's side, who ultimately fell to a 4-0 defeat in north-west London as the Reds romped to their first major piece of silverware.",
      "Clinton had been a revelation during her season-long stint at Brisbane Road, completing a clean sweep of Tottenham's Player of the Season awards and breaking into the senior Lionesses squad. \"She will be the next superstar in this country if you ask me,\" Vilahamn said after the midfielder's impressive start to life on loan. \"I think she's brilliant and has the potential to be so good.\"",
      "Clinton form was so good, in fact, that Tottenham were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "The 21-year-old - who also excelled on loan at Championship side Bristol City in 2022/23 - seemed to relish her time at Spurs, forging a close friendship with teammate Celin Bizet and flourishing under the watchful eye of Vilahamn. “Confidence for me comes from the manager, and both Robert and (England boss) Sarina (Wiegman) have given me so much of that this season,” Clinton told the MEN earlier this year.",
      "“This season I’ve just been filled with confidence and I think you can see that on the pitch. That freedom and confidence from them has allowed me to go and express myself.”",
      "This week, however, seemed to draw a definite line under Clinton's Tottenham adventure, with the midfielder taking to social media to pen an emotional farewell to the Lilywhites. \"This past year was by far my happiest season of football,\" she wrote on Instagram.",
      "\"I loved every minute at this club and I’ve made friends for life along the way. I’m so beyond grateful to the staff and my teammates for making this club so special to be a part of. Most importantly thank you to our fans for your unbelievable support this past year, you truly helped us make history and those are moments I will cherish with me.\"",
      "While part of Clinton's heart might always belong to Spurs, her focus will now turn to transforming United into a consistent force in the Women's Super League (WSL), with the former Everton prodigy set to return to Leigh Sports Village as Marc Skinner's side ramp up their pre-season preparations. Despite beating Tottenham to the FA Cup trophy last term, the Reds faltered in the top flight, finishing in fifth place and winning just 10 of their league games.",
      "In spite of United's turbulent campaign, manager Skinner was somewhat controversially awarded a one-year contract extension by the club's hierarchy and the 41-year-old will surely now be delighted to have Clinton to call upon as he bids to turn the Reds' WSL fortunes around.",
      "Though he has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester, her return will be a huge boost for Skinner, particularly considering the club have parted company with midfield duo Katie Zelem and Irene Guerrero this summer.",
      "\"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" the United boss said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "Certainly, Clinton returns to United a much more well-rounded player than when she left, having gained valuable experience on both the domestic and international stage. The midfielder won her first senior cap for the Lionesses against Austria in February and took just 19 minutes to crown her eye-catching debut with a goal.",
      "\"She plays like a natural,\" Wiegman said after the game. \"She wants to have the ball. She picks up the things we talk about very quickly and that's what you see on the pitch too. She just goes out there and plays.\"",
      "Clinton has won a further two caps over the past five months and is surely destined for many more. But it is not only on the pitch where the youngster has learnt some valuable lessons of late.",
      "“Grace is a great girl,” Manchester City and England defender Alex Greenwood told the MEN in April. “You see her about and she's always wanting to ask questions, learn from everyone, and she's a really confident girl as well. She believes in herself and she always wants to improve, and I love that about Grace.",
      "“She was doing a press conference and so she came up to me and Lucy (Bronze) and said: ‘What can’t I say?’ That’s just an innocent question and that’s not even about football but it’s stuff that comes hand-in-hand now with playing for the Lionesses.",
      "“At dinner she asks questions like ‘What do you eat Al?’ I remember her first camp, we were on a walk before the game and I said: ‘Grace, you haven’t shut up this whole walk’...but it’s nice.”",
      "While it's clear Clinton still has plenty to learn - both on and off the pitch - her return could spell very good news for United as they look to bounce back from the disappointment of last season. Her time at Spurs may have played a vital role in shaping her career to date but it is the Reds who must now help England's \"next superstar\" fulfil her true potential.",

      "City did the double over United last season, including a 3-1 win at the Theatre of Dreams in November, and finished 20 points above Skinner's side, pushing champions Chelsea all the way in the title race. The Reds, who finished in fifth place, will hope for a very different outcome next term as they seek to add more silverware to their Women's FA Cup trophy.",
      "\"It’s always such a pleasure to play at Old Trafford and the entire squad are really looking forward to returning there for our season opener against West Ham,\" said manager Skinner.",
      "“To then also be back to face Crystal Palace mid-season and then close our WSL campaign against Manchester City is really something for all our great fans to be excited for - and we cannot wait for them all to pack the stands for all three games.”",
      "United have introduced the Old Trafford Bundle - entitling fans to tickets to all three matches for a reduced price - to encourage as many people as possible to show their support for the women's team. The record attendance for a United Women's game is currently the 43,615 set in that Manchester derby defeat eight months ago.",
      "An adult match ticket bundle is priced at £30, with reduced rates for men's Season Ticket holders, juniors and United members. Fans can also purchase United Women season tickets which include entry to all games the team play, both at Leigh Sports Village and Old Trafford.",
