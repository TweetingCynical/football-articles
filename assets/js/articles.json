      "Jack Kingdon, Sam Murray and James Nolan are all set to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The trio are all out of contract this summer and will depart on frees after not being offered new terms.",
      "Kingdon, 19, was a key player in the Under-18s' treble-winning team last season and has been performing well on loan at Rochdale since joining them in the January window. It is believed that he was close to signing for Ineos-owned FC Lausanne Sport on loan in January before opting for Rochdale, who he has helped reach the National League play-offs.",
      "The centre-back, who was born in Bolton and joined United from Morecambe for a six-figure sum in November 2020, has trained with the first team at Carrington and represented Scotland at various age levels. He also spent time training with Lausanne's first team in Switzerland last year, impressing their staff.",
      "Murray, 20, came to United as a teenager from Huddersfield and played in all six games of the successful 2022 FA Youth Cup campaign, which concluded at Old Trafford. The left-back, who recently captained the Under-21s against Wolves and scored against West Ham in the PL2 play-offs on Monday, has been a steady performer in the academy.",
      "Nolan, 19, a jack-of-all-trades on the pitch, joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle in Scottish League One on loan during the summer transfer window and has since made 33 appearances. The Chorley-born player has mainly been seen holding down the fort at full-back for Caledonian Thistle.",
      "The three will be part of a huge cohort of players seeking new employers in the summer. It was reported earlier this week, that only four players are deemed as untouchable by the United hierarchy, with the club open to offers on every other player.",
      "The quartet, as reported by the Daily Star, are understood to be Harry Maguire, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Aside from those, United are open for business as they look to raise funds for a huge rebuild under Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss wants players that suit his system, but there is an understanding that outgoing business will need to be conducted first.",
      "Along with the players that can be sold for fees, four senior stars will be out of contract. Tom Heaton, Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans will all leave, while Victor Lindelof is still unsure over whether he will be offered a new deal."

      "Former Manchester United ace James Wilson has been released by Northampton Town. The 29-year-old, once touted by Louis van Gaal to have the potential to succeed Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie at Old Trafford, finds himself looking for new club after the end of the League One season.",
      "Wilson broke onto the scene by making an emphatic impact on his United debut. Playing under Ryan Giggs in the final home match of the 2013/14 season, the then 18-year-old bagged a brace to introduce himself to Red Devils fans to dramatic effect.",
      "\"You have seen a little glimpse of the future,\" Giggs told fans after the match. \"This is what this club is about. We never stand still. We give youth a chance as we try and play attractive football.\"",
      "\"He is a natural goalscorer but he has got more to his game than that,\" Giggs said of Wilson. \"He can run at people, he has got pace and he is a clever player.\"",
      "Despite earning 20 appearances in his United career, Wilson failed to make the cut with the 13-times Premier League champions. After loans Brighton, Derby and Sheffield United, a loan spell to Aberdeen became a permanent one.",
      "Following his time in Scotland, Wilson has had spells with Salford City and Port Vale. The striker then completed a move to Northampton Town ahead of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Wilson signed a one-year deal with the option of a further 12 months but failed to hit the heights for the Cobblers. The former Old Trafford prospect failed to score in 12 appearances for the club and has been released.",
      "He was one of 11 players to see their time with Northampton end. Manager Kevin Nolan reflected on the decisions as Tyler Magloire, Jack Sowerby, Nik Tzanev, Ali Koiki, Liam McCarron, Harvey Lintott, Akin Odimayo, Will Hondermarck, TJ Eyoma and Reuben Wyatt all exited after a 19th-place finish.",
      "\"We have made some difficult decisions and it is never nice having to tell a player that their contract is not being renewed,\" he said.",
      "\"Some of these players have been at the club a number of years and have played a big part here, helping the club enjoy some good times over the last few years, and all of the departing players will leave with our thanks and best wishes.",
      "\"We believe we have a good core of players here, both in terms of ability and culture, which is very important, and we are excited to be entering into discussions with our chosen targets to build on and add to that over the course of the summer.\""

Both Friday night games were initially set to take place alongside other Premier League matches on Sunday April 18.",
      "And Villa’s director of football operations Damien Vidagany outlined their unhappiness in a post on social media. “Fixture changed and, honestly, not happy,” he wrote. “We really pushed to protect our fans (our main task and duty) and keep the Spurs match on Sunday. Nothing against Spurs.",

      "\"Cleverley stabilised performances at the end of the 2023/24 season in an interim position before his full-time appointment last summer. At one stage, the Golden Boys were part of the play-off picture but, unfortunately, performances and results drifted with just five wins in 2025.\"",
      "Sporting Director Gian Luca Nani said: “We thank Tom for his service – not just in his role as Head Coach but for everything he has given Watford as a player and member of staff.",
      "“But the time has come for a change and to build on what we believe is a young and talented squad that will have benefitted from the experience of the Championship this season.",
      "“It has been a privilege to work closely with Tom; to understand how he sees the game and his enthusiasm for everything here. He deserves to be recognised for this and I’m sure he will have a bright future in the game. Tom will always be part of Watford in recognition of all that he has achieved over so many years.”",
      "Cleverley, 35, has been at Watford since 2017 after making a loan move from Everton. He made that switch permanent, eventually making just under 150 appearances for the Herfordshire outfit.",
      "He was named as interim head coach in March 2024 and was handed the permanent role after just one defeat in seven matches. He had penned a deal until the summer of 2027.",
      "Cleverely had Watford challenging for the playoff positions earlier this season but just one win in their last eight matches of the campaign saw their promotion hopes fade rapidly.",
      "Watford eventually finished 14th in the Championship, with the club's controversial owners opting for a change. The Pozzo family have made 20 managerial changes alone in the 13 years they have been at Vicarage Road, while five men have been in the dugout since the Hornets were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2021/22 season.",
      "Since their return the Championship, Watford have not finished any higher than 11th. The fixtures for the new season are set to be released 26 June 2025."

      "The Red Devils - as well as Premier League rivals Chelsea - were both linked with him but neither were able to agree a deal with Napoli. Saudi side Al-Hilal were also interested, only to see Osimhen turn down their offer.",
      "In the end, Turkish side Galatasaray sealed a surprise loan deal for his services, agreeing to pay £7.6m for the season. Osimhen has enjoyed a brilliant season in Istanbul having netted 33 goals throughout the campaign.",
      "That form has seen United and Chelsea retain their interest in the forward but it appears that they are going to be left frustrated again. According to Turkish outlet Milliyet, Galatasaray have managed to put together the £56m fee they have to pay in order to sign him permanently.",
      "Galatasaray boss Okan Buruk has also attempted to intervene, having promised Osimhen that he could stay at Galatasaray for a further season and play in the Champions League. The club would then not stand in his way if an offer to return to Europe was tabled in 2026.",
      "All that remains is for Osimhen to give his approval to a move and based on his recent comments, he would be open to staying. Speaking recently, he said: “It’s a great feeling.",
      "“It’s great that they [young fans] are inspired by watching me, that they are wearing the masks. I thank God. I hadn’t seen this much before coming to Galatasaray.",

      "Speaking about breaking his record for the most goals in one season, the striker added: “It was important to break my record in my first season. I am at one of the most important clubs in the world. The biggest club in Türkiye. I would like to thank my family and friends for helping me. I would like to thank the technical team and the club staff.",
      "“They never left me alone. This season is a memory that I will remember for the rest of my life. Apart from goals and assists, I like to help the team. I want to get the ball in the future, help the midfield, do my best for the team. The team comes first for me.",
      "“When I convert opportunities into goals, it makes me happy. The important thing is not Victor Osimhen, but the team. Roland is also very important. We can say the same thing for Mario, Torreira and Sanchez.”"

      "The Torino goalkeeper has kept 11 clean sheets for the mid-table Serie A outfit and has caught the eye of some of the Premier League's major sides, reports Tutto Mercato. The goalkeeper’s contract with Torino runs until 2026 and it includes a release clause worth €20million (£16.9m).",
      "United once had Milinkovic-Savic on their books but were unable to sort a work permit out and had to release him as a result. In May 2014, United reached an agreement to sign the goalkeeper from Vojvodina, setting them back just shy of £2million. He remained there on loan for another season but never actually made an appearance for the Red Devils.",
      "Having failed to earn a work permit to play in England Milinkovic-Savic was released in November 2015 and he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Polish club Lechia Gdansk, before later moving to Italy.",
      "The Serbian has said on his own future: “I have learned that setting goals is not a positive thing, it is better to do things with the lights off. Then in all teams there are replacements of players who are sold and bought, the important thing is to find the right players to strengthen the team.”",
      "Torino's president Urbano Cairo has spoken out and confirmed that no bid has yet been lodged: “He had a great championship and it is normal that he receives a lot of attention, but no offer has arrived yet.”",
      "Onana was signed two years ago by Erik ten Hag as David de Gea's replacement - after the club allowed him to leave at the end of his contract. The Cameroon shotstopper's ability with his feet was seen as a huge bonus, but he's made numerous mistakes that have led to goals in both his seasons in Manchester.",
      "Question marks hang over him in what is a massive summer for Ruben Amorim, who will need to be ruthless if his stint at Old Trafford is a success. The goalkeeper was recently dropped by his coach, but was quickly re-installed as the club's No 1 after less than a week.",
      "Altay Bayindir is expected to depart as he eyes more minutes to further his Turkey ambitions and a return to his homeland is on the cards. Tom Heaton - the club's third choice - has his contract expiring at the end of the season with no decision made on his future but there is an expectation that the veteran stopper could retire."

United's men are firm favourites to reach the Europa League final after taking a commanding 3-0 lead from the first leg of their semi-final tie away to Athletic Bilbao last Thursday.",

      "Manchester United flop Antony has heaped praise on Real Betis boss Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his mojo on loan in Spain. Antony, 25, continued his outstanding form for Betis on Sunday, scoring a magnificent winning goal in the 91st minute as they beat Espanyol 2-1.",
      "The crucial result moves them to within a point of fifth-placed Villarreal, who occupy the final Champions League spot in LaLiga. Antony's curling strike from outside the penalty area made it two goals in his last two appearances, having also netted in Thursday's Conference League semi-final first leg at home to Fiorentina.",
      "Antony joined Betis until the end of the season in January and has impressed so much that the Spanish side want to sign him permanently. There've even been reports that LaLiga giants Atletico Madrid have contacted United to discuss a move in the region of £34million.",
      "Goals like his strike on Sunday will do him no harm, as he looks a different player to the one who failed miserably at Old Trafford. Antony failed to live up to his £86m price tag during two-and-a-half tumultuous years at United, where he eventually found himself out of favour under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "But the Brazilian has clicked with former Manchester City boss Pellegrini, whose full support has left Antony feeling 'grateful'. \"It's very important because I've said in many interviews that I've found myself because I'm happy, things are going well,\" he told Movistar Plus post-match.",
      "\"The coach joked with me because I scored great goals with my right foot, but he asked me when I'd do it with my left foot. I gave him a hug after scoring because he's someone I care deeply about and I'm grateful for his trust.\"",
      "The winger, who now has seven goals and four assists in 20 games for Betis, also said: \"Very happy with the win, with the amazing goal at the end of the match. We knew it would be very difficult, and now we can enjoy the victory because it's very important.\"",
      "Betis chief executive Ramon Alarcon has said the club are 'cautiously optimistic' about the prospect of keeping Antony in Seville beyond the summer. Alarcon told Canal Sur: \"When we spoke about the possibility to bring Antony in January, I saw it more distant than I see now him staying.",
      "\"It's because both Manchester United and the player have seen that Real Betis is a great place for the player to develop. Right now I'm more optimistic than in January.\"",
      "The Betis CEO added: \"It's going to be difficult because he is a player owned by Manchester with financial conditions that are what they are. I am cautiously optimistic.\""

In this situation because he's sitting up I don't consider that serious and allowed the game to continue. It's probably more a foul on Wissa than the other way,\" he said.",

      "Antony and Marcus Rashford have made it clear they are ready to leave Old Trafford. Several others are on the verge of being pushed out by Amorim and United chiefs as they look to bring down their ballooning wage bill.",
      "It appears that United chiefs are ready to be even more ruthless than many expected they might be. With the Red Devils needing to sell, it has now emerged than only four players are certain to stay.",
      "That is according to the Daily Star, who report that United are willing to sell 'most members' of the current squad. The club are said to be 'desperate' to meet financial spending rules, while also being able to supply Amorim with the funds necessary to make new signings.",
      "As a result, only captain Bruno Fernandes, veteran defender Harry Maguire, young attacker Amad and January signing Patrick Dorgu are 'immune' from the fire sale. The quartet will not depart no matter the fee offered.",
      "But if the price is right, Kobbie Mainoo, Luke Shaw, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund, Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Christian Eriksen could all be sold in this summer's window.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is another that could be moved on with the report adding United would be happy to sanction a sale if their £65m valuation is met. Chelsea are one of the clubs in the running to sign the Argentine forward, but the player would need assurances from Blues boss Maresca that he is central to his plans.",
      "For now Amorim's focus is on winning the Europa League and with it securing qualification for the Champions League. He named United's youngest-ever Premier League side for the defeat to Brentford and hinted those in the academy could play a big role next season.",
      "\"It's really important. They have to understand in this season, this season is really important, and also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season, we need to change that,\" he said.",
      "\"They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United. I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"And I think we can help even more the young kids, especially Tyler [Fredricson]. He did quite well but for the third goal he needs more help from Amad. So, with these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.",
      "\"Yeah, it's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think is the best thing.\""

      "Antonio Conte has claimed that Scott McTominay didn't flourish at Manchester United like he has at Napoli because he wasn't given an appropriate role in the squad. The Scottish midfielder has made 31 appearances for the Serie A leaders this season, scoring 11 goals and assisting twice to help them make a serious push for the title.",
      "With favourable fixtures coming up for Napoli, and a potential title on the line, McTominay could become a league winner immediately after exiting the Red Devils. While the midfield maestro was a bright spark in a struggling side, he's made the next step in his career in Italy.",
      "His current manager Conte is adamant that McTominay has flourished since leaving United because of his consistency in the starting XI - and his \"main role\" within the team. Speaking ahead of the team's next clash with Lecce, the 55-year-old said: \"I think McTominay is stronger today than when he arrived from United.",
      "\"Here he has grown a lot. I think that he himself feels stronger, with more knowledge, that he is also reaching an important stage of his age to understand where to go in his career because up to now he has been in the middle.",
      "\"He has never had a main role at United that instead we have given him here, he has grown a lot by working, today he is complete. But the improvement that he has had, everyone has had, otherwise it becomes difficult to explain why today we have 74 points.\"",
      "The Carrington graduate made 255 appearances for United, scoring 29 goals and assisting eight times from a central defensive role. In his time at Old Trafford, McTominay managed to win the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, both of which came under Erik ten Hag's leadership.",
      "The former United boss previously admitted that he wasn't happy with the Scot's sale to Napoli, claiming that the midfielder was \"so important\" to the team.",
      "Before his departure, Ten Hag said: \"I am a little mixed. I am very happy for him but I would prefer not to lose him because he was so important for our team.",
      "\"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales. Obviously, homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do, but for everyone, for all parts, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it. Of course, for Napoli, a very good player, but also for us.\"",
      "United have been left to rue not finding a consistent position for McTominay like Napoli have. His irregular game time contributed to his decision to leave, and it's yet another saga that sums up the issues his former club have been blighted by."

      "Wayne Rooney has given a scathing assessment of Manchester United under Ruben Amorim after their 4-3 defeat by Brentford on Sunday. Amorim picked an inexperienced team to face the Bees and saw his side beaten for the 16th time in the Premier League this season.",
      "With Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao the clear priority, Amorim named the third youngest Premier League starting XI of any club. Youngsters Chido Obi-Martin, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson were all handed opportunities but did not impress.",
      "However, United legend Rooney was more critical of Amorim and the more experienced players who were out there. Speaking on Match of the Day 2, he called out Kobbie Mainoo for “switching off” for two of Brentford’s goals and Amorim for fielding substitute Amad Diallo out of position at right wingback and for putting a “disjointed” team together which put “no pressure on the ball” and lacked intensity.",
      "Expanding on Rooney’s points, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said: “It is about intensity, but with wingbacks, different to a back four, it allows you to go and press because you’ve got the extra centre half behind you.",
      "“But surely that’s what they do in training, no? If you’re a coach of a system – the basics of this system with wingbacks is they press the wide men quick and it doesn’t look like they’re doing it. It’s bizarre for me to see.”",
      "Rooney replied: “It’s strange, because that’s why you play a back five with wingbacks. They have to put pressure on the ball or otherwise you get outnumbered in the midfield and the ball comes back into midfield. It was strange, but they had a lot of young players.”",
      "“There was a lack of movement and a lack of knowhow on the pitch,” he added. “They’ve got a 17-year-old lad up front – the youngest ever to start up front for United – and they’re just launching balls up to him. I really felt for Obi today because you can tell he’s inexperienced but it looked like he had no help, they were just throwing balls up to him.”",
      "Murphy added: “I get that there’s young players, I understand that and they’re playing against good teams. But he (Amorim) only plays one system, he’s not mixing things up, personnel and system and he’s been there a while now. When you play a system that much and you work on it in training, surely we can see more improvement, irrelevant of who is playing because they should be organised in that system.”",
      "Rooney responded: “You’d think so, but I think the second team are playing a back four, which I found strange, because those players who are coming into the first team now with the under-23s or under-21s are playing a different system.",
      "\"For me, that’s a bit confusing. Getting to the Europa League final is papering over a lot of cracks for Manchester United and that needs solving quickly.”"

Littler added: “When Maguire scored the winner against Lyon, I put on my Instagram, 'Can you wear the No.9 shirt?' And he replied with laughing emojis.\"",
      "While Littler is a loyal United fan, it appears that he won’t be stretching his schedule to go and watch the side should they reach the Europa League final. The Red Devils are 3-0 up after the first-leg of their semi final against Athletic Bilbao.",

Speaking to SportsBoom.co.uk, he said: \"I have been looking at flights - but I'll go only if I’m allowed. Even if I don’t go, I’ll obviously watch it. I don’t think a PJ [private jet] is worth it.\"",
      "Despite that, Littler has claimed that United have already given him inspiration this season. He suggested that the side’s FA Cup defeat to Fulham earlier this term had pushed him on to reach the UK Open semi-finals.",
      "He said: \"Obviously I am happy, I'm into the final of the UK Open at my third attempt. But in the second break I heard about the Manchester United loss so it spurred me on a bit, won the next five.”"

      "He has struggled to challenge Onana, however, and has conceded four goals in three of his eight starts this season. The 27-year-old is expected to look for a move to secure first-team football this season.",
      "That could leave United on the look-out for a second-choice goalkeeper this season and potentially someone to lay down a greater challenge to Onana, so keeping Heaton around for an extra year will at least provide some continuity, with clubs keen to keep three experienced goalkeepers on their books."

      "Manchester United are reportedly preparing for another club to join the race to sign Napoli striker Victor Osimhen in the summer transfer window.",
      "Osimhen is set to be the focus of plenty of transfer attention this summer having seemed destined to leave last year only for a move to fall apart in the final stages of the window. With his options of moving to a top-five league in tatters, Galatasaray managed to capitalise by offering him a season-long escape thanks to the Turkish window closing later than the rest of Europe.",
      "Since switching to Istanbul, Osimhen has continued to hone his goal-scoring talents with 33 goals bagged in just 37 matches. Such form continues to make him a target for a number of Premier League clubs this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Chelsea have been credited with the strongest interest but MEN Sport understands that United did consider Osimhen as a player of interest during Erik ten Hag's tenure. This summer, the Reds are set to focus on their attack and Rio Ferdinand has already suggested that Osimhen is the man they should target.",
      "It has, up until now, been seen as inevitable that Osimhen will leave Galatasaray for a new club. However, Milliyet Skorer understands that the Turkish giants are not ready to let the Nigerian leave just yet.",
      "The 26-year-old is thought to have impressed the Galatasaray board so much that they are willing to sanction a 'historic' offer to try and keep him. It is reported that, as soon as he agrees to staying in Istanbul, Galatasaray would be happy to bid £56m for his services.",
      "Napoli are in a rush to sell Osimhen this summer but whether the striker would be happy to return permanently to Turkey is another matter. Galatasaray look set to qualify for the Champions League but it is unknown whether the lure of Europe's elite competition alone will be enough to get his signature.",
      "United are currently cash-strapped with the need to sell clear ahead of the summer transfer window opening. However, their finances could receive a huge boost if they win the Europa League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men are 3-0 up on aggregate against Athletic Bilbao and should they progress to the final in the Basque Country and beat either Tottenham Hotspur or Bodo/Glimt, they would qualify for next season's Champions League. If United or Spurs were to win the Europa League, a whopping six English teams would be playing in the Champions League next season."

      "Ruben Amorim had called it. \"Not the best moment\" to play the kids, he said recently. Manchester United's young guns might now also understand why their manager was cautious about chucking them in at the deep end this season.",
      "If this is a case of sink or swim, then the third youngest team in Premier League history were gasping for air at the Gtech Community Stadium. This won't be an afternoon that will wreck promising careers, but it could certainly be a setback.",
      "Tyler Fredricson had a promising start but was replaced by Victor Lindelof as he began to struggle. Chido Obi might have signed up to Rasmus Hojlund's strikers' union on his return to the away dressing rooms after this chastening effort.",
      "It's worth revisiting Amorim's comments from a couple of weeks ago about the danger of throwing the kids in during a domestic campaign that has become an embarrassment to the club.",
      "\"It's not the best moment or the best season to put some kids to play because again they need a strong base to really show what they can do, but in this moment we need to do it,\" Amorim said.",
      "You can't really argue with that, but you can also see why United's head coach was reluctant to do what he had to do at Brentford. The result was a 16th defeat of the season and another rough afternoon.",
      "Before kick-off, there had been excitement at the United line-up. At 17 years and 155 days, Obi became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United. He was the junior member of a very junior team. With an average age of 22 years and 270 days, this was the third youngest team to start a Premier League game for any club.",
      "It didn't feel like that was the case when the team dropped, but youngsters such as 20-year-olds Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho have so much first-team experience that it can be easy to forget their tender years. Six members of the starting XI were 20 or younger, with Harry Amass, Fredricson, and Patrick Dorgu rounding off that number.",
      "The focus was on Obi, however, as it always is when a prolific goalscorer at academy levels begins to try and make the ascent to first-team football. The former Arsenal youngster has already seen just how taxing that rise can be.",
      "He has 14 goals in 15 games this season at youth level, but his cameos for the first team have shown how raw he is. He had chances against Fulham in the FA Cup but has toiled without reward otherwise.",
      "Amorim's comments about this not being the right time to play youngsters had a caveat: The head coach didn't think he had any other option. Europa League progression and the catastrophic state of their Premier League season have rendered these games exercises of survival.",
      "As soon as Joshua Zirkzee's season came to a premature end last month, it was clear Obi was going to be needed. In his first start and his longest run out yet, he got an understanding of why Amorim was concerned about exposing too many youngsters. You only need to look at Hojlund's body language to see what a thankless task playing No.9 for this team can be.",
      "Obi did scrap hard against Nathan Collins, but academy level doesn't prepare you for physical battles with 6ft 4in centre-backs with years of strength training behind them. On a couple of occasions Altay Bayindir sent long balls up for Obi to try and challenge for against Collins.",
      "That is exactly the kind of pass that Andre Onana often sends Hojlund's way, and gets a volley of abuse back in return. Obi isn't going to complain just yet but he can't have appreciated it either. He battled away manfully but got little change out of the Republic of Ireland international.",
      "When Luke Shaw then sent a free-kick spinning down the left channel, the kind of aimless ball forward that tells a striker 'chase that', it was met with an exasperated wave of the arms from Ruben Amorim. Obi was never in contention to win the race for the ball.",
      "It summed up his first half that he had just eight touches, half as many as the next lowest for United, which was Garnacho with 16.",
      "One of the problems for United's striker is that you can go through long spells of not being involved in the game, so when the chance does come, you're not ready for it. Obi had half an opportunity when Christian Eriksen's cross picked him out, but he failed to connect with his header. Even had he done so, it was a difficult chance.",
      "He deserves credit for sticking at it, however. His best opportunity came in the final minute, when perseverance saw him carve out half-a-yard of space in the box, before his shot from an angle was blocked.",
      "He won't be judged on this outing. You only have to watch Hojlund play to know how difficult it is for a striker here. Of the 39 shots United had against Bournemouth and Athletic Club last week, their striker had one.",
      "Now Obi understands his plight. At most clubs, it is the goalkeepers who stick together. At this one, it's their strikers who should have each other's backs."

      "The return of Champions League football would increase United players' salaries by 25%. Casemiro's salary would rise back up to £300,000-a-week.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe named Casemiro as one of five players who are \"overpaid\" or \"not good enough\" and the club are in the process of making up to 200 more staff members redundant.",
      "Casemiro, 33, has one year left on his contract and has outlined his wish to stay at United for a fourth year. United head coach Ruben Amorim indicated recently that Casemiro had changed his mind amid his influence in the Europa League knockout stage.",
      "However, United have sought potential bidders for Casemiro over the past 12 months and they would require £15million to sell him and avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Interest from Saudi Pro League clubs last year came to nought.",
      "United want to bolster their midfield, an area where they are short of specialists. Manuel Ugarte joined from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer but it is unclear what long-term plans Amorim has for Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer has missed 29 matches through injury this season. Christian Eriksen will be released.",
      "If United do not have any European football next season then they would also require a slimmer squad. United could play as few as 40 games in 2025-26 if they are not in the Champions League.",
      "Ratcliffe would be loath to retaining the United squad's oldest outfield player and one of their highest earners when Casemiro has started only 16 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Casemiro has started in all five of United's ties and scored the opening goal in the 3-0 victory at Athletic last week. He joined United from Real Madrid for £60m, rising to £70m."

      "De Ligt asked for treatment after suffering the injury while Brentford played on and scored seconds later.",
      "\"The main consideration in this situation was, basically, my responsibility under the laws is to decide if De Ligt is seriously injured or not,\" said Taylor.",
      "\"If it's a serious injury, then it's my responsibility to stop the game at that moment.\"",
      "\"Generally, you would consider a serious injury a head injury in the main,\" Taylor continued. \"In this situation, because of him [De Ligt] sitting up and asking for treatment, I didn't consider that serious. So that's why we allowed the game to continue and the goal resulted.",
      "\"If we analyse it a little bit more, it's probably more of a foul by De Ligt on Wissa than the other way around,\" the official added. \"Particularly in the Premier League, these days, there's a greater expectation that we're letting a lot more physical contact go.\""

      "It was Trent Alexander-Arnold's good fortune that his first Premier League start was against Anthony Martial. Of the 14 times he played against Manchester United, that was easily Alexander-Arnold's most accomplished defensive performance. He was aged 18 years and three months.",
      "United were on a winning run of nine games - still their best sequence in the last 15 years - when they hosted Liverpool in January 2017. Alexander-Arnold had three career starts to his name, all in cup games.",
      "Martial lasted 65 minutes. United recovered from a goal down to draw 1-1 but their momentum had waned and they won one of their next four fixtures. Jose Mourinho was so piqued by Martial's performance he omitted him from the next two matchday squads at Stoke City and Hull City. He was only recalled against Championship relegation fodder Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup.",

      "The BBC used to air Can't Cook, Won't Cook. With Alexander-Arnold, it is a case of can't defend, won't defend. He only lost three times against United and was tantamount to their 12th man in a couple of them.",
      "Cast your mind back to United's first victory under Erik ten Hag on that balmy August evening in 2022 and Alexander-Arnold was at the scene of the crime twice. He could not be bothered to chase Anthony Elanga after his one-two with Christian Eriksen for Jadon Sancho's opening goal.",
      "Alexander-Arnold was such a liability even Martial got the better of him that time. Martial was sent on for Elanga for the second half, the first instance of Ten Hag's in-game management back when it was influential. Rashford switched from centre forward to left wing.",
      "For the second goal, Alexander-Arnold did not know whether to come or go. The indecision played Rashford onside when he was put through one-on-one by Martial.",
      "Paradoxically, Alexander-Arnold is one of the best and worst right backs United have encountered. He was involved in 7-0, 5-0, 4-0 and 3-0 drubbings in one of Liverpool's best teams. When he left Old Trafford in September, he held three fingers up to signal the final score.",
      "United have won a derisory four of their past 19 matches against Liverpool since Alexander-Arnold's full league debut at Old Trafford. Yet he was also heavily responsible for Diogo Dalot's best performance of the season at Anfield in January. Quite a few Scousers around the press box advised Alexander-Arnold to \"f**k off\" that day.",
      "Alexander-Arnold reputedly told friends he cannot remember the game. Just as well. The gulf between Liverpool and United had not been so great for decades and the game went ahead despite treacherous weather around the ground. United unexpectedly produced their best performance at Anfield for ten years and drew 2-2.",
      "The worst-kept secret is out now. After Alexander-Arnold's winner at Leicester City last month, Clinton Morrison exclaimed on BBC commentary: \"If you're leaving a football club I don't think you celebrate like that!\"",

      "He remains United’s most influential player and has worn the captain’s armband since July 2023.",

      "It’s unclear how eager Amorim’s side would be to part with the Portuguese international, who fits the profile of players being aggressively targeted by Saudi clubs.",
      "Saudi Pro League teams have focused on signing high-profile, peak-age players to raise the league’s profile – and Fernandes would be among their most ambitious moves yet.",
      "According to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, writing for GiveMeSport, the United captain has a three-year contract offer on the table from Al Hilal, who have already snapped up Neymar, Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic since the 2023 summer window.",

      "However, there are conflicting claims around a potential £60m release clause in Fernandes’ contract. While some reports suggest such a clause exists, United have been quick to ‘downplay this’, insisting no official release clause is in place.",

      "Man Utd have opened talks with Serie A side Torino over a possible move for their highly-rated goalkeeper, as the club begin exploring replacements for Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano on GiveMeSport, Man Utd have made “initial contacts” over a deal for the 6ft 8in Torino shot-stopper, who is expected to leave Italy this summer following a standout season under Paolo Vanoli. Romano wrote:",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "Milinkovic-Savic, 28, is no stranger to Old Trafford. He was originally signed by the club back in 2014, only to be released shortly after when work permit issues prevented the then-teenager from featuring in England. A decade on, United are circling once again.",
      "Utd’s goalkeeping department has become a growing concern for head coach Ruben Amorim, with Onana’s form collapsing since the Portuguese manager took over from Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "The Cameroonian started the season in strong form under Ten Hag, keeping Utd competitive through a turbulent opening two months, but has since suffered a sharp and public decline.",
      "A string of high-profile errors, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping Onana from the starting XI in recent weeks.",
      "His understudy, Altay Bayindir, has failed to convince either. The Turkish international looked uncertain when called upon, and sources indicate the 26-year-old may look to leave this summer in pursuit of more regular first-team football",
      "According to Bayindir’s agent, Utd rejected advances for the goalkeeper in the previous window, but not it seems the club may be more open to a sale this time around.",
      "As a result, Utd have accelerated their search for a new goalkeeper — a position that had initially been seen as a secondary concern this window, behind the club’s urgent need for attacking reinforcements and a midfield overhaul.",
      "Torino’s Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a credible alternative to Espanyol’s Joan Garcia, who is also being closely monitored.",
      "Garcia has impressed in La Liga and has a release clause in the £20–25 million range, but Utd would face competition from the likes of Arsenal.",
      "Milinkovic-Savic, on the other hand, is viewed as a more accessible option. He has reportedly expressed interest in returning to Manchester, and his commanding presence, leadership, and form this season have turned heads across Europe.",
      "Despite not being the highest priority on Amorim’s long summer to-do list, the goalkeeping situation remains unresolved.",
      "The decision now rests on Torino’s valuation and Utd’s willingness to act.",
      "The good thing about being the Spurs goalkeeper is that you have plenty of chance to show off. As does Ederson these days.",
      "Man Utd have made an ‘offer’ for Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak with the Red Devils looking to sell Andre Onana this summer, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is reportedly ‘open to leaving’ Man Utd in the summer transfer window and there is already one club that is in ‘major’ talks to sign him.",

      "Wayne Rooney has hailed Harry Kane as “England’s greatest striker,” backing the Bayern Munich man as the Premier League’s finest ever number nine and insisting he should still go on to break Alan Shearer’s long-standing goalscoring record if he returns to English football.",
      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",
      "But Rooney didn’t stop there, he doubled down on his belief that Kane is already the Englands best-ever frontman.",
      "“I think he’s England’s greatest striker. Just the goals he’s scored, firstly. But then you look at the games he’s played, the goals he’s scored, he’s just… You just hope. He’s probably got one tournament left in him. You hope he can push us now to that next level.”",
      "Kane’s role for England and his tendency to drop deep drew analysis, too, with Rooney acknowledging that tactical tweaks may have blunted the Three Lions’ attack in past tournaments.",
      "“In the last Euros, you had Harry coming in, you had Bellingham coming in, and they were taking up each other’s space. As a team, Harry should’ve recognised that and said, ‘No, I’m going to play up top.’ At times, you have to do that.”",

Dembele draws level with 2024 champ Gyokeres\nRooney, who scored 208 Premier League goals himself and remains Utd’s all-time top scorer, didn’t just talk about Kane. He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",
      "“You’ve lost natural number nines. I think Isak, Haaland, and Watkins, probably the three standout ones. Rashford’s doing better now, too. But beyond that? Not many.”",
      "Asked who he’d pick as a manager if he needed one striker right now, Rooney was clear. “Haaland. As good as Isak’s been, I think Haaland’s got everything. He’s not the best at heading, his timing’s a bit off, but the goals he’s scored even this season, with injuries, I’d want him.”",
      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",
      "“I always say Drogba. He could head the ball, hold it up, and he was quick, powerful. You could play off him. That’s the kind of striker I liked.”",
      "He added, “Michael Owen (Liverpool) was unplayable for a few years. Ronaldo, R9, had everything. Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Owen, Sergio Aguero, Thierry Henry… they were incredible. But Kane, for sustainability and goals scored? He’s right up there.”",

Arsenal beating PSG before losing the final in crushing fashion is fundamentally funnier, granting the more chronically online elements of the fanbase an opportunity to crow and gloat before placing them back into their comfort zone of shouting into microphones on YouTube and demanding human sacrifices be made live on an altar at the Emirates.",

      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we looked at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "There’s no Sol Campbell on here because it happened in the before-times, but here’s a list of every club’s biggest free transfer regret if that’s more your bag.",
      "",
      "10) Youri Tielemans (Leicester City to Aston Villa)\n“From the first day I set foot on this ground, your warmth and passion embraced me. Victory and triumph, love, hope and even defeat,” wrote the Belgian midfielder as he confirmed what we had all long knew: He would leave a relegated Leicester City with an FA Cup winner’s medal and the knowledge that he could have done little more to stop the slide from two consecutive top-five finishes to relegation.",
      "In truth, his final year at Leicester was poor after a failed transfer to Arsenal left him ‘mentally gone’. We expected Arsenal to return when he became available on a free transfer in 2023 – it really did feel like a no-brainer – but it was Aston Villa who won that particular race. “The manager was selling me this idea of playing Champions League and I really bought into it,” said Tielemans, who would be playing in Europe’s elite competition a year later.",
      "After a tricky first season in Villa colours, he has since thrived in the Champions League and Premier League, where he has made a good case for making the Premier League XI of the season.",
      "READ: Alexander-Arnold joins list of every Premier League club’s biggest free transfer exit",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (Manchester United to PSG)\nThe Spanish midfielder was reduced to tears on a Manchester United podcast when discussing his exit from the club: “I got the Player of the Year award by the fans and the club didn’t call me that summer to sign a new contract, and they did with other players. That was painful for me, honestly.”",
      "Herrera won the individual gong on the back of United’s most successful post-Sir Alex Ferguson season, in which he played a key role in their League Cup and Europa League titles, and memorably man-marked Eden Hazard out of a clash with Chelsea in perhaps the defining game of his United career.",
      "But the new contract did not arrive that summer and a lame offer as his deal came to a close was comfortably improved by PSG. “There is red in my heart,” said Herrera as he confirmed his departure.",
      "He ranks pretty high in a (largely awful) list of Manchester United transfers post-Fergie.",
      "",
      "8) Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City to…)\n“I don’t know about the future unfortunately. I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don’t do what I do these last four or five weeks,” said Kevin De Bruyne after striking the only goal as Manchester City beat Wolves, taking him to 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola.",
      "He has won six Premier Leagues, one Champions League and seven domestic cups (an eighth could come in the FA Cup this month) for City, making him one of the most decorated players in Premier League history.",
      "The Belgian is clearly very upset not to be offered terms by City, meaning his 10-year reign as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history is coming to an end. Or is it? His form in the final weeks of his City stay has prompted some cheeky links with Liverpool, while Aston Villa are said to be very interested.",
      "“Let’s talk about the statue – for me he is Manchester City’s greatest ever player,” said Jamie Carragher. Would the club still build him a statue if he stays in the Premier League? They would probably quite like him to slink over to the semi-retirement of MLS.",
      "",
      "7) Gini Wijnaldum (Liverpool to PSG)\n“What this person – this wonderful, joyful, selfless person – has done for our team and club I cannot sum up in words, in truth, because my English is not good enough,” said Jurgen Klopp as Wijnaldum played his 237th and final game for Liverpool.",
      "The Dutchman had barely stopped running in five years at Anfield which earned him Premier League and Champions League medals, but he fell victim of FSG’s reluctance to hand long contracts to players in their 30s. He wanted to stay and Klopp wanted to keep him – he was ‘perfect’ for Klopp’s system – but a business decision was made.",
      "It seemed that Barcelona would sign Wijnaldum – they are masters of the free transfer swoop – but PSG stepped in to offer twice the money. There he won a French league title but being wonderful, joyful and selfless buttered no parsnips in Paris and he is now in Saudi Arabia playing as a striker.",
      "",
      "6) Emre Can (Liverpool to Juventus)\nIt’s been seven years since we said the free transfer exit of Emre Can from Liverpool should be met with ‘shrugs’, and we were absolutely right. As galling as it always is to allow a player worth £30m-plus to leave for nothing, he was never integral to a Liverpool side building towards Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It helps of course that he was then pretty poor at Juventus (though his career has since been rescued by Borussia Dortmund) while Liverpool brought in Fabinho and immediately won the Champions League. Can was never missed.",
      "",
      "5) Andreas Christensen (Chelsea to Barcelona)\n“Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,” said the Dane, not so fondly remembered by Chelsea fans after he made himself unavailable to play in the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2022. The decision to leave had clearly affected the form of a player who had won the Champions League the year before.",
      "There was enmity between club and player at the end, with Christensen blamed for twice reportedly reneging on verbal agreements to sign a new contract. He then engaged new agents who wanted to start the whole process again from scratch.",
      "He won the title with Barcelona in his very first season but has been perpetually linked with a return to the Premier League, with the Spanish club likely to accept slightly less than his £430m buy-out clause.",
      "",
      "4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea to Real Madrid)\nIn the same summer that Christensen left, Rudiger also departed Chelsea. And the Blues have been struggling for leadership at the back ever since; they have won nothing since the German left in 2021.",
      "Rudiger admitted that the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea’s ownership and the knock-on effect on player negotiations were a big factor in his exit, saying: “For me, there was a gap between August and January, and that made me think “what’s going on”.",
      "“You get pressure from other teams because it’s January and people don’t know what’s happening and you would have to wait until June because you have a contender to take over the club but even today you cannot talk to him because you have to go through Government stuff and everything.",
      "“I didn’t want to wait until June to sort out my future because it’s been almost a year of uncertainty.”",
      "And nobody can begrudge anybody joining Real Madrid, right?",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal to Juventus)\n“It all happened…I agreed to a contract they proposed,” said Ramsey when attempting to explain why he had left Arsenal after 11 years at the club. He claims that the offer was then retracted as manager Unai Emery decided he wanted to take the club in a different direction.",
      "A few months later Emery was sacked by Arsenal and Ramsey has signed a deal with Juventus that gave him the highest basic salary of any British footballer. But there were few regrets from Arsenal as he never started more than 13 Serie A games in a season for the Italian giants (though he did win a Serie A title) before a loan spell at Rangers and a permanent exit to Nice and then Cardiff.",
      "",
      "2) Paul Pogba (Manchester United to Juventus)\nOnly Manchester United could twice spend money on a mercurial talent and twice watch him walk away for nothing.",
      "‘For a boy that joined the academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated,’ said Manchester United in a statement that somehow missed out the details of Pogba being allowed to walk away for nothing, re-join for £89m and then leave for nothing again six years later.",
      "Relations between Pogba and the club had long since broken down but the second that Jose Mourinho referred to Pogba as a “virus” should have been the second they began plans to sell him and recoup some of their costs.",
      "He later said that he wanted to leave in the summer of 2019 after his best season for Manchester United because he saw the writing on the wall about the direction of travel but the club denied him an exit; they would live to regret their reticence.",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to, we presume, Real Madrid)\nOnly perhaps Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi have been more valuable free transfers. He has chosen adventure over comfort after winning everything at Liverpool.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly looking to get Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his Liverpool contract early in order for him to play at the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "Some Liverpool fans are absolutely seething about Trent leaving; others are embarrassed by that small-time reaction.",
      "Jamie Carragher thinks Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move from Liverpool to Real Madrid will spark ‘simmering resentment’ from fans.",
      "Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to complete a move to Real Madrid in the summer on a free transfer, according to widespread reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly attempting to persuade Barcelona to do business for Jules Kounde in the summer as they look to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is leaving Anfield because of the one thing the Reds can’t give him over Real Madrid, according to reports."

When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.3% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.6\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "10) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.9\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "13) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.8\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "14) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have had a miserable season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 15th heading into the final three matches of the campaign.",
      "Amorim’s men are already guaranteed to finish the season as the worst Man Utd team to have played in the Premier League, even if they win their remaining three fixtures.",
      "One of their main issues this season has been scoring goals with just five Premier League sides scoring fewer than them this term.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have come in for lots of criticism this season with the duo only scoring seven Premier League goals between them this term.",
      "Amorim has struggled to get the best out of his group with the Man Utd squad struggling to adapt to his style of play, formation and philosophy.",
      "And now Man Utd want to support him in the transfer window with a number of signings and one of the main areas they want to improve is in attack.",
      "On Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Brentford winger Mbeumo is now a ‘target’ for Man Utd ‘as well as’ Wolves Cunha as they look to overhaul their front line.",
      "The Brentford man is ‘high on list of potential targets as Amorim looks to bolster squad’ and Man Utd are ‘ready to join the race’ for Mbeumo ‘when competition for the £60 million-rated Brentford forward intensifies during the summer transfer window’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Wolves striker Matheus Cunha, who has a £65 million buyout clause, is a target for United in the summer but has been most effective through the middle as a No 9.",
      "‘Interest in Mbeumo is independent of the Cunha deal, with the former Troyes forward regarded as one of the best wide forwards in the Premier League.’",
      "But transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is less sure of how serious the Red Devils’ interest in Mbeumo is with “many clubs” looking to tie up a deal to sign the Brentford forward in the summer transfer window.",
      "Romano wrote in his GiveMeSport newsletter: “As far as I know, the main target remains Cunha. For Mbeumo there will be many clubs involved, so it’s an open race.”",
      "Brentford boss Thomas Frank recently admitted that Brentford are a “selling club” but that he wants to keep Mbeumo and his other top stars “forever”.",
      "Frank said: “I’m the head coach, I want my best players to stay forever. I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he’s thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don’t know. I’ve said many times: we are a selling club.",
      "“But at the same time we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world who aren’t selling clubs. So, of course, if the right price – and that’s going to be expensive – is coming, then I’m sure the club will be open for it. But I’m very happy he’s here, and I’m convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.”",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle have been given fresh hope in their pursuit of a ‘£50million’ rated Premier League forward, with the selling club open to bids.",
      "Super agent Jorge Mendes could complicate Manchester United’s summer move for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha, according to reports.",
      "The amount of money it would take for Man Utd to buy Wolves forward Matheus Cunha “could be an issue” ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Paul Scholes has two concerns over the imminent Man Utd signing and claims nothing can save what has been a “disaster” of a season for the club.",
      "Even Matheus Cunha can’t flop at Manchester United… right? He is ridiculously good and Wolves have won six in a row. It’s F365’s 3pm Blackout…",
      "Ruben Amorim hinted that Man Utd are ready to move early in the transfer window, insisting players want to come as he addressed links to Matheus Cunha."

      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano revealed that Nkunku was a genuine candidate to leave in January.",
      "However, a move never came close due to Chelsea’s reluctance to accept a loan and the player’s preference for a permanent deal.",
      "“There was a possibility for Christopher Nkunku to go on a permanent transfer in January,” Romano said. “Then all the approaches were for a loan deal, and Nkunku was not keen for a loan. Same for the club.”",
      "Romano also revealed that Man Utd, managed by Ruben Amorim, explored a potential swap deal during the winter window, but talks never progressed.",
      "“There was some interest from Bayern in January, some interest also from Manchester United, but only in case of a swap deal, and nothing happened,” he said.",
      "With Chelsea now under Enzo Maresca and preparing for another summer overhaul, Romano believes there’s now a clear path for Nkunku to depart.",
      "Surprise reports linking him with a move to champions Liverpool emerged last week.",
      "“The story for Christopher Nkunku will be different [this summer]… the clear feeling of all parties involved is for Christopher Nkunku to leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window,” he said.",
      "Nkunku, who joined from RB Leipzig in 2023 for over £50m, has struggled to find form or fitness since arriving in West London. Having missed large chunks of his first season at the club, the Frenchman has struggled to find regular minutes this term, scoring just three goals in 27 Premier League appearances.",

      "“Nkunku is not finding the space he wants,” Romano explained.",
      "“Also, probably in terms of skills, Nkunku is not exactly the kind of player needed for Enzo Maresca’s vision and idea. Nkunku wants to play on a regular basis, and at Chelsea, this is not happening.",
      "“Apart from the Conference League. But it’s about Premier League football, the crucial games, and Nkunku wants to play.”",
      "Romano also confirmed Nkunku has picked up yet another injury and will miss the next 10 to 15 days, further fuelling expectations of a summer exit.",
      "“My expectation is not to see Christopher Nkunku in a Chelsea shirt next season.",
      "“I told you that in March and in April, and I confirm that also now in May.”",
      "Chelsea are understood to be open to offers and would prefer a permanent transfer over another season of uncertainty. Clubs in Germany, Italy and Spain are also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "It remains to be seen if Utd are open to returning for Nkunku when the window opens on June 1, but their January preference for a swap deal hints at the financial restrictions the club may have to work around.",

      "5) Frank Anguissa (Napoli)\nHaving been a regular for Napoli in the two seasons since he joined, Anguissa might expect his terms to be extended. But it also might depend on the mood of Antonio Conte on any given day. Both Manchester City and United have been linked.",

      "Ramsey leaving was disappointing but nobody could blame him; the wages Juventus offered him were extraordinary and only a fool would have said no, especially taking into account it is a huge European club he was joining. It’s a shame it didn’t work a hero in two FA Cup finals.",

      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur playmaker had to leave Serie A after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and Brentford offered him a return to the Premier League, which was perfect in every way. The large Danish contingent would have helped Eriksen settle back into a competitive setting and the Bees were nowhere near bad enough for Eriksen to snub them and not good enough for there to be any chance of making him look out of his depth.",
      "Despite wanting to keep him beyond the six-month contract he signed in January 2022, Brentford could not convince Eriksen to sign and the midfielder went to Manchester United.",

      "Albion were a tricky one but we are pretty content with Izquierdo’s inclusion. What a throwback that is, by the way.",

      "After years of transfer stories linking him with a move to Arsenal, Zaha could not shine in Turkey and was loaned out to French side Lyon after a season. That did not go to plan either and he is now playing under Dean Smith for Charlotte FC in MLS.",

      "Fulham: Tosin Adarabioyo\nFulham screwed the pooch by letting Moussa Dembele join Celtic but that is more of a regret than a big transfer. Tosin Adarabioyo left the Cottagers for west London rivals Chelsea last summer in his prime years. It was gutting for Marco Silva but they have done just fine with Joachim Andersen returning as his replacement.",

As a result, we have copped out and picked the player with the highest market value on Transfermarkt to leave the Tractor Boys for nothing. That man is Sylvain Legwinski, who departed after the 2007/08 campaign and did not find a club until the following April before spending a few months at St. Neots Town.",

      "Manchester City: Ilkay Gundogan\nApologies for snubbing Sergio Aguero and Pep Guardiola’s ‘we cannoh replace him’ crocodile tears, but Gundogan is an easy choice. Alongside Erling Haaland, he was probably City’s most important player in their Treble-winning 2022/23 campaign, with his last job as City captain being to lift the Champions League trophy.",

      "Pogba’s time at Manchester United was riddled with discourse. On His Day, he was a world beater. Unfortunately for the Red Devils, he was pretty much only ever On His Day for France.",
      "The best part of it all is obviously that Man United let Pogba join Juventus for nothing in 2012, re-signed him for a world-record £89million four years later, then let him join Juventus for nothing AGAIN in 2022.",

      "It’s lovely to see Shaw back to full fitness and just as Chelsea have done successfully (touch wood) with Reece James, the Red Devils will have to manage his fitness very carefully. Ruben Amorim rotated heavily – as expected – for their inconvenient Premier League match sandwiched between their Europa League semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao and that gave Shaw the opportunity to make his second league start in a row.",

      "No team has accrued more points nor scored more goals against the top seven than Bournemouth – and that includes those sides within it. Their return from games against the teams directly below them have ultimately undermined any Champions League push; both Brentford and Brighton doing the double over them was sub-optimal. But European qualification has been made possible by how effective they have become against the division’s best.",

      "The feeling persists that Iraola might not be able to replicate this success on the shakier foundations which come higher up the ladder with less time and patience, but it remains an entirely tantalising prospect we must one day witness.",
      "It is impressive how the Spaniard seems able to contort himself into fitting numerous different job specifications.

Brentford brought Kayode in on loan from Fiorentina in January and have a £14m option to make the deal permanent, which they would be foolish not to execute. It is already difficult to think of many better signings this season.",
      "After an inevitably slow integration, the Italy youth international has found his stride. Three Premier League starts have coincided with Brentford’s first run of three consecutive Premier League wins of the season and his stated aim of “helping them reach European competitions next season” is alive.",
      "It was Kayode ugly for Manchester United but beautiful to watch a 20-year-old acclimatise so seamlessly to the league, setting up Yoane Wissa’s goal, misplacing one pass and completing more than twice as many dribbles as any other player at the Gtech.",
      "Brentford have muddled through without a proper right-back for long enough. From this brief sample, Kayode has been entirely worth the wait.",

      "Their slump across December, January and February could yet prove catastrophic to those hopes, and it will require a slip or two from some of those above, but Villa are in as good form as anyone and primed to capitalise if an opening presents itself.",
      "If only Ollie Watkins started to turn up.",
      "",
      "Manchester City’s old guard\nIt has been difficult to separate baby from bathwater when examining what should be thrown out at Manchester City this season, but this surge to their longest winning run of the campaign to cap what might be an outwardly respectable second-placed Premier League finish with an FA Cup winner’s medal does suggest that an element of restraint is necessary.",
      "Kevin de Bruyne bowing out from the club with a fine impression of his former unparalleled self should not shake the foundations of what is the fair decision to allow his contract to expire. This form and fitness might be sustainable and a post-Etihad career flourish could make Manchester City look foolish. But it is not a gamble even the impossibly rich should overthink if there is to be any sort of emphasis on building for the future.",
      "His final gift has been to hold Manchester City’s hand into the Champions League after this campaign’s substantial scare, simultaneously displaying himself in the shop window for those interested in parting with a ludicrous signing-on fee and wage.",
      "Bernardo Silva said that “a little bit of the soul of this team is going” with De Bruyne and it reinforces the belief that despite the Portuguese’s own personal struggles, he should be persuaded to stay for yet another year before his own deal expires in 2026. Pep Guardiola would surely prefer not to lose the two most-used players in his entire managerial career over the course of one summer, with decisions to come soon enough on Ilkay Gundogan and Mateo Kovacic too.",
      "The manager recently admitted his reluctance to use the club’s inexperienced academy graduates in this season’s more difficult moments was a mistake. A happy medium can be found, like Nico O’Reilly further embedding himself in a side anchored by that spine containing four 30-something midfield pass masters who have helped Manchester City rediscover their identity before they make necessary moves to update and improve it.",

      "Julio Enciso\nThe Liam Delap auction will be biblical but a temporary teammate might have used a short-term loan to attract as much attention. Kieran McKenna “would have loved to have had him a little bit earlier” and Brighton will be prepared to field intense interest in Enciso.",
      "Almost 300 players have played 1,000 minutes in the Premier League this season and Enciso ranks first of those for shots per 90 (4.12). Those numbers are skewed only slightly by a productive first half of the season at Brighton; the Paraguayan’s shots per 90 for Ipswich sandwich him between Mo Salah and Alexander Isak as an outlier among the league’s biggest strugglers.",
      "It would be no surprise to see Ipswich and McKenna learn from this season’s harsh lessons to return to this level soon; far more shocking would be if Enciso isn’t back immediately, shooting from ridiculous positions and earning weirdly respectful handshakes from a beaten Jordan Pickford.",
      "",
      "Newcastle had made a decent fist of that balance by simply winning 20 of their last 26 matches and losing the rest. That all-or-nothing approach ended their trophy drought and made Champions League qualification a live possibility.",
      "Only 11 teams in Premier League history had ever gone longer without a draw than Newcastle, who finally made sure they followed their manager’s advice and didn’t lose on one of the increasingly rare occasions when victory was not possible.",
      "A first draw for five months in any competition could be crucial, keeping the Magpies above Chelsea and Nottingham Forest regardless of their results in this tireless race. Avoiding a ruinous seasonal hat-trick of losses in the Yankuba Minteh/Dan Burn/James Milner/Chris Wood/Aaron Hughes/Tim Krul/Dan Ashworth derby was just a welcome bonus.",

Bournemouth are as similar a Premier League team to PSG as Arsenal could wish to play, uber-aggressive in the press with numerous different ways of hurting an opponent. But equally Mikel Arteta might have preferred to face any other side in between those semi-final legs.",
      "The idea was sound enough, going basically full-strength to build momentum, rhythm and confidence. The potentially season-shattering risk of an avoidable, belief-shattering defeat to an excellent side was the trade-off and while PSG themselves were beaten at the weekend by Strasbourg, they made ten changes to the starting XI which conquered the Emirates and will be fresh at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Arteta can only try to harness this and it might be that the “rage, anger, frustration and a bad feeling in the tummy” is actually what Arsenal need to pull them through and into the Champions League final.",
      "Yet the Gunners have not looked so vulnerable in as many different areas in some time, from set-piece defending to lead-squandering.",
      "The very real and very funny prospect of Arsenal failing to qualify for the Champions League while Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle, Chelsea and one of Manchester United or Spurs all win a trophy and reach the European Promised Land is on, and it starts with Nottingham Forest beating Crystal Palace on Monday night.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva seethed at Aston Villa’s time-wasting and an apparent refereeing conspiracy to undermine Fulham’s excellence by booking both himself and five of his players. But the fizzling out of what was almost an incredible season has been down to the fundamental flaws in his approach more than anything.",
      "It is a perfect summary of the fine margins Silva relies on that Fulham have had 18 games decided either way by a single goal in the Premier League this season, and they have won nine and lost nine of them. While it guarantees safety – which is an achievement a recently promoted club should not take for granted – it also places a ceiling on what Fulham can do. It inhibits them as much as it enhances them.",
      "That is why Fulham’s longest winning run matches their worst losing streak of two games, why they have had consecutive Premier League victories only once since November, why they can beat the distant champions and by far worst team in the division in between four defeats to clubs in the Premier League’s hard-boiled centre.",
      "It is also quite weird that Fulham have now ended two games this season with ten men despite not having someone sent off, with an injury suffered after all their substitutes were made. Not sure Emi Martinez can be blamed for that.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nRuben Amorim cannot specifically be faulted for honouring the established trope of Premier League teams chucking out the kids to prepare for big European games.",
      "But the idea that Manchester United can actively sacrifice their Premier League season without severe censure feels doubly cowardly. It’s as if they think them giving up on it meaning anything in a material sense pre-emptively counteracts criticism or scrutiny. And when ruthless redundancies are being made, the haemorrhaging of potential prize money is an absolutely atrocious look.",
      "In any event, a ludicrously expensive squad and coach should be able to hold their own and at the very least have an identifiable style, no matter how many changes are wrought. Never allow Manchester United being this abysmal to be normalised, accepted or forgotten.",
      "",
      "Everton\nIf you don’t love David Moyes at his nine-game unbeaten streak, you don’t deserve him at his run of one win in ten games which has neatly overlapped.",
      "It does feel as though the second wedding’s honeymoon is over, that the bloom is off the rose somewhat and Everton have slipped back into their worst habits. And when their worst habits were established at the start of the season as proving 2-0 to indeed be the most dangerous lead, that isn’t ideal.",
      "Their relative ease in sweeping into a two-goal lead over Ipswich underlined how much better than the bottom three they are, but the implosion to hand Ipswich their first points from a losing position since November emphasised the work that needs to be done to steer Everton in the right direction next season.",
      "Moyes has earned the opportunity to oversee these steps into a brave new era but he will know that performance and more generally the last few weeks have not really been good enough.",
      "Sean Dyche was sacked for a run of two wins, seven draws and four defeats; Moyes is currently on two wins, seven draws and three defeats and saying “we controlled the game” after being outshot eight to 12 at home to a relegated team sounds eerily like his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Southampton\nAfter all that it really could come down to goal difference. Southampton (-57) have some wiggle room over Derby 2007/08 (-69) but Manchester City, Arsenal and Everton’s final game at Goodison Park keeps the drama alive heading into the final weeks.",
      "One record will almost certainly fall. Four sides share the honour of having lost 29 games in a Premier League season. Southampton are on 28 and have just had the league double done over them by the next-worst team. It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "Liverpool when crowned champions\nLiverpool have played eight games as newly-crowned Premier League champions in 2019/20 and 2024/25 and they should be ashamed by a cigar-puffing, beach-dwelling, slipper-wearing record of W4 D1 L3 F16 A15.",

      "Ruben Amorim named the youngest Manchester United starting XI in Premier League history to prepare for a crucial European game. How mid-2000s of him.",
      "",
      "Sixth youngest – Manchester United 3 Leeds 0 (October 2000)\nDavid O’Leary had a decent if drearily modern reason for naming a Leeds starting XI with an average age of just 22 years and 341 days against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October 2000.",
      "Leeds would ordinarily be entirely reluctant to sacrifice a game of such magnitude against a bitter rival, but finding it sandwiched between Champions League first group stage games against Besiktas in Turkey and at home Barcelona three days either side, it was deemed necessary.",
      "Manchester United fully punished that insolence with a comfortable enough win at Old Trafford which featured an own goal from 20-year-old Matt Jones. But Leeds will not have regretted their decision as two draws in Europe helped them reach the second group stage, from which they would also advance before a valiant fall in the semi-finals.",
      "They even qualified for Europe again the next season – albeit the UEFA Cup – by finishing fourth in the league.",
      "Starting XI: Paul Robinson; Gary Kelly, Jonathan Woodgate, Danny Hay, Dominic Matteo; Matt Jones, Jacob Burns, Lee Bowyer, Stephen McPhail; Alan Smith, Mark Viduka.",
      "",
      "Fifth youngest – Sunderland v Arsenal (May 2008)\nAt 31 years old, Gilberto Silva must have felt like the designated driver when Arsenal travelled to the Stadium of Light for the final day of the 2007/08 season. The closest to the Brazilian in terms of age in Arsene Wenger’s starting line-up, which had an average age of 22 years and 315 days, was 24-year-old Emmanuel Eboue.",
      "The bench featured one 20-year-old, two aged 18 and two aged 17, and 19-year-old Theo Walcott scored the only goal of the game.",
      "As an aside, of the 11 youngest starting XIs in Premier League history, Arsene Wenger and Arsenal account for four. No other manager has named more than one, and Manchester United and Everton are the only other clubs to account for as many as two. There wasn’t even a specific reason for him to name such a young side for this match; he just did it for the love of the game.",
      "Starting XI: Lukasz Fabianski; Emmanuel Eboue, Johan Djourou, Philippe Senderos, Gael Clichy; Theo Walcott, Gilberto Silva, Alex Song, Denilson; Nicklas Bendtner, Emmanuel Adebayor.",

      "Fourth youngest – Manchester United 2 Crystal Palace 0 (May 2017)\nJoel Pereira (20), Demetri Mitchell (20), Scott McTominay (20) and goalscorer Josh Harrop (21) all made their first-team debuts against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on the final day of the 2016/17 Premier League season. Axel Tuanzebe (19) and Timothy Fosu-Mensah (19) also started as Jose Mourinho showed his faith in the kids by naming a starting XI with an average age of just 22 years and 284 days.",
      "Harrop scored and Angel Gomes came on as a late substitute to become the youngest player in Manchester United’s Premier League history.",
      "There was, of course, an ulterior motive. Wayne Rooney, at 31, was the babysitter as United cruised to a 2-0 victory, with the Europa League final just three days later. A few of the more experienced players were called upon to conquer Ajax as “humble” Jose schooled those “poets”.",
      "Starting XI: Joel Pereira; Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Demetri Mitchell; Josh Harrop, Axel Tuanzebe, Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Jesse Lingard; Wayne Rooney.",
      "",
      "Third youngest – Brentford 4 Manchester United 3 (May 2025)\nEight years has passed since a Manchester United side suffering a deeply regrettable Premier League season cast it to one side completely to focus on an unlikely surge to Europa League glory.",
      "History has repeated itself under Ruben Amorim, but it should be pointed out that an embarrassing Premier League campaign for Manchester United was once considered to be finishing 6th and not particularly far from the Champions League places, rather than scrapping with Wolves and Spurs to see who can come 13th or 14th rather than 15th.",
      "The Portuguese was justified in rotating between Europa League semi-final first legs, particularly after the accomplished vanquishing of Athletic Bilbao in Spain. But Matthijs de Ligt suffering an early injury was a setback and Alejandro Garnacho and Amad, the forwards aged 20 and 22 often tasked with carrying the team in an attacking sense, needing to claw back some dignity, pride and momentum even still in defeat was not ideal preparation.",
      "Brentford beat a side which started with an average age of 22 years and 270 days, and there is every chance that bar is lowered in the build-up to a Europa final.",
      "Starting XI: Altay Bayindir; Tyler Fredricson, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw; Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Amass; Mason Mount, Alejandro Garnacho; Chido Obi.",
      "",
      "Second youngest – Portsmouth 0 Arsenal 3 (May 2009)\nJust as Wenger used the final throes of the Premier League season to give the youngsters an extended chance in the previous season, the Frenchman named the second youngest starting XI in the competition’s history exactly 12 months later.",
      "Few would have seen Andrey Arshavin’s pre-pubescent looks and expected him to be the oldest member of this starting XI, whose average age was 22 years and 237 days.",
      "Nicklas Bendtner, then just 21, struck twice against Portsmouth at Fratton Park, while a 20-year-old Carlos Vela also found a way past David James. At 38, the former England international was over double the age of 18-year-old Aaron Ramsey.",
      "Seven of the players named in that callow starting line-up against Sunderland in May 2008 popped up against to beat Portsmouth in May 2009, although this time it was at least to help get ready to be beaten by Manchester United in a Champions League semi-final second leg at the Emirates.",
      "Starting XI: Lukasz Fabianksi; Bacary Sagna, Johan Djourou, Emmanuel Eboue; Alex Song, Denilson, Aaron Ramsey; Andrey Arshavin, Carlos Vela, Theo Walcott; Nicklas Bendtner.",
      "",
      "Youngest – Fulham 1 Middlesbrough 0 (May 2006)\nLet it never be forgotten that Mourinho was just copying Steve McClaren. The Portuguese named a weakened starting XI in preparation for an upcoming secondary European final more than a decade after the Eredivisie’s finest ever coach established the trick.",
      "If Mourinho inevitably thought that the Premier League held his United side back in terms of their Europa League arrangements, he should have tried walking a day in Shteve’s shoes.",
      "United played six games in 21 days leading up to their date with Ajax; Boro faced seven in 21 ahead of their clash with Sevilla. Both teams played 64 games throughout the whole season, and McClaren spent £9.3million, not £150m, the previous summer.",
      "Boro also had three games in between their final Premier League game and the UEFA Cup final, and McClaren chose to name a starting XI with an average age of 20 years and 181 days against Fulham. Seven teenagers were joined by a 20-year-old Danny Graham, two 21 year olds, and a 27-year-old Malcolm Christie.",
      "Second-half substitute Colin Cooper, then 39, was more than twice as old as seven starters.",
      "“It was a historic day for the club. The performance by the young players was incredible,” said McClaren, managing his final domestic Boro game after confirmation arrived earlier in the week that he was to be appointed Sven Goran-Eriksson’s replacement as England coach. That call-up for 39-year-old Colin Cooper, then 39 and more than twice as old as seven starters, never did materialise before retirement.",
      "Starting XI: Ross Turnbull; Andrew Davies, Matthew Bates, David Wheater, Andrew Taylor; Adam Johnson, Lee Cattermole, James Morrison, Jason Kennedy; Malcolm Christie, Danny Graham.",

      "Man Utd are closing in on their first summer departure with Atletico Madrid ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing six goals and two assists in 19 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Atletico Madrid are ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony with the Spanish understood to have ‘submitted a €40 million offer to Manchester United to secure his services.’",
      "Real Betis ‘hoped to negotiate a permanent purchase at the end of the season’ but rivals Atletico Madrid ‘has preemptively made a compelling offer that has convinced United’.",
      "Atletico have been ‘monitoring the Brazilian player’s progress for weeks’ and manager Diego Simeone is ‘convinced that Antony can provide the speed and directness his team needs to make a competitive leap forward in both LaLiga and the Champions League’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 40 million euro offer from the Red and Whites, presented in the last few hours, has been welcomed by Manchester United, who are willing to part with the player for a sum that allows them to recoup part of the initial investment made when they signed him from Ajax. The deal, in financial terms, is very close to being finalized, and talks are expected to progress rapidly in the coming weeks.’",
      "Real Betis are ‘unable to compete financially with Atletico’s financial muscle’ and the Verdiblancos had hoped their ‘good relationship with the player and with the United team could facilitate a more affordable negotiation’.",
      "And now it looks likely that Atletico Madrid will complete a ‘luxury addition’ for next season and the potential signing of Antony ‘could be one of the first major moves of what promises to be a busy summer at the Metropolitano headquarters’.",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is eyeing two Real Betis players as the Red Devils ‘propose a swap deal’ in a £25.5m ‘discount’ for Antony.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to include a Real Betis player in any deal they strike for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd plan on spending the money they receive from Atletico Madrid for Antony on Borussia Dortmund star Jamie Gittens, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘received’ a huge offer to sell Brazil international Antony with his form for Real Betis ‘not going unnoticed’.",
      "Arsenal are hopeful that they can get a deal for Man Utd flop Antony wrapped up ‘as soon as possible’, according to reports."

      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Monday 5 May 2025 12:52, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are not ready to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League next season.",
      "United racked up their 16th defeat of the league season, their most for 35 years, with the 4-3 loss at European hopefuls Brentford, a result that mathematically consigns them to a bottom-half finish.",
      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",
      "Brentford:  Flekken (6), Kayode (8), Collins (6), Van den Berg (6), Lewis-Potter (6), Norgaard (7), Yarmoliuk (7), Mbeumo (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (9), Wissa (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Jensen (6), Henry (6), Ajer (n/a), Nunes (n/a), Thiago (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd:  Bayindir (6), Fredricson (5), De Ligt (6), Shaw (4), Dorgu (5), Ugarte (7), Mainoo (6), Amass (6), Mount (7), Garnacho (8), Obi (5).\n\n\nSubs used:  Maguire (6), Yoro (6), Diallo (7), Eriksen (7), Lindelof (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kevin Schade.",
      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
