      "Liverpool will soon be getting set to face Manchester United. And new frontman Alexander Isak will be on the hunt for his first Premier League goal under Arne Slot.",
      "A 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last month ended the Reds' perfect start to this campaign and that result was followed by two more losses - to Galatasaray in the Champions League and another late on at Chelsea. Ruben Amorim's visit Anfield next, with Liverpool looking to bounce back.",
      "Isak has scored just the once as a Liverpool player so far but comes with a hefty reputation after signing for a British record fee from Newcastle. But Liverpool hero Owen thinks it is too early to doubt him and has warned any pessimists to write him and the Reds off at their peril.",
      "\"Alexander Isak is coming back after not really having a pre-season, so he's coming in and out of the starting XI to try and get sharp and fit,\" Owen told the Liverpool Echo.",
      "\"If I was putting a fan's hat on, I'd be relaxed overall. I'd be obviously disappointed with the Chelsea defeat, but Stamford Bridge is a tough place to go, it's never easy.",
      "\"I certainly can't remember ever winning there as a player. That game could have gone either way, and it's not like Liverpool are playing badly. I wouldn't be as hot and bothered as some people. It just shows how fickle football is and how quick it can change.\"",
      "Another Liverpool star who has been off with his national side is defender Robertson. His Scotland enjoyed two wins from two over the international break, beating Belarus 2-1 on Sunday and going joint-top of UEFA World Cup qualifying Group C.",
      "But some were not convinced. It was expected Steve Clarke's side would best the winless Belarus by more than a single goal and after the full-time whistle boos could be heard from the Hampden crowd.",
      "Robertson addressed this discontent, saying: \"It doesn't feel good, we can be honest with that. It doesn't feel like a win at the minute, and I think you can see that by our reaction at the end, which is hugely frustrating. The performance is nowhere near where we need it to be.",
      "\"It's a hugely frustrating night - we felt that in the stands. We'll take that on board, but come November, we've got the chance to go to a World Cup and that's what we're focused on.\"",
      "Ex-Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli endured a tough 24 months on the books at Anfield after a £16m move. He scored just four goals in 28 appearances during the 2014/15 season before being shipped off to AC Milan on loan.",
      "He would then sign for Nice and since leaving Liverpool he has played for seven different clubs. But after departing Italian side Genoa he is currently unemployed and admits he has reached a \"dead end.\"",
      "\"To be honest, I'm at a dead end,\" Balotelli told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Physically, I feel good, I'm training for myself. This summer, I had offers from abroad, but secretly I hoped to stay in Italy for another year or two. But that opportunity never came.",
      "\"I'm fit and just waiting for the right opportunity. Football is still my life, but I only want to come back when I feel I can really contribute again.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United hoped a busy summer transfer window would be the answer to Ruben Amorim's problems. However, at least one piece of business appears to have backfired after one of the new arrivals has been voted the \"worst summer signing\" by a panel of agents.",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford has been told his time at Old Trafford may not be done despite making such a strong impression at Barcelona. The outcast was sent on loan to the Camp Nou and has been looked highly promising thus far, but one former Red Devil has cautioned any permanent move may not be set in stone.",
      "Although things appear to be on the up for Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford, not everyone agrees that United got a good deal. In fact, an agent survey put together by The Athletic voted for the Slovenian as the worst signing of the summer (predominantly examining the Premier League).",
      "The Red Devils shelled out £73.6million (if all add-on conditions are met) to sign the towering striker from RB Leipzig. Sesko, 22, was brought in to replace Rasmus Hojlund (on loan at Napoli) after witnessing an excruciating struggle for goals last season.",
      "After failing to score in his last six games for United, Sesko went into the international break having scored in back-to-back games. But that didn't prevent him from receiving the most votes for worst summer signing, with twice the amount of votes received by runner-up James Trafford.",
      "\"A lot of money for not much of a pedigree,\" wrote one unimpressed agent in his explanation. Another commented: \"Way too much money and much too soon.\"",
      "Given the unceremonious manner of his United exit and the success he's enjoyed on loan away from the club, it would be hard for some to imagine the player back at Old Trafford. The 27-year-old has contributed three goals and five assists for the Blaugrana so far this season, making the potential £25m it would take to sign him permanently look that much more valuable.",
      "However, ex-United star and 1999 treble-winner Wes Brown has suggested his days at Carrington may not be over. And it's Brown's belief that Rashford's resurgence may be just the impetus needed to convince United bosses their asset deserves another chance.",
      "\"It's a tough one. He's there for the season, and then nothing is guaranteed,\" he told 10bet Casino. \"I said before that I thought he would do well. He's got the mentality to succeed, and we'd need to see how it worked for him, and it's started really well so far.",
      "\"Would I bring him back? I can't say for sure, because it depends on what the manager wants next season, and it'll be up to him and the player. You can see, though, that Marcus is loving life in Barcelona, and when your life is good, your football is good. It's as simple as that.\"",
      "He continued: \"He's enjoying it, and I hope it carries on for him, regardless of the club he's at. If it was decided that he comes back to United and he's still in this form, then it's only a good thing.\"",
      "The eyes of many a United fan lit up when talk arose of a late summer bid for Brighton's Baleba, only for the club to baulk at his £100m valuation. But the Red Devils' recruitment staff may have the next big thing in their sights after UOL reported they're interested in signing Corinthians anchor Breno Bidon.",
      "There could well be a need for midfield additions in 2026 amid speculation Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo will both move on next summer. Casemiro, 33, is nearing the end of his contract at Old Trafford, while Mainoo doesn't appear to figure in Amorim's plans at present.",
      "Bidon, 20, is a rounded asset who can function in both halves of the pitch and has already made 87 senior appearances for Corinthians. He also currently shares a dressing room with ex-United winger Memphis Depay, though that could work for against the English giants.",
      "According to UOL, Manchester City, Napoli and Wolves are also interested in the player, with Middle Eastern clubs also in the hunt. However, there is a slight need to act quickly considering Eredivisie champions PSV are understood to have already tabled an £8m offer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Mkhitaryan has played under footballing giants such as Jurgen Klopp, Thomas Tuchel, Simeone Inzaghi, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho. Unsurprisingly, the midfielder, 36, has enjoyed varying relationships with each as he matured through his career.",
      "As you might expect, the most conflict came under Mourinho's coaching at Manchester United. Mkhitaryan explained he grew under the coach but there were a number of unpleasant confrontations.",
      "“Mourinho called me, he told me he wanted me in Manchester, because I had a crazy season according to him. It’s an opportunity you might get, maybe, once in your career,\" Mkhitaryan told TuttoMercatoWeb.",

      "“I’m not saying that we had a bad relationship as human beings, but as a coach and player, we always had unpleasant confrontations.",
      "“He wanted to see if you were mentally strong, if you could play in the games that matter the most, in the league and Champions League. This is his way of coaching and understanding people, to see if he can trust you.\"",
      "Mkhitaryan also revealed Mourinho didn't congratulate him when United won the Europa League. \"He didn’t give me his hand,\" the star said.",
      "\"Maybe he forgot, or maybe he wanted to see how I’d react. I didn’t pay attention to it at the time, but it still left a mark on me. I’d ask myself ‘why’. But, I learned that you don’t need a hug for somebody to tell you you’ve done well.”",
      "Mikhitaryan enjoyed a closer relationship with Klopp at Borussia Dortmund. “He was always available whenever you wanted to talk to him, regardless of whether you wanted to talk about football or problems in life,\" Mikhitaryan said.",
      "\"I will always be grateful to him, because I did have some difficulties at Dortmund.\"",
      "And Mkhitaryan managed to achieve a strong relationship with Klopp's replacement too. Thomas Tuchel was appointed and persauded the Armenia internation not to depart after a tough season.",
      "\"Klopp left, Tuchel replaced him and I wanted to leave. I didn’t feel great physically or mentally,\" Mkhitaryan explained.",
      "\"I had an agreement with Dortmund to leave. Tuchel, however, came in and said he wanted to talk to me and to trust him. He said ‘trust me, you’ll get 15 goals and 15 assists in this position’. I laughed because I’d lost confidence. Even my agent, Raiola, was telling me to leave.",
      "“In the end, I had a great season and the credit must go to him. He brought my confidence and the joy of playing football back.”",
      "One coach had an impact on Mkhitaryan even before working with however. \"It was for Wenger,\" said the 36-year-old of his Arsenal passion.",
      "\"I spent six wonderful months with him before they let him go. We played the attacking football that he likes.",

However, the former midfielder has not worked in that capacity for six years since departing Forest with Martin O'Neill.",

Brown believes Keane's notorious intensity could be an asset and that he will have learned how to channel that in a modern management setting.",

The victory provided some respite for the Red Devils boss, who has faced questions regarding his reluctance to abandon his favoured system.",
      "United icons Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville are amongst some of his most vocal detractors of late. Rooney did, though, perform a U-turn after the Sunderland win, lauding the strategy employed in that match.",
      "Ex-defender Brown has similarly commended Amorim for maintaining his convictions.",
      "\"If you get the result you need then your critics can't say anything anymore,\" he told 10bet Casino.",
      "\"If Amorim wins, there won't be any problems with the press.",
      "\"Bad results obviously brought some criticism from ex-players like Gary and Wazza - but what I like about Ruben is that he stuck to his guns and defended his methods. He carried on when it would have been easier to change.",
      "\"Instead, he's still getting the players to do what he wants, to understand their jobs. But, sometimes at United, and this is true for any team, it's 11 players against 11. It's not always the manager's fault, because they can't fix individual errors and mistakes.",
      "\"That happens in football, but I think it's been a particular problem at United in games. I think when they are cut out too, things will look up quickly.\"",
      "Amorim is still on the hunt for his first consecutive wins as United boss. After triumphing over Sunderland, he has the opportunity to achieve this when his squad face off against fierce rivals Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's team are currently experiencing a slump of their own - having suffered defeat in their last three matches across all competitions.",

      "Joey Barton has launched a furious X-rated tirade against Wayne Rooney and the ex-Manchester United star's suspicion of conspiracy over the dramatic circumstances in which Manchester City claimed the Premier League title with a final-day win over Queens Park Rangers.",
      "United were already celebrating winning the league after beating Sunderland, before City launched a late comeback, capped off by Sergio Aguero's iconic strike, to win the Premier League. QPR went into the game fighting for top-flight survival but knew they would be safe before the final whistle.",
      "That has seen Rooney voice criticism that the Hoops were happy to let City stage their comeback. The former England captain was recently criticised by Djibril Cisse for questioning the fact that the forward was seen 'celebrating' with City players after the game.",
      "And now, Barton has rubbished Rooney's theory and explained why it was incorrect. The ex-QPR and Man City midfielder did not hesitate to take digs at Rooney either.",
      "Speaking on the Common Sense podcast, Barton said: \"There's been a bit of a spat online between Djibril Cisse and Wayne Rooney. Rooney has said that the game was bent and that QPR threw that game.",
      "\"I'm only commenting on it because he referenced me in it. Half of our team knew we were safe and stayed up and half of our team didn't. You can see when you see it.",
      "\"Five or six of the team did. I can hear it getting shouted from the sidelines. We had all been in City's academy. You had Nedum Onuoha, Shaun Wright-Phillips and myself. So we would have wanted Manchester City to win the league over Man United, make no bones about that.",
      "\"But at the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people's results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "\"I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don't think Paddy knew.",
      "\"You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don't think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.\"",
      "\"So Wayne, and the other Man United fans - and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me - no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That's where the buck stops with me.",
      "\"Your conspiracy theories, Wazza, are untrue. Sometimes people tell you stuff in life and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative and you want to have that cognitive dissonance.",
      "\"It might be the same fellas who were saying that if you get one more hair transplant it might come back. This might be the time you get a fringe. As you found out, that is complete nonsense.",
      "\"Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn't go out my way to make City win the league.",
      "\"To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don't win the league is b****cks.",
      "\"You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn't. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That's your fault.",
      "\"The fact he's even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.",
      "At the end of the rant, Barton added: \"QPR stayed up, happy days. City won the league, happy days. And you ****s were all crying on the pitch at the f***ing Stadium of f***ing Light or Middlesbrough or wherever you was, which is f***ing triple whammy. Get f***ed.\"",

      "Manchester United forward Matheus Cunha has admitted that the Brazil team don't know how they will play each game under Carlo Ancelotti and opened up on how his life has changed since signing for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Cunha has been with the Brazil squad during the international break, putting in a good performance against South Korea on Friday, with his country winning 5-0. He'll be in action against Japan next before returning to United.",
      "Speaking to Globo while with in Asia for Brazil's two friendlies, Cunha explained why working with Ancelotti has been so beneficial for him, citing formation change as one of the aspects he and the team thrive from.",
      "\"One of Ancelotti's greatest strengths is getting the best out of each player,\" began the former Wolverhampton Wanderers player. \"I came to the national team with this stereotype of a number nine shirt. I play my entire base as a midfielder and when I became a professional, I encountered this world of 4-3-3.",
      "\"It seems like you have to adapt: either play centre forward, winger, or eight. They eliminated the midfielder position and you have to adapt. However, I view it positively, as it has given me experience in many more positions and even more so in short-term tournaments with the national team. Having a versatile player is a huge help for any coach.\"",
      "He continued by touching on his experience with United - something which Ancelotti has been speaking to him about: \"I've been very happy to be here for a while, especially now with Ancelotti. We talk about the games at Manchester, the positioning between the lines and without a doubt, we have the freedom to be ourselves and perform at our best on the pitch.",
      "\"Even though we don't know how we'll play the next game in terms of formation, everyone feels great. Training is going really well. Even though it may seem like he's just picking players for the same position, Ancelotti understands how to get the best out of everyone on the pitch. It's something that makes me very happy and excited to come and perform at my best.\"",
      "One of the most high-profile signings of the summer, Cunha's presence at the elite level was massively boosted after securing a move to United. The fiery forward touched on this when speaking to A Bola.",
      "\"I try as hard as possible to adapt and learn,\" he said. \"It's only been two months, but it feels like I've been at the club for a long time. Given the current situation and the fact that I have to deliver results as quickly as possible because I'm a new signing.",
      "\"I think that because I play for Manchester United and people follow me more on the pitch, they understand better how I play. I think it's part of having that weight, which is a privilege. It's a weight that came after the Tokyo Olympics. And if it means having that weight and becoming a champion, I think it's worth putting up with a little bit of confusion about where Matheus plays.",
      "\"It makes it easier for fans to follow the games. Manchester Utd games are shown more on Brazilian television. I left the country very young and being able to follow me every week connects me with them because United is a club with many Brazilian fans.\"",
      "In an interview with GE while in Seol during the international break, Cunha also noted that being a Brazilian international while at United brings fresh perspective for him.",
      "\"Being here now with the national team, at United, is, without a doubt, a different level, a different moment as a player,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm trying as much as possible to adapt, to learn... It's only been two months, but it feels like I've been here for a long time because of the club's current situation, because I have to deliver results as quickly as possible, because I'm a new signing... All of this helps me adapt more quickly and feel my best with the national team.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner is leading the charge in an unprecedented era of Crystal Palace success in the modern era. But the Austrian's work is far from complete as he aims to build on last season's FA Cup triumph and a dream return to European football.",
      "The steps Palace take in the coming months could well play an instrumental role in shaping the club's future for years to come. And not all of them will be easy, particularly if that includes parting ways with players who have become so beloved by the club's fanbase.",
      "There isn't a soul at Selhurst Park who will like the idea of selling an asset as valuable as Manchester United target Wharton. Signed from Blackburn in February 2024 for a fairly modest £18million fee, the 21-year-old has quickly acclimated to the Premier League standard and become a beacon in Glasner's XI.",
      "But Palace remain among that middle rung of Premier League teams who still need to sell when big offers present themselves in order to thrive as an organisation. Just as Brighton's model has proved, there is scope to lose such an asset in the short term and use those funds to better the club long term, though it helps to have ready-made replacements waiting in the wings.",
      "The examples of Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have shown there is life to be had after such losses. Glasner lost his battle to keep Eze out of Arsenal's clutches this summer, but replacement Yeremy Pino is already writing his own storied success in south London.",
      "Palace has an obvious candidate as to whom might succeed Wharton should he leave. Northern Ireland international Justin Devenny has shown he has the makings of a midfield star, while the recruitment team will have their own ideas as to which signings might be able to fulfil the same duties.",
      "There's already talk of Wharton fetching at least three times his transfer fee, and that's before negotiations for a sale are even underway. Given his age and the fact his contract doesn't expire until 2029, there's plenty cause for optimism any final fee would be significantly more.",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish has already made a somewhat ominous nod to Wharton's aspirations of playing Champions League football. And it's a good thing his potential has crystallised so early on after his move, giving the Eagles plenty of time to plot their move before his contract becomes even a slight concern.",
      "The fact remains, however, that it will likely only be a matter of time before Palace have to consider a high-profile sale. And given it looks simpler to replace Wharton in midfield than certain other players in key positions, cutting the cord sooner than later looks the smartest option.",
      "Two of those aforementioned stars in key positions who wouldn't be so easy to replace are Marc Guehi and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Palace have struck gold with this duo in particular, not just due to their skill sets but also in terms of character and relationships with the fans.",
      "In the event Wharton was sold, it would hopefully open up the funds necessary to reward two of the players so vital to success at Selhurst Park. It's common knowledge Guehi's current deal expires next summer, while Mateta's contract - which was signed in December 2024 - is due to run out in 2027.",
      "It's not often a club like Palace stumbles upon a defender-striker spine so potent as this and it should be a top priority that they remain for at least another couple of seasons. Or in Guehi's case, to at least secure a more substantial fee if it simply becomes untenable to keep him any longer.",
      "Guehi proved himself to be the model professional in the summer after captaining the club to FA Cup glory and a maiden major title. The England centre-back trained and played as normal while talk of a move to Liverpool persisted until deadline day when a last-gasp move to Anfield fell through.",
      "It's treated as something of a foregone conclusion he will end up moving to one of the European elite in 2026. That could be in January when he's free to discuss a transfer with any suitors, or in the summer when he'll be out of contract.",
      "Rather than accept that fate, Guehi is one player who should motivate Palace to break policy and offer the competitive wages needed to convince their captain to stay. Having already made history as skipper, the 25-year-old could still go on to forge the making of a new dynasty, rather than allow that FA Cup win to become an anomaly.",
      "The argument to reward Mateta so handsomely isn't as strong given he'll turn 29 next June, yet trends are there to be broken. Having just made his debut for France, Mateta has reached his pomp late after scoring 36 Premier League goals across the last two seasons, the kind of numbers that can't be taken for granted.",
      "Tying down the duo to more lucrative deals would act as a statement of intent that Palace isn't content with the usual 'selling club' model. And in turn, that should help the club in further enhancing its rising reputation as a destination of interest for big talents.",
      "Heartless as it might sound, sacrifices may have to be made in Palace's debut campaign in Europe. The sentimental will dream of continental silverware at the first time of asking, but that shouldn't be the goal if it leads to a higher risk of stagnation in years to come.",
      "In that pursuit, the focus should still remain on qualifying for one of Europe's higher-tier competitions through their league placement. The Eagles should have been playing in the Europa League this season before the ownership controversy relegated them to the Conference League, and the response should be a calculated reluctance to fully commit to the competition.",
      "Palace sat sixth in the Premier League heading into the international break and were the first team to break Liverpool's perfect start this season. That result signified just what this team is capable of against England's elite, albeit such results inevitably will become more difficult as the campaign progresses.",
      "Things have started well in Europe after a 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv but complications are certain to arise as the weeks progress. And in those events where Glasner faces a choice between risking certain key assets or rotating his team for Europe, he should opt for the latter.",
      "It was barely two years ago that West Ham won the Conference League themselves and appeared to be in the midst of a revival. Fast-forward to today and already much of the good will built up by that historic title win has been lost, showing how quickly things can change for a club batting above its average without the right structures in place.",
      "Therefore, it would be in Palace's best interests to keep their focus on domestic matters and treat the Conference League as a bonus (though a very appealing one). Ungrateful as that might sound right now, it's only because of the faith that there are even greater honours to fight for in the not-too-distant future if the club plays its cards right.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Pogba made the move to Monaco on a free transfer this summer, following his departure from Juventus last November after being hit with a ban. The French international was slapped with a four-year ban in February 2024 due to elevated testosterone levels, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport later reduced it to 18 months, accepting that his ingestion of a banned substance \"was not intentional.\"",
      "Although Pogba was still contracted to Juventus at the time of his ban, he had already left the club by the time he was allowed to return to training in January 2025, following the mutual termination of his contract. In June, Pogba put pen to paper on a two-year deal with Monaco, which will see him stay with the Ligue 1 outfit until the summer of 2027.",
      "However, the 32-year-old is yet to debut for Les Monegasques, having missed nine matches due to fitness issues. That said, Pogba has been putting in the hard yards to get ready for his debut, sharing a series of photos from the training ground with his new club on Instagram on Sunday.",
      "Pogba and Lingard have shared the pitch for the Red Devils on two separate stints. Both players emerged from the United youth system in 2011, but Pogba only made three Premier League appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson before being transferred to Juventus on a free.",
      "This decision was one that United would later regret, as they re-signed him from the Serie A giants in 2016 for a then-world record fee of £89million.",
      "In total, Pogba scored 39 goals and provided 51 assists in 233 appearances for United - including his initial stint. However, he returned to Juve on a free transfer once again in 2022.",
      "Lingard, on the other hand, stayed at Old Trafford until 2022, despite spending a significant portion of his United career on loan with Leicester City, Birmingham City, Brighton and Hove Albion, Derby and West Ham.",
      "He subsequently signed a permanent deal with Nottingham Forest, where he spent just one year before moving to FC Seoul last February.",

      "Former Manchester United ace Nani believes that Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were both showing signs of \"stress and pressure\" in the early weeks of the season following their summer moves.",
      "The pair both moved to Old Trafford - which cost the club £133million. United activated Cunha's release clause in his Wolves contract to make him their first summer signing before they eventually got a deal over the line to land Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United struggled in the opening weeks of the season, winning just one of their first five games in all competitions. Cunha and Mbeumo both missed penalties in the humiliating Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby and only found their best form in moments.",
      "Nani maintained that the duo needed time to adapt to the demands of playing in Manchester. Mbeumo himself has got off the mark, scoring twice, but Cunha remains without a goal, owing in part to an injury lay off, but both men are tipped to make a strong impact.",
      "He told GiveMeSport: “I think they will bring a lot of good things. Like I said, to play for Man United is not the same as playing for any team. There’s a lot of pressure, there’s a lot of history behind it. These players, they’ve got quality, they’ve got power, we know they can do something – but they need time.",
      "“At the beginning of the season, you could see probably some stress, some pressure on top of them, some responsibility, you know. But once they stabilise, they’ll do what they know.”",
      "Old Trafford has been a place where big names go and fail to deliver - a trend dating back well over a decade. United have spent big to sign numerous players who were big successes before they headed to Manchester, only to struggle to replicate that form. The signings of Cunha and Mbeumo were motivated by the fact both men have proven themselves in England.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo have both netted against United at their previous club. The latter endured a difficult first return to Brentford recently with the Bees beating the Red Devils 3-1 in west London as the pressure further ramped up on Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese boss needs his new signings to click into gear if they are to climb the table. Mbeumo and Cunha were joined by £74m man Benjamin Sesko, who joined from RB Leipzig, with those in Manchester accepting they need much more firepower.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson, in the eyes of many, is the greatest manager to ever live. His success and honours, first at Aberdeen, then Manchester United, across several decades go before him.",
      "But what about those who learned from him? There's plenty who claim that a manager's legacy is in part down to how they influence those around them. Johan Cruyff to Pep Guardiola an obvious example. The Manchester City boss has seen a number of those close to him - Mikel Arteta and Xabi Alonso - since go on to prove themselves in the dugout.",
      "For Ferguson he's seen many of his pupils struggle to translate being a great player into a great manager. The Class of 92 were the bedrock of United's success, but few of those have made impressive careers in the dugout.",
      "There are some exceptions and others still have time to prove themselves. Michael Carrick is someone tipped to enjoy an impressive spell as a manager and he's now linked with the Rangers job.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy are more big names to turn their hand to management. The latter had an interim stint in Manchester and does have honours of his CV.",
      "None of Fergie's disciples have truly become icons of management. There are trophies and promotions smattered with sackings and fading into obscurity for the most part. Laurent Blanc achieved plenty of success with PSG after winning a title with Bordeaux and is probably the most accomplished for now. But when it's all said and done, who could be remembered as the best?",
      "Carrick enjoyed a steady spell with Middlesbrough before being relieved of his duties but he has already had an endorsement from Cristiano Ronaldo for what he can achieve as a coach. The midfielder was understated during his playing career and his experience at the very top without being a superstar who cannot connect should stand him in good stead.",
      "The former England star will be suited to a higher level of football and should thrive when given his opportunity. Even outside of management, he is preparing for the top in a technical observer role with UEFA.",
      "A shout-out for Robin van Persie too. The legendary forward is flying with Feyenoord and could soon be pressing his case.",
      "If you wanted to be harsh, you might say the managerial careers of Ferguson’s United charges show he was a man who developed players rather than bosses. More generously, you might use it to argue his singular managerial talents were something not even he could teach.",
      "There has been as much good as bad with even the more successful of Fergie’s charges. Steve Bruce and Mark Hughes both had high moments in the Premier League but looking at the relative decline of the pair makes it hard to make the case for them now, while Blanc surely had plenty of other influences to call upon before his late-career stint under Ferguson’s tutelage.",
      "Others might eventually make something big happen, with Van Nistelrooy’s fast start derailed by his Leicester nightmare and Heinze going down the No.2 path for now - with some success - after an up-and-down career as the main man across the Americas.",
      "Instead, I’m giving the nod to Mark Robins, who worked wonders in his second Coventry spell to earn two promotions despite a litany of off-field distractions - and even came within inches of stunning United in an FA Cup semi-final.",
      "It’s not a great hit rate for Fergie, but Robins’ success came in a manner which would do his old mentor proud. Indeed, Ferguson himself had to overcome challenging spells before the success came, not least with a must-win cup tie where he was rescued by none other than Robins himself, so this one seems appropriate.",
      "The United job is a poisoned chalice - and there’s only been one of Sir Alex’s former stars brave enough to claim the role. And that’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Despite a difficult spell at Cardiff City, the Norwegian was a convenient if clever appointment by Red Devils chiefs in 2018. It immediately got the fans on side and given the form that United enjoyed during the early weeks of his tenure, it was a productive move.",
      "Remarkably, he has managed the most games of any United boss since Ferguson’s retirement, a fact that shouldn't be forgotten. And while Solskjaer did not manage to win a trophy and his spell in charge did not end in the best way, the fact he managed to stabilise what has been a perennially sinking ship is notable.",
      "Sure, Blanc has the trophies and the pedigree. But the sheer fact that Solskjaer managed to make United look like a relatively competent outfit during his time in charge is arguably one of his biggest accomplishments.",
      "It is easy to look at Blanc and claimed that anyone can win with PSG, although it must be said the manner of his success was quite something. The French job maybe didn't go as planned but his best managerial achievement is certainly claiming the title with Bordeaux.",
      "Landing Ligue 1 in 2009 was a truly stunning effort. It was only Bordeaux's sixth league title in their history and their first in a decade. Blanc's managerial prowess was underlined the following year when they enjoyed a run to the last eight of the Champions League - which included securing a historic win over Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena as they twice downed the German giants.",
      "Among Ferguson's homegrown players, Carrick has all the hallmarks of a manager who could go on to have an impressive managerial career. He had an unbeaten interim stint in Manchester in the wake of Solskjaer's sacking.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's shortage of on-field leaders represents Ruben Amorim's most pressing challenge - at least according to former Premier League frontman Emile Heskey. The Red Devils have endured a troubling campaign, prompting scrutiny over Amorim's tactical blueprint.",
      "United are in 10th place in the Premier League standings, managing three victories, one draw and three defeats from their opening seven top-flight games. They also suffered an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two outfit Grimsby Town.",
      "The team, however, emerged as 2-0 victors against Sunderland in their final game before October's international break. It's a result they will aim to capitalise on when Premier League action resumes next weekend.",
      "Much discussion has centred on Amorim's unwillingness to abandon his preferred 3-4-2-1 system. Yet Heskey has highlighted a different concern within the United ranks.",
      "\"Nothing seems to go right for Ruben Amorim,\" he told Pundit Arena. \"Everyone keeps talking about the tactics, but when you put 11 players on the pitch, they've got to fight.",
      "\"Where's your leaders? I remember playing at Liverpool, I was only 22 at the time, we had Gary McAllister and he would be on to us. Steven Gerrard was younger than me, he would be on to us, Sami Hyypia, too.",
      "\"It doesn't look like Man Utd have any leaders on the pitch, who are really digging people out.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, United's captain, has been a constant presence on the pitch this season, missing only three minutes of their Premier League matches. However, his role within the team has sparked much debate.",
      "The arrivals of summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, both playing in attacking positions, has seen Fernandes shifted to a deeper role. It has led to some questioning whether this allows him to perform at his best.",
      "Ahead of Portugal's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland last week, Fernandes addressed these concerns, stating: \"I love playing football, whatever the position.",
      "\"They can put me at full-back, winger, or as a goalkeeper. I'll always give my best.\"",
      "He added: \"Everyone has their preferences. But we have to adapt to the coach's ideas.\"",

      "Manchester United’s board remain behind Ruben Amorim, having previously reached a ‘unanimous’ decision over his predecessor. The Portuguese coach is under huge pressure at Old Trafford following a woeful start to the season.",
      "United sit tenth in the Premier League following just three league wins since the start of the campaign. That has seen Amorim’s future called into question, with chiefs having already held crisis talks over his future.",
      "Earlier this month, it was revealed that Old Trafford powerbrokers had spoken to players about their head coach - coming away with the impression the dressing room remain fully behind him.",
      "As it stands, United are retain faith in their manager, with confidence he will eventually get it right. Amorim may feel slightly fortunate that he has been given a stay of execution given the same privilege was not afforded to his predecessor Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman endured a woeful third season at the club despite having lifted the FA Cup the campaign before and was consequently sacked. Before he was officially jettisoned, United held a board meeting to decide Ten Hag’s future, with all of the prominent chiefs voting ‘unanimously’ for the former Ajax man to be moved on.",
      "And while a decision on Amorim’s own future will be one decided by the club’s bosses, the opinion of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is sure to hold considerable weight. As it stands, it appears that the Ineos boss is keen to see the former Sporting Lisbon man remain in the hotseat.",
      "Asked if Amorim is set to be given time, Ratcliffe said: \"Yes. That is where I would be. Three years. Because football is not overnight.",
      "\"It's three years. You also look at [Mikel] Arteta at Arsenal. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years. We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Pressed on whether the Glazers would have a say, Ratcliffe replied: \"It's not going to happen,\" before adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground. They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",

Spanish outlet Estadio Deportivo suggests Barcelona's choice to secure Rashford permanently could become unavoidable, should he keep up his current level of performance for club and country.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "But Mainoo's continued England exile is a measure of just how far he has fallen since scoring and starring in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City last year and starting that 2-1 defeat for the Three Lions in Berlin's Olympic Stadium seven weeks later.",
      "While some of United's players not representing their countries have taken the time off for some rest and recuperation, escaping to the sun before reporting back for duty tomorrow, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "Mainoo has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting to his 3.3million followers on Instagram pictures and videos of himself working out and pushing himself to the limit.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Ruben Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But the brutal reality for Mainoo seems to be that however many posts he uploads of himself working on his fitness, he is simply not trusted by Amorim to start a game, and with fixtures in short supply given United's failure to qualify for Europe and EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby, his exile is likely to continue.",
      "Against that backdrop, it will come as little surprise if Mainoo makes a fresh request to go out on loan in the January transfer window, by which time the World Cup will be just six months away, with time running out for the 20-year-old to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Tuchel's reluctance to pick Mainoo, despite the midfielder's undeniable talent, is understandable, for he cannot select players who are not playing regularly for their clubs, despite past exploits for England. Therein lies the problem for Mainoo – he has become an outcast for club and country, his career in limbo while Amorim remains in charge and refuses to trust him to start a game.",
      "The only solution to Mainoo's plight is Amorim leaving or United allowing him to leave on loan in the new year. Neither scenario seems likely, given Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent insistence that Amorim needs time and United's previous decision to turn down Mainoo's loan request.",
      "In that sense, there seems to be no escape for Mainoo from his current predicament, a bleak situation for such a bright talent.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee had the potential to become a Manchester United cult hero after overcoming adversity.",
      "Zirkzee dealt with the embarrassment of being hooked against Newcastle after 33 minutes last December and showed tremendous character in bouncing back over the subsequent weeks.",
      "The Dutchman was an entertaining watch after being switched to one of the No.10 roles. Zirkzee was signed to play as a striker, but it was obvious that he did not possess the skillset to lead the United attack.",
      "United fans rooted for Zirkzee to come good after the Newcastle substitution, although he was demoted in the squad this summer when Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arrived.",
      "Zirkzee has found opportunities hard to come by this term. Mbeumo and Cunha have been the first choice picks in the No.10 roles, while Mason Mount, Amad and Bruno Fernandes can also play there.",
      "Ruben Amorim has not started Zirkzee once, even naming him on the bench against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round. United have fewer fixtures this term and Zirkzee's chances of playing have been damaged by the early Carabao Cup exit and the failure to qualify for European football.",
      "He has recorded just 82 minutes across four appearances from the bench against Grimsby, Burnley, Manchester City and Brentford, but his current situation is not a surprise.",
      "It was predictable that Zirkzee would slip down the pecking order and become a peripheral squad member, given United's summer signings and failure to qualify for Europe.",
      "The extent of Zirkzee's demotion might be a tad surprising, though. He made positive contributions from the bench last season, but he's practically been forgotten about just months into the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Zirkzee will be concerned about his lack of involvement and it's not a surprise that reports linking him with a move away from Old Trafford in the January transfer window.",
      "The forward is aware that he must play to have a chance of making the Netherlands squad for the 2026 World Cup. Zirkzee has no chance of making Ronaldo Koeman's squad if he stays in Manchester.",
      "West Ham have been linked with a move for the Dutchman, while a return to Italy to represent Roma has also been touted, and an offer from the latter would be more attractive to the player.",
      "Zirkzee impressed during his time with Bologna in Serie A and only needs to look to his former teammate, Rasmus Hojlund, to decide why a return to Italy might be the best move for him.",
      "Hojlund has enjoyed a new lease of life since joining Napoli on transfer deadline day, scoring four goals in six appearances.",
      "The problem for Zirkzee is that although a move away in January makes perfect sense for him, does it make sense for United? He might not have started a game but he is seen as an important squad member.",
      "United are a stroke of bad luck away from needing Zirkzee and Amorim will want to keep him for the remainder of the campaign, which could end his chances of playing at the World Cup.",
      "There could be a standoff between both parties in January and it will be fascinating to see how it develops, as United pay Zirkzee's wages and ultimately have the power in discussions.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation to Kobbie Mainoo, who is desperate to play at the World Cup for England next summer. Clubs must dread a World Cup season because players are more likely to rock the boat in an attempt to secure a move for the sake of regular minutes.",
      "It's understandable that Zirkzee and Mainoo could request to leave for the sake of game time. Whether those requests will be entertained is another matter.",
      "United must be sympathetic to their situations, while also prioritising the club's interests.",

      "Manchester United are already planning to sign a new midfielder next summer. Casemiro's contract expires in June and the 33-year-old is set to depart the club on a free transfer.",
      "Wharton has emerged as one of Europe's finest midfield prospects over the last two seasons. The 21-year-old has delivered superb performances in defensive midfield for Crystal Palace, and starred in his side's FA Cup victory against Manchester City at Wembley last season.",
      "Wharton made his England debut last year and has been increasingly linked with a move to United, although Palace chairman Parish has warned he still has years remaining on his contract.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Parish said: \"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club.",
      "“He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, but I think he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get.",
      "“I think this season he’s completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It’s a difficult programme for us right now. I think he’s very committed to the club. I don’t know where all this stuff comes from.”",

      "Wharton's contract at Selhurst Park expires in the summer of 2029. The midfielder has also been linked with Liverpool and Real Madrid.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "On the face of it, Bruno Fernandes could hardly have been more positive when asked about playing in midfield for Manchester United.",
      "\"I love playing football, whatever the position,” said Fernandes, ahead of Portugal's 1-0 World Cup qualifier win over Republic of Ireland. “They can put me at full-back, winger, goalkeeper. I’ll always give my best.”",
      "But it was the follow-up remark from Fernandes that was most telling, suggesting the 31-year-old playmaker was far from happy at playing in a deeper-lying role on the insistence of boss Ruben Amorim.“Everyone has their preferences,” said United captain Fernandes. “But we have to adapt to the coach’s ideas.”",
      "The clear inference from that comment is that Fernandes would rather play in a more advanced role, where he has been most effective for United and can provide a greater attacking threat and influence.",
      "Fernandes and his camp are known to have taken umbrage at recent reports stating he is not happy with the role in which Amorim continues to deploy him and is desperate to play further up the pitch, with more freedom.",
      "What is undeniable is that being selected in midfield does not play to the attacking strengths of Fernandes. He is arguably United's most creative player and the one with the biggest goal threat, but those weapons are being nullified by where he is currently being played.",
      "In midfield, Fernandes is forced to think defensively as well as offensively, something that does not come naturally to him. It is a different mindset, focusing on thwarting opponents when you don't have the ball, rather than what you can do with it at your feet, which is where Fernandes excels.",
      "In his new role, Fernandes' objective is frequently not to unlock the opposition but to keep them under lock and key. That is likely to be the case when United return to Premier League action at arch rivals Liverpool on Sunday, where Fernandes will be tasked with being more of a spoiler than a match-winner, given how the game is likely to unfold, with the hosts enjoying greater possession, forcing Amorim's side into a policy of containment.",
      "That is not to say Fernandes is completely ill-suited to playing more centrally. His intrinsic work ethic and willingness to cover so much ground, as evidenced by some key challenges in the dying embers of United's hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea, is a key skill set for a midfielder.",
      "But Amorim's insistence on sticking with his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad or Mason Mount playing as the two behind Benjamin Sesko, means Fernandes has had to accept he is now a midfielder and will play there as long as his compatriot remains in charge.",
      "Publicly, players will rarely complain about the position they are asked to occupy and the role they are required to fulfil. Privately, though, Fernandes surely yearns for the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag, when he was able to maraud around the pitch, showcasing his prodigious attacking talent, without having to do any of the dirty work.",

      "We're here to bring you all the latest Manchester United news, reaction, and opinion following Turki Al-Sheikh's claims that a businessman is in an 'advanced stage' of purchasing the club. The Saudi Arabian billionaire clarified his comments on Thursday evening, but the rumour mill continues to churn.",
      "There's also talk of interest from the UAE, according to reports, while Sheikh Jassim, who narrowly missed out on buying United not too long ago, could be back in the game. The Qatari banker had his sights set on a full takeover of the club, but the Glazers sold a minority share to Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead.",
      "In other news, Kobbie Mainoo remains heavily linked with a move away from United. The 20-year-old midfielder pushed for a transfer from Old Trafford in the summer, seeking more game time ahead of next year's World Cup, but his request was blocked.",
      "The former Middlesbrough player Gaizka Mendieta believes Xavi would replace Ruben Amorim at United if he thought their project was the right one.",
      "Mendieta told OLBG:",
      "I think if it's the right project, he will be tempted. Who doesn't want to coach in the Premier League? Who would not want to coach Manchester United, even if it's in a difficult time?",
      "He won trophies at Barca during a very peculiar period of history of the club and he changed that. Of course, he doesn't know Manchester United as he knows Barca, but he's been there, and he knows that he's capable of doing those things.",
      "So if the project seems right to him, I'm sure he will take it. He's been preparing himself already, waiting for the chance to come.",
      "I know he's had a few options to go and coach, but it wasn't the right project. I think for a coach like him, it's the project that matters, not only the history and the club.",
      "A lot of people were hesitant about his move to Barca because he had only been in Qatar. People thought he wasn't ready, then he won the league and the Super Cup in his first season.",
      "I think football has changed a lot. The coaches and players tend to adapt.",
      "It's at an incredibly high level, and it's a lot faster because people are more prepared. There are more tools out there for coaches to gain an understanding, knowing what's happening at other clubs and with other players.",
      "He has his own platforms to understand and analyse situations. So wherever he goes, which could be Man Utd, he'll be prepared for the job he takes for sure.",
      "The former Manchester City financial adviser, Stefan Borson, has addressed claims made by Saudi government official Turki Al-Sheikh about a potential Manchester United takeover.",
      "Borson said to Football Insider:",
      "I think it’s pretty unlikely, to be honest with you. For there to be a serious process running in the background right now at a valuation that is attractive seems to me to be pretty unlikely. It’s not impossible, but it’s pretty unlikely.",
      "I mean, he is a well-connected guy. But look, in football there’s a lot of rumours, counter rumours and things people hear that are just not right.",
      "There are a lot of people sort of spouting nonsense, and you have to sort of sensor check with logic. I think it’s unlikely, but I might be embarrassed by that view very quickly.",
      "IndyKaila News claims that United officials were due to meet a United Arab Emirates-based consortium in London at 1 pm this afternoon. They cite their sources and report that UAE officials are very serious about purchasing the club, while also alleging that the Glazers are open to all possibilities.",
      "Agents have voted United's signing of Benjamin Sesko as the worst deal of last summer. Six of the 20 surveyed by The Athletic voted for the striker, double the number of James Trafford in second place.",
      "They were the only two players who received multiple votes. Antony and Jadon Sancho also received single selections.",
      "Wes Brown has refused to rule out Marcus Rashford staying at Manchester United rather than joining Barcelona permanently.",
      "Asked whether he sees any way back for Rashford at United, Brown said to 10bet Casino:",
      "It's a tough one. He's there for the season, and then nothing is guaranteed. I said before that I thought he would do well. He's got the mentality to succeed, and we'd need to see how it worked for him, and it's started really well so far.",
      "Would I bring him back? I can't say for sure, because it depends on what the manager wants next season, and it'll be up to him and the player. You can see, though, that Marcus is loving life in Barcelona, and when your life is good, your football is good. It's as simple as that.",
      "He's enjoying it, and I hope it carries on for him, regardless of the club he's at. If it was decided that he comes back to United and he's still in this form, then it's only a good thing.",
      "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has warned there is no pressure to consider offers for midfielder Adam Wharton.",
      "Manchester United are already planning to sign a new midfielder next summer. Casemiro's contract expires in June and the 33-year-old is set to depart the club on a free transfer.",
      "Wharton has emerged as one of Europe's finest midfield prospects over the last two seasons. The 21-year-old has delivered superb performances in defensive midfield for Crystal Palace, and starred in his side's FA Cup victory against Manchester City at Wembley last season.",

      "Kbbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "Read the full story here",
      "Barcelona's decision to sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal from Manchester United could reportedly become inevitable.",
      "The 27-year-old landed in Catalonia on a season-long loan in July after Reds boss Ruben Amorim made it clear he wasn't part of his plans. The Catalan giants have the option to make Rashford's move permanent for £30million in 2026.",
      "Following his impressive performances since the September international break, Barcelona are reportedly eager to secure the England forward, but are hoping for a bargain deal of around £26m. Rashford has three years remaining on his current contract at Old Trafford, which he signed in July 2023 after netting a career-high 30 goals for United in the 2022/23 season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka has ranked Bruno Fernandes ahead of Florian Wirtz and Cole Palmer when asked to order the trio based on quality.",
      "The Manchester United captain has continued to perform impressively despite a challenging few seasons for the club overall. Last season, he scored eight goals and provided 10 assists in the Premier League, while also netting seven times during United’s run to the Europa League final.",
      "Fernandes has occasionally faced criticism for his emotional reactions and leadership style since taking the armband at Old Trafford, but his numbers speak for themselves.",
      "Read more here",
      "Senne Lammens has admitted Manchester United's players have “everything to succeed” and can have no excuses for failure following the overhaul of the club's training complex.",
      "United spent £50million modernising the Carrington complex, situated half-an-hour's drive from Old Trafford, turning the tired training ground into a state-of-the-art facility.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating training facilities during his ill-fated second spell at United, which led to his acrimonious exit just before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have been told that Rasmus Hojlund is seen as one of Serie A's finest strikers.",
      "The 22-year-old forward made the move to Italian champions Italy on a season-long loan this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds boss Ruben Amorim. Despite his initial desire to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place, even with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, it appears his decision to leave has paid off.",
      "Hojlund only found the back of the net four times in the Premier League for United last season, contributing to the club's disappointing 15th-place finish in the English top flight. However, in just six appearances across Serie A and the Champions League, Hojlund has already matched that goal tally under Napoli manager Antonio Conte.",

      "Senne Lammens had a bit of a shaky start on his first day at the Carrington Training Complex. The 23-year-old goalkeeper has already made a significant impact at Manchester United following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp, despite an initial hiccup.",
      "As reported by GiveMeSport, some members of the dressing room were 'strongly advocating' for the Old Trafford higher-ups to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. The 33-year-old goalkeeper was heavily rumoured to be moving throughout the summer after what appeared to be an emotional goodbye on the last day of the previous season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United news.",
      "It may be the international break but there's been plenty to talk about at Old Trafford over the past week or so. The takeover rumour mill has been in overdrive although claims from Turki Al-Sheikh have since been clarified.",
      "And the Reds are less than a week away from returning to action where they travel to rivals Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Stick with us throughtout the day for all the latest.",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog today.",
      "We will be back here tomorrow bringing you more of the latest news from Old Trafford.",
      "Until then, good night!",
      "Speaking to United In Focus, journalist Graeme Bailey has claimed that United have U-turned on Fernandes.",
      "Last summer, the club did not want to sell the midfielder.",
      "However, it is believed that the Reds' stance has now altered and talks have been held with Saudi Pro League clubs over a price.",
      "Bailey added that Fernandes is determined to decide his own future and not be forced out by those higher up.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Daily Mirror, Harry Maguire is ready to reject a whopping £500,000 per week contract offer from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The centre-back is out of contract at the end of this season but negotiations are underway to extend his stay in Manchester.",
      "Should United offer him a new deal, Maguire is believed to be keen to stay and would reject the Saudi millions.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with AS, Antony has insisted that a new signing at Old Trafford urged him to stay at the club.",
      "Explaining the situation, the winger said:",
      "Matheus Cunha wanted me to play there with him, but the situation was already very difficult. I have a lot of affection for him.",
      "Well, it is hard to argue with the fact that Zidane is one of the best head coaches in world football.",
      "His stock has only risen since being out of work and his next job will be chosen carefully.",
      "Whether he would choose United if offered the opportunity remains to be seen, but if Amorim was to ever leave United and Zidane was offered the job, I doubt there would be many, if any, Reds complaining.",
      "One name that seemingly always comes up when the United job is mentioned is Zinedine Zidane.",
      "As quoted by One Football, Zidane does not mention United as one of the priority jobs that he would like to take.",
      "For sure I’m returning to work as head coach, it’s my plan. My desire is to become France head coach one day. Let’s see. Me at Juventus? I don’t know why it didn’t happen. I always keep that team in my heart because it gave me a lot.",
      "According to The Independent, United will be needing to splash £70m if they are to convince Bournemouth to sell their talisman in the January transfer window or beyond.",
      "Unfortunately for the Reds, they are not the team in pole position to sign the forward.",
      "It is believed that Spurs are leading the way as they look to splash the cash to cement their place at the top end of the table.",
      "Speaking to BestBettingSites, via The Mirror, Chris Waddle has insisted that Bournemouth's talisman Antoine Semenyo would be perfect for United.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now. Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players. I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now. People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still. If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "While the Reds are keen on Wharton, there is a scenario where his current manager, Oliver Glasner, could join him at Old Trafford.",
      "Glasner has been linked with replacing Amorim should United choose to sack the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Currently, Ratcliffe is keen to stick with Amorim but could be tempted to U-turn if performances and results don't improve.",
      "Glasner is due to be a free agent at the end of this season but Parish has confirmed that talks have been held with the Austrian regarding a new contract.",
      "When asked directly about United's interest in Wharton, Parish was not shocked by that development.",
      "He continued on talkSPORT:",
      "If Manchester United want Adam Wharton, there's nothing surprising really about that. The fact of the matter is he's got a long contract to run. There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.",
      "That's according to Palace chairman Steve Parish who sat down with talkSPORT earlier.",
      "Speaking to journalists Henry Winter and Sean Custis, Parish was asked about the future of his talented midfielder.",
      "I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Sunday Mirror, United are planning a £60m move for Wharton in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed by United that an offer in that region will be enough to tempt Wharton to the Reds.",
      "The 21-year-old's current deal at Selhurst Park is due to expire in 2029.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United blog this Sunday afternoon.",
      "We are just a week away from United returning to action in the Premier League when they visit Liverpool.",
      "The clash will see two teams face each other who are both interested in the man below...",
      "Dylan James believes United could offer Crystal Palace a couple of player in exchange for Adam Wharton.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, a man once tipped to be the next best thing, does not get much game time anymore and requested a loan move during the summer for that exact reason. His loan request was blocked, so it's likely the 20-year-old will want to leave on a permanent transfer during the January window.",
      "Another player that United could offer up is Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee. Although he doesn't match Wharton's more deep-lying position in midfield, the swap offer could provide Palace with extra firepower behind Mateta.",
      "United will have to qualify for the Champions League just to stand a chance of signing Adam Wharton. Speaking on talkSPORT, Steve Parish revealed the midfielder's desire to play on the European stage.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" said the Crystal Palace chairman.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get.",
      "\"I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from...\"",
      "According to The Sun, United will not consider Thomas Tuchel as an option if they sack Ruben Amorim. The report claims that the former Chelsea boss met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe shortly before the Reds axed Erik ten Hag.",
      "Tuchel was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, but he took the England job and United opted for Amorim.",
      "According to Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, Roma have identified Joshua Zirkzee as a 'top target'. The report claims the Serie A outfit are also keen on Folarin Balogun at Monaco and Lucas Stassin at Saint-Etienne."

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford is currently on international duty with England.",
      "Rashford sat down with ITV Sport before the Three Lions' game against Latvia and was asked about Thomas Tuchel's assessment that he only needs consistency to become world-class.",
      "His answer received attention from the media. \"For sure, consistency is a massive part of it. I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time,\" said Rashford.",
      "\"So it is even more difficult to be consistent, but I completely agree, I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "\"When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train. We have just had so many changes so far in my career but I have to look forward and that it definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often. When I am at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport.\"",
      "The first part of Rashford's answer has been interpreted as a critique of United over the last nine years, but some fans have argued the 27-year-old must take responsibility himself.",
      "Rashford and those supporters are correct - both can be true. United have been a dysfunctional club, which has not been conducive to high performance, but Rashford has not helped himself along the way.",
      "Louis van Gaal handed Rashford his debut in 2016 and he played for a further four permanent United managers - Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Three interim United managers, Michael Carrick, Ralf Rangnick and Ruud van Nistelrooy, have also worked with Rashford, so it's fair to say the environment at United has been \"inconsistent.\"",
      "Those managerial changes at United have happened in the same timeframe as Pep Guardiola's reign at Manchester City (Guardiola was appointed at the Etihad in the summer of 2016).",
      "There is no denying that the environment has not been right at United, although it would be naive to suggest that the situation at Carrington is the only reason for Rashford's inconsistency.",
      "There have been concerns about Rashford's off-field behaviour in recent years, and he even survived a boozy jaunt to Belfast because Ten Hag believed it would be detrimental to freeze him out of his plans.",
      "Ten Hag disciplined Rashford, but Amorim subsequently saw something he did not agree with, which led him to drop the academy graduate for the Manchester derby last December.",
      "A combination of the environment at United and Rashford's poor choices has contributed to his inconsistency, ultimately preventing him from becoming a world-class player.",
      "There are no more excuses for Rashford at Barcelona. The Catalan club have a winning environment, with a superb manager in place, and everything is right for him to succeed.",
      "Rashford appears to have taken that opportunity, scoring three goals and recording six assists in Spain, although he was recently dropped for a game against Getafe after being late to a team meeting.",
      "The Wythenshawe-born forward was only two minutes late, but Hansi Flick enforced a disciplinary rule that meant he lost his starting role.

      "Manchester United centre-forward Rasmus Hojlund and his family hold no animosity towards the club for the manner in which his time at Old Trafford was cut short two years after his £72m arrival.",
      "The Dane joined the Reds in 2023 and after enjoying a productive first season at Old Trafford, with 16 goals, Hojlund's statistics dipped in his second campaign as Ruben Amorim arrived in Manchester. He managed just four Premier League goals with the pressure on the 22-year-old, Amorim decided this summer that the striker's future was better served away from the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "A loan switch to Napoli was agreed and since leaving United, Hojlund has scored four goals in six appearances for the Italian champions and has another four goals for Denmark.",
      "Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport, Christian Mouroux who is a friend of Hojlund's family and the current sporting director at HUI Football, the forward's childhood team in Denmark, explained why there was a sense of surprise when he was immediately thrust into the key role of leading the line at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I think Rasmus didn’t expect to be the main striker when United first showed interest in him,\" Mouroux said. \"I think he would have been fine as an intern for the main striker position for the first year or two.",
      "\"However, this status somehow changed during the recruitment process, and he became the main guy for United overnight. I think he took that challenge head on and with the type of confidence of, okay, well if that is what United thinks of me then let me try and be that from the beginning.",
      "\"He was perhaps a little too young [for United]. Rasmus’ abilities fit very, very well to the Premier League and English football so I think it was a good signing, it was well scouted and I think Rasmus proved both before he came to United and also now as he left for Napoli that he has strong abilities as a powerful No.9 and he can score goals.\"",
      "While there may have been some confusion as to why Hojlund was suddenly the first choice at Old Trafford, Mouroux was keen to stress that there was never any animosity towards United from the family. \"I last saw him was at the beginning of his time at United and it was when he was scoring goals,\" he added. \"At that point he was very happy. I have chatted with his father on a few occasions since then, also during the more difficult period at United.",
      "\"And I must say I think this family is extraordinary in every sense of the word when it comes to professionalism. They keep their nose on track and even during the difficult times, they are focused on what they can do to improve.",
      "\"I’ve never been in dialogue with the family at any point where they felt particularly frustrated. They were more constructive around wanting to be a success with and for United.\"",
      "Hojlund's loan move to Napoli has seen him reinvigorate his career with goals coming a lot more frequently. Mouroux feels that has a lot to do with the difference in environment in Naples.",
      "\"When you come from a team that isn’t living up to expectations, it will take a toll on a player’s confidence and it takes a toll on how you interact within the team,\" he said. \"So it takes a lot of effort to try and break that cycle.",
      "\"It is just the fact that he has come into a different environment, a breath of fresh air, new ideas, a new team that has been successful and he has managed to go with that flow. He also comes in with more experience after two years at United, he is a better player now.",
      "\"He also came from the Italian league so he knows what it is about and he has McTominay who comes from the same environment as him so he can help with the on-boarding. I just think he is in a really good environment for him.",
      "\"I think it was the right decision for him to go, and his performances show that.\"",

      "Manchester United resume their Premier League campaign at Anfield next week buoyed by the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last time out.",
      "It was a convincing performance from the Reds and relieved some of the pressure on under-fire boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "United are 10th in the table and will hope to find consistency to sustain a challenge for a top six spot and European football next season.",
      "To do that, they need key players to perform and two United stars have hit their straps in recent weeks, offering Amorim an added dimension, competition and attacking threat.",
      "Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the scorers against Sunderland and both look set to keep their places for the trip to Liverpool.",
      "Mount has suffered two injury-hit years since his arrival at Old Trafford but Amorim has remained convinced that the England international has plenty to offer if fully-fit.",
      "The 26-year-old played in one of the two number 10 roles against Sunderland and opened the scoring with a smart finish. Mount has been used in a plethora of positions already this term but that attacking midfield role is the best fit for his capabilities as he seeks to recapture his best form.",
      "Mount kept summer signing Matheus Cunha out of the side against Sunderland and having players of quality coming off the bench as game-changing options is something United have lacked in recent seasons.",
      "For Mount himself, there is a steely determination to showcase his talent this season as he seeks to help United erase the memories of a disappointing 2024-25 campaign which ended with a 15th place finish in the Premier League and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "\"A lot of people have said a lot of stuff about us as a group, and we ball that up and we use that energy in the best way we can, and that's on the football pitch against other teams, and really competing and fighting for those three points,\" admitted Mount earlier this season.",
      "Mount was joined on the scoresheet against Sunderland by Sesko, who netted his second goal since his summer arrival.",
      "The Slovenia international is beginning to make his mark up front and if he can offer the consistent goalscoring threat that Rasmus Hojlund struggled to achieve last season, then United can reap the rewards.",
      "Hojlund has hit the ground running since departing United for Napoli but he managed just four goals for the Reds in the Premier League last season. If Amorim's men are to compete at the top end of the table, they will need a regular supply of goals from their centre forward.",
      "Sesko's early signs of fulfilling that brief are promising, and Amorim has been pleased with what he has seen from the 22-year-old.",
      "\"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game,\" he said. \"That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "The hard work will continue at Anfield on Sunday, Amorim will hope it yields a result.",

      "After coming to terms with the decision to leave the club he had been associated with since 2004, Pedro looked destined to move to Old Trafford. However, the now 38-year-old has shed light on why the deal fell through.",
      "\"I don’t know what happened behind the scenes, the deal with United was almost done,\" Pedro explained. \"They took too long to decide, the season was about to start, and I didn’t want to wait any longer.",
      "\"I even played the UEFA Super Cup with Barca, where I scored the winning goal. There was uncertainty and anxiety.",
      "\"PSG were also interested in me, then Chelsea’s interest came in. Cesc Fabregas acted as an intermediary, [Jose] Mourinho called me and said they were willing to offer more, so we contacted United to explain the situation, but they didn’t make a clear decision and I chose to go to Chelsea.\"",
      "Louis van Gaal was the manager of United at this time and would last just one more year before being sacked following the FA Cup win over Crystal Palace in 2016. As for Pedro, he would spend five years at Stamford Bridge, scoring 43 goals and bagging 26 assists in 206 appearances for the club.",

Salford starting to wear red coincided with a consortium consisting of former Manchester United players Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Ryan Giggs taking over the then non-league club alongside Singapore-based billionaire Peter Lim.",

The pair front a new ownership group that also includes businessman Declan Kelly and former banker Lord Mervyn Davies.",

      "The club also state that \"significant work to be undertaken at the Peninsula Stadium to update cladding and seats, among other infrastructure upgrades that are already due to take place\" before next season begins.",
      "They add that \"this landmark choice will evolve the Club into a bold, new era by combining our tangerine heritage with modern style to create a striking orange identity\".

      "Not for the first time, a Manchester United player has left Old Trafford and has managed to rediscover his form away from the pressures of the Premier League.",
      "The latest player to enjoy that new lease of life is Rasmus Hojlund, who has excelled during the international break for Denmark. In 2024, Hojlund did not score a single goal for the Danish national team.",
      "He bagged his first for the Dane's since October 2023 in March and his form has rocketed since leaving United. He has bagged four goals and an assist for his nation this term to add to the four in six games he has managed for Napoli since leaving United for Serie A.",
      "Such form has led to his international manager Brian Riemer to suggest why he feels Hojlund is benefitting from his new surroundings. \"The fact that he is now on a well-functioning team and has players around him who take pride in doing good for others helps to make the outcome for a striker like Rasmus, who needs to be serviced,\" Riemer told TipsBladet.",
      "Now, his assessment is not altogether wrong. At times last season, it seemed as though the Reds were just a team of individuals and Hojlund was effectively living off scraps.",
      "There was no sense of cohesion and sacrificing the Premier League to focus on the Europa League didn't help with that and backfired spectacularly. However, giving United some credit, there are three stars who are starting to prove Riemer's theory wrong.",
      "Following the victory over Sunderland, both Altay Bayindir and Matheus Cunha showed signs that this set of players are working towards a collective goal. Both men were dropped for the fixture against the Black Cats and yet, neither man took to social media to cheap point score or sulked at the final whistle.",
      "Instead they congratulated the likes of Senne Lammens and Mason Mount who took their places in the team and celebrated the three points as strongly as if they were on the pitch for 90 minutes. And this is the sort of atmosphere which Ruben Amorim is trying to foster, and what could have helped Hojlund if he was granted the opportunity to stay.",
      "There of course needs to be a fundamental competitiveness within the squad but United are not going to get anywhere without a semblance of team spirit. The Reds have even shown this to be the case by adapting their play slightly to accommodate Benjamin Sesko.",
      "His goal against Sunderland came thanks to a Diogo Dalot long throw into the box. That sort of service would have been a dream for Hojlund last season and wasn't there.",
      "Riemer's comments were valid when assessing the United of last season. But this campaign, Amorim is clearly trying to change that and three Reds are leading the way with this new philosophy.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

    "body": [
      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "As the stagger unwinds across various continents’ World Cup qualifying competitions, we’re starting to get a clearer idea about which countries – and thus which star players – might somehow still be in danger of missing out on a tournament almost everyone (well, 48 countries) now qualifies for.",
      "Fair to say the peril for these guys still ranges from ‘mild’ to ‘extreme’ to ‘confirmed’ and there’s plenty still to keep an eye on across the next international breaks in November and March.",
      "You can check out how World Cup qualifying for the new expanded 48-team tournament works here, because in lots of places it’s now very different to how it was before.",
      "In particular, as you’ll see, there are some huge names from European countries particularly grateful for the whopping great safety net that’s in place for teams who won their most recent Nations League group – at whatever level.",
      "",
      "Let the always entertaining and in no way boring Liverpool-Arsenal arguments begin over who is better out of Isak and Viktor Gyokeres. And then row in, mischief blazing, and insist the answer is in fact Dejan Kulusevski, actually.",
      "But the main point here is that right now all of them are at serious risk of missing the World Cup, with Sweden already looking mighty relieved to have that Nations League-based safety net to get them into the play-offs because they sit forlornly right at the very bottom of their qualifying group at the halfway stage, nine whole points behind perennial qualifiers Switzerland and six behind second-placed Kosovo.",
      "",
      "Having cited ‘mental tiredness’ as he made himself unavailable for June’s international break, Poland’s talisman was replaced as captain by coach Michal Probierz. Lewandowski’s response was to say that he would not play for Poland again until the coach was sacked.",
      "A damaging 2-1 defeat to Finland on the back of the Lewandowki spat meant that by the time the September internationals came along, Probierz was gone and Lewandowski was back for an impressive 1-1 draw in Holland secured by Matty Cash’s late equaliser.",
      "A 3-1 return win over Finland means fears of missing out altogether have now eased, but even a win over Netherlands in the next international break is unlikely to save them from what will be tricky play-off routes in which 16 entrants of assorted quality are whittled down to four qualifiers.",
      "",
      "Getting battered by a ridiculously talented Norway side has cost manager Luciano Spalletti his job but it could also help cost Italy a place at the World Cup, and that includes the new Manchester City goalkeeper.",
      "Already looks like it’s play-offs at best for a team trailing that Haaland-powered Norway machine by six points with three games to play.",
      "",
      "Having gone up another level following his move to PSG and swift treble glory inside six months, Kvaratskhelia is now well established among the very best players in the world.",
      "But he still faces an uphill struggle to qualify for a World Cup with Georgia, having to come through what is the toughest and most competitive qualification region and also the one to benefit the least from the expansion to 48 teams.",
      "Georgia currently trail Spain and Turkey in Group E and must finish in the top two to have any chance.",
      "",
      "Interesting times for the centre-back, dealing with the Angeball whirlwind at club level and now injured and unable to help his Serbia team-mates avoid a 1-0 defeat to Latvia that has left their top-two chances in England’s group looking bleak.",
      "And there’s no Nations League helping hand here either.",
      "",
      "Even with Africa being one of the big winners from the World Cup’s expansion, a couple of traditional big names have got themselves in bother.",
      "Cameroon look set to miss out on qualification to Cape Verde in African Group D, and will then be relying on being one of the four best runners-up from the nine groups just to reach the play-offs. And if they win the play-offs it only gets them to… another play-off – the intercontinental ones that will decide the final two qualifiers in March.",
      "Plenty of familiar names in the Cameroon squad, but Manchester United’s big summer signing from Brentford would be the biggest.",
      "",
      "Out of favour at Tottenham and out of the World Cup after Mali could finish only third in their qualifying group behind Ghana and Madagascar.",
      "And to make matters worse, he left the field on a stretcher during Mali’s final game of the campaign after suffering a nasty-looking ankle injury.",
      "",
      "Another African country with plenty of World Cup pedigree that appear set to miss out is Nigeria. Galatasaray striker and Liverpool mini-crisis contributor Osimhen is perhaps the biggest global star from a squad that has underperformed badly to trail Benin and South Africa with just one match to go to try and salvage the situation, but he is far from alone. Alex Iwobi, Wilfrid Ndidi, Ademola Lookman, Ola Aina and Kelechi Iheanacho have all been involved.",
      "Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres will somehow return to Liverpool and Arsenal with less confidence than they left with. Kosovo, lads? Really?",
      "Arsenal legend Jack Wilshere has been named Luton Town’s new manager and he’s one of eight young bosses making everyone feel incredibly old…",
      "Nottingham Forest have engineered a scenario whereby Sean Dyche is a good Ange Postecoglou replacement through some absurd Evangelos Marinakis self-sabotage.",
      "It’s a very slow day in the Mailbox but a man’s AITA Reddit-style question from Sunday has had a vociferous response.",
      "Manchester United are being linked with a ‘shock’ £60m Manchester United transfer that’s no ‘shock’ at all.",

      "Matheus Cunha believes the combination of signing for Manchester United in the summer and playing for Brazil represents a “spectacular personal moment”, and that’s just one of the worrying admissions he made while on international duty.",
      "Cunha joined United for £62.5m in the summer on the back of 15 goals and six assists in an outstanding 2024/2025 season for Wolves. But he’s yet to score or assist in seven games for his new club and was dropped to the bench by Ruben Amorim for the 2-0 win over Sunderland last time, with his replacement, Mason Mount, scoring and impressing in his stead.",
      "The Brazilian will be well aware of the number of quality players who have been signed by United for similarly hefty fees and failed to live up to expectations, and appears to already be feeling the stress.",
      "After leading the Selecao line in their 5-0 win over South Korea on Friday, Cunha admitted it feels as though he’s been at United for far longer than a couple of months amid his and his teammates’ struggle to pick up the positive results required to keep Ruben Amorim in the job.",
      "“I try as much as possible to adapt, to learn… it’s only been two months,” he said. “But it feels like I’ve been here for a long time because of the club’s current situation.”",

      "But perhaps most worrying of all, and this has been a criticism aimed at innumerable United stars for over a decade since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, is Cunha’s belief that he has ‘arrived’.",
      "“We live in a constant search for something. Even though a difficult moment when you’re pursuing a dream and encountering some obstacles leaves you feeling a bit lost,” he added.",
      "“You want to understand, and despite having so much, you don’t feel fulfilled by what you’ve achieved.",
      "“You have to constantly remember where you came from to understand where you’ve arrived.",
      "“What I was searching for as a person more than anything else, I’m slowly finding. You constantly want to improve. That’s innate in human nature, but I can’t help but stop and enjoy this moment.",
      "“Feeling privileged to wear the jersey of the greatest national team in the world, one of the greatest clubs in the world… it’s a spectacular personal moment.",
      "“I have an incredible family, another little girl now, everyone is doing well and feeling healthy. I’m enjoying all of this in a positive way.”",
      "All too many players have seen United as an end-game; the point at which they’ve ‘completed football’. And while that was previously because it was the club where trophies were won, it’s more recently been the location to accumulate wealth while resting on laurels.",

      "In 15 damning words, a rejuvenated Marcus Rashford summed up the reason for his and almost all others’ inability to maintain peak performance levels at Manchester United, and why Sir Jim Ratcliffe is clinging to the increasingly false hope of Ruben Amorim turning things around at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford now has eight goal contributions in nine games for club and country, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has described him as an “unbelievable” talent and president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck. The £26m required to make his loan move permanent at the end of the season looks like an absurd bargain.",
      "But we’ve been here before with Rashford. After 43 goals and 22 assists across two seasons under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he was being linked with £100m moves abroad. 30 goals in all competitions under Erik ten Hag in 2022/2023 saw United hand him a very lucrative five-year contract to ward away the same eager suitors. But troughs have followed those peaks.",
      "Rashford scored just five goals in Solskjaer’s third season and eight in Ten Hag’s second. Suggestions of complacency, overconfidence and distraction have all been aimed at Rashford by people who don’t and can’t know why he’s never been able to sustain the top level required to be labelled a world class footballer. But Rashford himself has perfectly sound justification for his own inconsistency.",
      "“I feel like I have been in an inconsistent environment for a very long time,” he said.",
      "The 27-year-old had been asked by ITV ahead of England’s World Cup qualifier against Latvia on Tuesday what he thought about Thomas Tuchel’s claim that the only thing preventing Rashford from being considered a truly elite footballer was his lack of consistency.",
      "“But I completely agree,” Rashford added. “I think consistency is what I need to bring into my game and I am looking to do that. I want to be at my best, not sometimes, but as often as possible.",
      "“When people talk about consistency, in order to be consistent in anything not just sport, you need consistent variables in your life and the way you train.",
      "“We have just had so many changes so far in my career but I have to look forward and that it definitely one of the things I want to put right and improve on to be at my best more often.",
      "“When I am at my best I really enjoy everything about the sport.”",
      "Ten games for Barcelona is evidently too small a sample size to make any grand claims over Rashford’s consistency, but his comments do speak to the predicament Ratcliffe and Ineos now find themselves in with regards to Amorim’s future at the club.",
      "Whether he will be given this time or – as we suspect – not, Ratcliffe said last week that Amorim needs “three years” at United to prove he’s a “great coach”. And while that felt like an almost farcical vote of confidence in a manager who’s overseen their worst Premier League season ever and has accrued just 37 points in 34 top flight games, the quest for consistency goes a long way to explaining it.",
      "Because having just one player – Bruno Fernandes – you could reasonably pick out as being a consistently good footballer in over a decade isn’t normal, not just for a club like Manchester United, but any football club.",
      "It’s far too simplistic to suggest that the chopping and changing of managers is solely to blame – other top clubs with a similar approach don’t suffer in the same way – and blindly sticking with the latest recruit just because they happen to be in charge when this dawning realisation occurs could be catastrophic.",
      "But it makes sense that Ratcliffe, in a bid to build a team of consistent footballers, is desperate to avoid the inconsistencies that Rashford, and doubtless others who have either left Manchester United or remain in the midst of the madness, see as the cause of their struggle to remain at the pinnacle once it’s been reached at Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona ‘will trigger’ their option to sign Marcus Rashford permanently from Manchester United next summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already decided whether to give FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford a ‘surprise lifetime’.",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta can’t believe his luck in landing Marcus Rashford from Man Utd over the summer, according to reports.",
      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",

      "Gary Neville has been put forward as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim as Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes was reportedly ‘consulted’ over the current situation.",
      "The Red Devils have had a nightmare time under Amorim with the Portuguese head coach managing to accumulate just 37 points from 34 Premier League matches since taking over from Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "There were rumours that Amorim could face the sack if he’d lost to Sunderland heavily before the international break with Man Utd sitting in the bottom half.",
      "A report from the Daily Mirror has claimed that members of the Red Devils hierarchy ‘held talks with senior players to discuss the current situation at the club’.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox led ‘recent discussions between the club’s hierarchy and the playing squad’ as they attempted to gauge the mood within the camp.",
      "READ: Man Utd and the ‘shock’ £60m transfer exclusive that’s nothing of the sort…",
      "The report adds: ‘Captain Bruno Fernandes is among those who have been consulted, while other opinions have also been sought. It has been suggested the conversations were casual in nature and not necessarily designed to evaluate Amorim’s standing at the club as such.",
      "‘Nevertheless, it is not the sort of activity one would normally witness at a club where everything is functioning seamlessly.’",
      "If Man Utd do end up sacking Amorim this season, former Red Devils defender Neville has been tipped to replace the Portuguese boss by his former Valencia striker Alvaro Negredo.",
      "Negredo, who played under Neville in the Man Utd legend’s only managerial job, told Coin Poker: “It also depends on the situation at Manchester United. I think he was a very important player for Manchester United. He’s a player who gave a lot to English football.",
      "“Perhaps, similar to Valencia at that time, it’s a United team who haven’t been consistently at the top for a long time, and perhaps now wouldn’t be the best moment.”",
      "Michael Owen thinks it’s “embarrassing” to suggest that all of the Red Devils’ problems under Amorim are over the Man Utd boss playing three at the back.",
      "Owen said recently: “They’re playing a back-three. If I’m not wrong, I watched Erik Ten Hag about a year ago playing a back-four, and it was some of the most awful football I’ve ever seen from a Manchester United team.",
      "“Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I’m not saying that’s my favourite formation at all, and I’m not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation.",
      "“But I certainly don’t think all of United’s problems now are because they play with the back-three.",
      "“It’s embarrassing if you’re going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three. I mean, it really isn’t.",
      "“They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.”",
      "READ NEXT: Man United, Liverpool and Arsenal stars in danger of missing out on expanded 48-team World Cup",

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Man Utd’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps him in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes feels a meeting with Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is a good opportunity to “settle scores” after he missed a penalty against him earlier this season.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘too big to succeed with the 2025 media landscape making it impossible for any manager to escape the ‘relentless and cacophonous’ noise."

      "Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann got it wrong when he said that Florian Wirtz had created the most chances in the Premier League, but there are numbers that suggest he has been the Reds’ most creative player this season.",
      "Nagelsmann attempted to blame Wirtz’s Liverpool teammates for his 007 start but was quoting the wrong statistics; he has actually created the joint-15th-most chances in the Premier League this season, which is not quite so impressive.",
      "But when you look at the statistics for shot-creating actions this season, Wirtz is joint-seventh on the list and ahead of every other Liverpool attacker, including Mo Salah in 80th.",
      "According to Opta, they are the two offensive actions directly leading to a shot, such as passes, take-ons and drawing fouls.",
      "For fairness, we look at SCAs per 90, so that players are not rewarded for just playing all of the football like Bruno Fernandes and Elliot Anderson. Though to be fair, they do not need any help.",
      "So the top 10 creative players in the Premier League by the fairest metric are…",
      "",
      "10) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): 4.33 SCAs per 90\nHaving a bloody lovely time at the right size club and thriving in that No. 10 role with Iliman Ndiaye and Jack Grealish either side. If Everton had a halfway competent striker, they would be flying.",
      "",
      "9) Kieran Trippier (Newcastle United): 4.40 SCAs per 90\nPretty much takes all the set-pieces, putting him behind only Granit Xhaka in terms of SCAs from dead balls this season. But he’s also creating chances from open play, none of which have been taken by a blunt Newcastle attack so far.",
      "",
      "7=) Oscar Bobb (Manchester City): 4.48 SCAs per 90\nWhen you play on the same team as Erling Haaland, you are going to log some serious chances. Bobb may not be a guaranteed starter in this Manchester City team but he is making a serious case for his involvement, notching six SCAs v Brentford in their last fixture before the international break.",
      "",
      "7=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool): 4.48 SCAs per 90\nThere he is. Not the highest chance-creator in the Premier League, but up there when it comes to involvement in Liverpool moves leading to shots on goal. There were eight such SCAs on his truly competitive debut against Bournemouth but you’re only as good as your last game…and that was poor v Chelsea.",
      "",
      "6) Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest): 4.57 SCAs per 90\nHe’s played himself into the England team as a more defensive option but he is Forest’s most creative player this season, which is likely to make him the subject of serious transfer interest (most notably from Manchester United) in 2026. He was involved in all three Forest goals on the opening day of the season, before things went a bit mental.",
      "",
      "5) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal): 4.68 SCAs per 90\nEasing himself back into serious form and back into the England starting XI this season. The next Arsenal player on the list would be Noni Madueke in 22nd, which suggests that Mikel Arteta might have to find a way to get them both in the side.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish (Everton): 4.86 SCAs per 90\nEverton have scored nine Premier League goals this season; Grealish was involved in the build-up of six and scored one more. He is having a bloody lovely time on Merseyside. Again, imagine if Everton had a proper striker.",
      "",
      "3) Amad Diallo (Manchester United): 5.03 SCAs per 90\nInvolved in both Manchester United goals v Sunderland, Amad is one good reason why the club may still be clinging onto the idea that this formation would work under this manager.",
      "",
      "2) Jeremy Doku (Manchester City): 6.03 SCAs per 90\n“I ask the wingers in the final third to go one vs. one or one vs. two and I have the feeling that Jeremy’s decision-making in the final third improved, like, wow!”. Like wow indeed.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): 6.18 SCAs per 90\nNone of it has really come off as yet, but the idea that playing deeper is stymying his creativity is clearly a nonsense. Nobody creates more from open play in the Premier League; he was particularly brilliant against Arsenal on the opening day.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is lying and so too is Jack Grealish, whose snub can only be explained by some sort of ‘personal’ rift between the two…",
      "Gary Neville has been put forward as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim as Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes was ‘consulted’ over the current situation.",
      "Florian Wirtz’s record of seven Premier League games for Liverpool without a goal or assist has been defended by Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann using false statistics.",
      "Transfer insider Graeme Bailey has revealed that Manchester United have “held talks” over the sale of Bruno Fernandes, as “things have changed” after a summer move fell through.",
      "Legendary former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has weighed in on the struggles of Florian Wirtz at the moment, revealing what “everyone knows” about the situation.",

      "“I mean, if Manchester United want Adam Wharton, that’s nothing surprising really. The fact of the matter is he’s got a long contract to run. There’s no pressure on us to do it and I don’t think there’s any real pressure from the player either.”",
      "The other supposed ‘blow’ for Man Utd is that Parish and Glasner have held talks over a new contract.",

      "“Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that. He’s in football for those days where we give all that pleasure to the fans. And we do as well.",
      "“So, if we can align those interests, then hopefully we can make something happen.”",

      "Joey Barton has hit out at Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney over his “conspiracy theories” around Man City’s dramatic Premier League title win in 2012.",
      "The Red Devils were beaten to the Premier League title on the final day of the 2012 season despite their 1-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Man City were losing 2-1 at home to relegation-threatened QPR going into second-half stoppage time before Roberto Mancini’s side scored two goals in two minutes and five seconds to take the victory and the title.",
      "Wayne Rooney has since voiced skepticism around Sergio Aguero’s late winner, while he criticised QPR’s players for “celebrating after the game with the City players”.",
      "Djibril Cisse hit back at those accusations from Rooney last week and insisted it was understandable that he celebrated with compatriot Samir Nasri as both teams had achieved something with QPR staying up.",
      "Cisse told FourFourTwo: “I’m not going to take this accusation any longer. I was celebrating with Samir Nasri.",
      "READ: England fans not behaving like insane headbangers is a plus, Tommy Tuchel",
      "“I didn’t celebrate with Mario Balotelli, Sergio Aguero or anybody else. I celebrated with my brother, Samir, who had been a friend of mine for 15 years.",
      "“I was happy for my friend and also that we managed to stay up. I don’t care about Man City. My friend finally won the Premier League after many years in England and I was happy for him and also for me. That’s all.”",
      "Barton, who made a fool out of himself after being sent off, got involved in the debate after Cisse’s comments, he began: “There’s been a bit of a spat online between Djibril Cisse and Wayne Rooney. Rooney has said that the game was bent and that QPR threw that game.”",
      "On Man Utd legend Rooney, Barton added: “I’m only commenting on it because he referenced me in it. Half of our team knew we were safe and stayed up and half of our team didn’t. You can see when you see it.",
      "“Five or six of the team did. I can hear it getting shouted from the sidelines. We had all been in City’s academy. You had Nedum Onuoha, Shaun Wright-Phillips and myself. So we would have wanted Manchester City to win the league over Man United, make no bones about that.",
      "“But at the time, we were fighting for our own survival, so we had to better other people’s results on that day to stay up. As it was, we all got beat.",
      "“I have to disagree with Wayne. Wayne is trying to say that this game is some kind of bent fixture, that the lads had given up. He does say Paddy Kenny has basically thrown the two goals in that lead to City winning the league. I don’t think Paddy knew.",
      "“You might say Paddy should have done better with the goals, but I don’t think Paddy Kenny is the type of lad to throw a game to help Man City win the league.”",
      "READ: Florian Wirtz defended with nonsense statistic from Nagelsmann blaming Liverpool teammates",
      "He then ramped up the expletives, Barton continued: “So Wayne, and the other Man United fans – and I know loads of Man United fans have come up and asked me – no. I got told by Bobby Zamora to get someone sent off, so I tried. That’s where the book stops with me.",
      "“Your conspiracy theories, Wazza, are untrue. Sometimes people tell you stuff in life and you want to believe it because it fits your narrative and you want to have that cognitive dissonance.",
      "“It might be the same fellas who were saying that if you get one more hair transplant it might come back. This might be the time you get a fringe. As you found out, that is complete nonsense.",
      "“Stop wasting your time on nonsense. The game at Man City was not thrown. Man City won the league, Man United never. Am I happy about that? Abso-f***ing-lutely, because I hate Man United. But I didn’t go out my way to make City win the league.",
      "READ: Man Utd officials ‘meeting’ UAE-based consortium today in London with Glazers ‘open’ to sale",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b****cks.",
      "“You should have got yourselves in a better position. You didn’t. Man City had to beat QPR on the last day of the season at home, who were in the bottom four. That’s your fault.",
      "“The fact he’s even had a sniff of winning the league is a testament to the lads at QPR and the battle they put up, because that was an easy f***ing win for City.”",
      "Barton finished by adding: “QPR stayed up, happy days. City won the league, happy days. And you ****s were all crying on the pitch at the f***ing Stadium of f***ing Light or Middlesborough or wherever you was, which is f***ing triple whammy. Get f***ed.”",

      "“People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "“If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them.",

      "“He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.”",
      "Waddle’s suggestion that Semenyo could play in attack with Cunha and Sesko would mean there was no space for Mbeumo, and that would be a surprise given he’s had more impact than Cunha so far this term.",
      "It is conceivable that Semenyo would leave Bournemouth for United, as Cunha and Mbeumo were both at similar stature teams – Brentford finished above United last season – but still joined them.",
      "But he’ll have seen that neither is having the same impact there, and for a player with six goals and three assists in seven Premier League games this season, he won’t want to risk becoming less impactful by making a move to the wrong side.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has confirmed why Viktor Gyokeres did not move to Manchester United in the summer, after his agent revealed Sporting CP tried to sell the Arsenal man there.",
      "Gyokeres was one of the main strikers courted by a lot of clubs in the summer. He came off the back of a 54-goal season with Sporting as one of the most in-demand forwards in the world.",
      "He was linked with a lot of Europe’s biggest clubs at one time or another, but in the end it boiled down to two options: United or Arsenal.",
      "The Swede ended up at the Emirates, where he has scored three goals so far, but it has been revealed just how close he came to a United move, as a result of a push from Sporting.",
      "Gyokeres’ agent recently said: “Sporting had concluded a deal with Manchester United behind our backs, that was a problem. United offered a higher transfer fee.”",
      "That has been confirmed by transfer insider Romano, who revealed why the Red Devils lost out.",
      "He said on YouTube: “The crazy story around Gyokeres [his agent] says behind our back, Sporting concluded a deal for Viktor Gyokeres with Manchester United while we had an agreement with Arsenal.",
      "“Man Utd closed the deal with Sporting, and that’s the reality.",
      "“At some point, Sporting were insisting and pushing to offer Viktor Gyokeres to Man United and to get the deal done for less money than Arsenal with Manchester United in terms of fixed fee, but with better bonuses.",
      "“United were ready to make the deal, but the problem then was always the player, Viktor Gyokeres with all respect for Man United, wanted to go to Arsenal and made very clear that his desire was to go to Arsenal.",
      "“Sporting were pushing like crazy, there were three or four days where Sporting tried in every way to close the deal for Gyokeres to Man United.",
      "“Gyokeres decided to wait, to resist, to be patient and then to join Arsenal as he wanted to do.”",
      "That United couldn’t get Gyokeres meant they landed Benjamin Sesko, who has so far scored twice in seven Premier League games.",
      "Gyokeres has scored three in seven for Arsenal, so at the moment, there is little to split the two high-value summer striker signings.",
      "Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres will somehow return to Liverpool and Arsenal with less confidence than they left with. Kosovo, lads? Really?",
      "Even with a whopping 48 teams taking part in the World Cup, there are still some of the best players in the world at risk of missing out.",
      "Arsenal have been warned that one player could cost them the Premier League title this season, while Mikel Arteta “can’t” get them “over the line”.",
      "A report has revealed how the injury to Kai Havertz has meant Premier League sides are scared of two aspects of another Arsenal attacker’s game, in turn giving Bukayo Saka ...",
      "A representative of Viktor Gyokeres has revealed how close Manchester United came to signing the Arsenal star in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims that Liverpool are “on their knees” after a couple of losses, as he describe one summer signing as doing “alright.”"

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps the Manchester United manager in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham – even that they managed to make a pig’s ear of – and replaced by sack-race winner Nuno Espirito Santo, who will duly return somewhere in the middle of the pack here in due course.",
      "We can only assume that Potter will therefore replace Postecoglou, Nuno’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground as the Aussie is the favourite to be binned next, replacing Amorim, who is probably only still in a job so United can save a few quid on his pay-off.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Although what does need saying here is that there is a wild divergence in opinion on Slot’s job security. He is – entirely absurdly – joint third-favourite in some places. But we’re interested in the best available prices, and on that basis he’s as safe as Mikel Arteta.",
      "But however ridiculous it may sound, there are bookmakers out there who consider Slot’s position to be less secure than anyone in the league who isn’t Ange Postecoglou or Ruben Amorim.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward but the increasing body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",
      "Postecoglou is the first Forest manager in a hundred years – an actual century – to go winless in his first six matches in charge. And it’s now seven after defeat at Newcastle.",
      "It helps not that he replaced a popular figure but the shadow of Nuno would be no inconvenience if Forest weren’t shipping goals for fun while showcasing all the flaws associated with Angeball. Fifteen goals conceded, seven from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",
      "What Postecoglou needs is a patient owner willing to wait for an undefinable period in the forlorn hope the new manager’s messages might eventually land. He’s got Evangelos Marinakis. Mate.",

      "A Serie A giant chief has reportedly drawn up an ‘intriguing idea’ to land a Manchester United attacker who is said to be ‘deeply frustrated’ at the moment.",
      "United’s attack left a lot to be desired last season. In the Premier League, none of their players surpassed 10 goals, and central strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored four and three goals respectively, though both played north of 30 games.",
      "Over the summer, it was reported that United were looking to ship out Hojlund, though Zirkzee would be safe. That was despite the former wanting to stay at United.",
      "He was indeed shipped out, to Napoli, but while Zirkzee survived, things have not panned out how they might have.",
      "The Dutchman has played just 82 minutes in all competitions this term, with new signing Benjamin Sesko preferred up top of late, while Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have also been given minutes there.",
      "Amid his struggles for playing time, Gazzetta dello Sport reports Dan Friedkin and Gian Piero Gasperini at Roma have come up with the ‘intriguing idea’ of loaning Zirkzee in.",
      "The report states that the Dutchman ‘wants to leave’ in order to avoid the risk of missing out on the World Cup, having been left out of the Netherlands side of late.",
      "The report suggests that within the Premier League, West Ham and Everton also have Zirkzee in their sights.",
      "A recent report stated that Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Juventus and Como are looking at the United man, with the Hammers also mentioned.",
      "That, too, suggested that Zirkzee is not happy with his role at United. Indeed, it was said that he is ‘deeply frustrated’ by his current role, and a January move will be crucial if he’s to play in the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Ronald Koeman’s recent comments are a stark reminder of that.",
      "The Netherlands boss said: “He wasn’t in the preliminary selection because I don’t think he’s good enough at the moment.",
      "“Especially scanning when turning or passing often goes wrong. Yes, in principle form and fitness are always leading, but that is not always possible.",
      "“We have a lot of central defenders and midfielders, but we are somewhat limited up front.",

      "",
      "Thanks George for asking in the last mailbox. It’s been stressing me out a lot hearing how 3-5-2 doesn’t work for various reasons and Amorim and the players have no chance.",
      "I remember in the 90s when Roy Evans took over the Liverpool side and adopted a 3-5-2. Liverpool bought Mark Wright for £2.2m who was England’s centre back (Harry Maguire with pace and class). John Scales (De Ligt with fewer mistakes) and Phil Babb (Lenny Yoro) were the other centre backs.",
      "Left back was Stig Inge Bjornabye and Steve Harkness. Nothing world class but could tirelessly get up and down the whole game. Right back was Rob Jones who was superb and again could run and run. Dorgu seems like he knows what he is doing but neither Dalot or Amad are a good fit for that position which messes up the formation and attacking lines.",
      "Midfield we had John Barnes (Bruno Fernandes) but he was fat and old so he just sat at the back reading the game, intercepting, spraying lovely passes and getting a few goals. He was definitely not all over the pitch trying to do everything but falling on all counts and ruining the formation. Barnes also took a decent penalty without getting into a strop. His partner was a young Jamie Redknapp whose best achievement was marrying Louise (If you know you know). He was a decent player and put a shift in. The 2 of them screened the back 3 so we were pretty solid.",
      "Biggest difference in Utd and Liverpool was the front 3. Liverpool had Steve McManaman who was all over the pitch (where Bruno should play) and had the license to roam and create. Up front was Stanley Victor Collymore and Robbie Fowler. They got 55 goals between them one season and played as orthodox strikers. The team was built to get chances to the front 2.",
      "In my opinion (Geoff) with Cunha roaming and Mbeumo wide it only leaves Sesko in there who can be easily marshalled by the opposition defence. So the answer is simple. Bruno needs to be further forward with Cunha and Mbeumo as 2 orthodox strikers. Put De Ligt as defensive midfield with Mason Mount sitting in front of the back 3. Buy a right wing back. It’s not hard, we can all see it, which is why it’s strange that Amorim cannot.\nHong Kong Ian (#Amorimin) LFC",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes feels a meeting with Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is a good opportunity to “settle scores” after he missed a penalty against him earlier this season.",
      "Fernandes has been one of United‘s very best players since he joined them in 2020. The attacking midfielder has been directly involved in 186 goals in 298 games for the Red Devils.",
      "He has been their designated penalty taker for most of his time there, and in the Premier League, he’s scored 23 of those spot kicks, and missed six.",
      "But this season, Fernandes’ record from the spot is pretty woeful, as he’s scored just one of three efforts.",
      "He scored against Burnley, skied one against Fulham and saw Brentford goalkeeper Kelleher save his attempt in a 3-1 loss.",
      "Fernandes will come up against Kelleher for Portugal against Ireland on Saturday, and thus his penalty record has been brought up.",
      "Fernandes said: “This season, out of three, I ended up missing two. I don’t want to miss any of them. It’s something I need to study better. I’ll always do it with full conviction because there’s a coach who trusts me.",
      "“Every day is a good day to settle scores.",
      "“He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn’t. But it’s not something that affects my head. In a football team, there’s something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.”",
      "Portugal have full points from their two World Cup qualification games so far, but Fernandes is yet to have a direct hand in a goal.",
      "He played 90 minutes in the 5-0 victory over Armenia and neither scored nor assisted, before he again blanked in a 66-minute outing against Hungary.",
      "In three games against Ireland in his career, he’s assisted once and not scored.",
      "But the midfielder’s assist came in his last outing against Ireland, so he’ll be hoping not only that he can put his woes against Kelleher behind him, but that he can carry the form from his last match against them with him.",
      "Fernandes has also revealed that he has no immediate plans to move away from United.",
      "He said: “I didn’t close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup.",
      "“That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That’s all there is to it.”",
      "Gary Neville has been put forward as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim as Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes was ‘consulted’ over the current situation.",

      "Bruno Fernandes insists leaving Man Utd for Saudi Arabia is an “impossible scenario to imagine” but admits he’s “no idea if there’s any truth” to the links.",

Does Mr Bowler believe that every flag, once erected, must stay up forever? Would they not get fairly tatty?",
      "This flag, in particular, was on some scaffolding on a building site owned by Gary Neville. Does this mean the scaffolding has to stay up on the property until the end of time, long after the construction is concluded, for fear of disturbing the precious flag that has been tied to it?

It’s just a bit of fabric with some colours on; it is a symbol, and as with every symbol its meaning comes from how it’s used and who by. What it represents can change at the drop of a (Bowler) hat. 30 years ago, if I’d started tying flags to lampposts showing the colours of the rainbow, most people would have assumed I was in favour of leprechauns, or Teletubbies, or Zippy and Bungle, etc. What’s that idiot doing up a ladder with that flag? He must really like Dark Side of the Moon to go to all that effort.",

Nobody saw Noel Gallagher playing a UJ guitar at the height of Britpop and thought, this is bad, it’s obviously jackboots next. Were we all watching Mo Farah, Jess E-H, Greg Rutherford wearing flags round their shoulders during their 2012 victory laps and screeching, will no-one rid me of these turbulent racists? I tell you what, that Roger Moore skiing off a cliff and opening a Union Jack parachute? Disgusting.",

Yes, most people realised something was very amiss at that point. Obviously, a lot of us – myself included – didn’t want to see it in his case, and quite merrily ignored the Asian Ruts and the Pregnant for the Last Times; but eventually you have to see what’s in front of your face. If Reform councillors get elected and immediately take down Pride flags – symbols of, more than anything else, a plea for tolerance and acceptance – whatever goes up in their place can only represent intolerance and exclusion. And what did they put up? The Gammon Bat Signal itself.",

Look up the word ‘literally’ in the dictionary to see that these things can get complicated. So, you can pretend the meaning of the flag isn’t changing, and you’re not changing it. Life may be easier psychologically if you tell yourself that the flag doesn’t mean anything deep; there’s no subtext to anything; flying the UJ is just a plain statement of fact – it’s just reminding people what country they’re in. On a par with tying a flag to a lamppost that says, this is a lamppost. What are people annoyed about? Nobody gets ‘triggered’ when they see place names on a road sign do they? What’s all the fuss about?",
      "But whether you know it or not, it’s reflecting you and your personality. It’s reflecting your actions in public and how you speak about the world. And if that flag is a big piece of cloth with your face on it, then fine – you get to own that, nobody else is involved. But if you’re telling everyone that this is their flag too, their country, and their values, the answer is No. Nobody asked us to sign up to how this is being used; nobody tying flags to railings and then pissing in the street straight afterwards asked for my opinion beforehand; nobody setting hotels on fire stopped to enquire if the people – be they white, middle-aged, angry or whatever else – are alright with this.",

      "Top Man Utd target Carlos Baleba will ask to leave Premier League side Brighton in the January transfer window, according to the latest reports.",
      "The Red Devils continue to struggle for consistency in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side winning three, losing three and drawing one of their first seven league matches this term.",
      "Amorim has managed to earn just 37 points from his first 34 Premier League matches and there are clear areas of his squad which still need addressing.",
      "Man Utd spent around £200m on their attack over the summer transfer window with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all arriving, while new goalkeeper Senne Lammens made his debut in their last match against Sunderland, which they won 2-0.",
      "Midfield is still a big concern amongst fans, with Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro failing to convince, and they were heavily linked to Baleba in the summer transfer window.",
      "Man Utd were initially put off by Brighton’s huge demands for the Cameroon international with rumours that they want around £115m for the defensive midfielder.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim has three weeks, not three years, to prove himself to Ratcliffe",
      "However, the Red Devils are still keeping tabs on him ahead of a potential move in the future with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insisting Man Utd could sign a midfielder in January.",
      "Romano said recently: “There’s a possibility of Man United going for a midfielder in January, but it depends on opportunities. Unless there is a big name it is likely to be a window of a loan deal or last minute chance on the market.”",
      "And now an account on X, which was credited by The Athletic’s David Ornstein for initially breaking Man Utd’s initial interest in Baleba, has another update.",
      "The account wrote: ‘Exclusive. Carlos Baleba will request to leave Brighton in January. Baleba’s agent to meet @OfficialBHAFC in November.’",
      "‘But the club are continuing work on the market looking ahead to next summer, which will likely be an important window for them given several players are out of contract as it stands, such as Harry Maguire and Casemiro.",
      "‘There is a realistic prospect that Brazilian Casemiro will not see his contract renewed, freeing up space on the wage bill and therefore presenting United with an opportunity to strengthen in that area of the field.",
      "‘United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front.",
      "‘United have long been admirers of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba – but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",

      "READ: Newcastle strike agreement which could give them advantage over Man Utd after £193.7m defeats",
      "Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke recently insisted that Man Utd “would love the opportunity” to sign Baleba over the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "O’Rourke said: “His price tag’s only going to go up because of how he’s performing for Brighton.",
      "“He’s a top player, Baleba, but he’s under contract until 2028, so Brighton are in no rush to cash in on him and have no intention of selling him.",
      "“They were never going to sell him in the summer transfer window, and Man United’s interest never got as far as offers or bids being made.",
      "“Baleba is on United’s radar because they’re missing that type of player in midfield, and from what I know, if Brighton are to sell him, they’ll be looking for top dollar.",
      "“There’s no guarantee his price tag will drop, and I expect it could even rise if he enjoys another stellar season for Brighton this year.",
      "“Man United would love the opportunity to sign Baleba, but they’ll have to get past Brighton first, and they’ve shown that won’t be easy.”",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes and Manchester United have already ‘agreed’ his £100m ‘sale’ and this deal will fund two ‘incoming’ signings.",
      "Carlos Baleba’s failed summer move to Manchester United has left no winners, with the Brighton star one of this season’s biggest disappointments…",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" he told The Business podcast, produced by The Times and The Sunday Times.",

      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",
      "\"So a lot of what we have done in the first year is spend an awful lot of time putting the club on a sustainable, healthy footing.",
      "\"We're not seeing all the benefits of the restructuring that we've done in this set of (financial) results (United last month reported record revenues of £666.5million for last season but a loss of £33million for the financial year) and we were not in the Champions League.",
      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",
      "Ratcliffe says he wants to give his first managerial appointment at Old Trafford three years to prove himself as a \"great coach\" and that patience extends to the players.",

If you actually look at the quotes, he's not coming out and saying come what may, Ruben Amorim is not leaving. He will be the head coach for the next three years.",

      "Gary Neville thinks Ruben Amorim is \"not off the hook\" despite Manchester United's important 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "\"It was a must-win game and I don't think it lets him off the hook,\" Neville said on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"There's too many defeats, the record's too poor so I don't think anybody will be celebrating too much tonight at Manchester United but I think they'll be relieved that there is a victory which allows a little bit of peace going into the international break.",
      "\"Manchester United win the odd game but that's nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"",
      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
      "That view was put to Neville, who hit back.",
      "He said: \"If pundits are getting into your head then you shouldn't be playing for the club.",
      "\"Do people not remember Alan Hanson criticising us when we broke in as young kids saying that you can't win anything with kids. That was the greatest centre-back of all time at that moment talking about us as if we were, you know, inferior and nowhere near good enough.",
      "\"Did they not think that we got criticised during our football careers. I'm sorry you're playing for Manchester United - it comes with the territory, you've got to step up.",
      "\"They've been hopeless in the system. If it's not the system, then the players are a problem, the manager is a problem, the whole thing's a problem if you're losing football matches to the level that they've been doing.",
      "\"I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches and I played in a dressing room that when you lost football matches you came in and you said sorry. There was accountability. Why would you blame other people. I've not got any time for excuse mentality shortcuts blaming other people - it's the worst thing that you can do in life.",
      "\"I think they just need to concentrate on doing their jobs and doing it well and winning football matches. The only thing that's going to shut anybody up is winning football matches and they've not won anywhere near enough.\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
