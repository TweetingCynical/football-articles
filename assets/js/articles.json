      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that he thrust Manchester United starlet Chido Obi into the first-team picture too soon last season. The Red Devils' boss does not believe that his side were capable of helping the teenager as they suffered adversity.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and struggled to find three points after Amorim was appointed a year ago. As the Portuguese coach looked for answers to help turn around the club's form, Obi was afforded a number of opportunities.",
      "The Danish forward was signed from Premier League rivals Arsenal and hit the ground running in the youth ranks, bagging 12 goals in 10 outings for the under-18s. He also fired in six goals in 16 appearances for the under-21s.",
      "That saw Obi earn first-team recognition as he made eight appearances under Amorim. The striker has not appeared since the final day of last season against Fulham, however.",
      "Amorim believes he did not foster the correct environment for Obi to thrive last term. “He played last year, but I think it was too soon,\" he said.",
      "“We didn’t have a team we could put a young kid of 16 into and him not struggle.",
      "“He’s one of the guys but he started too soon. Sometimes it’s hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that ‘I’m already here’. We need to be careful with that.”",
      "Obi's youth team-mate Shea Lacey is said to be in contention for a first-team role. United are anticipating relying on their academy when losing players to AFCON later this year.",
      "Lacey could be named in United's squad to face Everton. The attacker has three goals and two assists for the under-21s this season",
      "Amorim has been impressed with what he's seen so far., although the Portuguese coach was cautious in his assessment of the 18-year-old.",
      "He said: “I’m really happy with him. He has a lot of talent but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard.",
      "“In Premier League games the pressure is harder, so they need to be ready.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Iqbal will miss the upcoming Europa League match against Real Betis, with boss Ron Jans unhappy with the player's dedication in training before the international break. The 22-year-old picked up his 22nd cap for Iraq after making two appearances against the United Arab Emirates as his nation progressed in World Cup qualifying.",
      "The midfielder has made five Eredivisie appearances and two outings in the Europa League this season. Iqbal has not convinced Jans of his determination, however, according to reports in the Netherlands.",
      "Iqbal joined Utrecht from Manchester United in the summer of 2023. The Dutch side paid a fee of £1million for his services.",
      "The Utrecht player spent 11 years at United and became the first British South Asian to represent Manchester United. Iqbal was eligible to represent England, Pakistan and Iraq before plumping for the latter.",
      "The Manchester-born star made his first-team debut in December 2021 in the Champions League against Young Boys, under Ralf Rangnick. Iqbal's progress stalled under Erik ten Hag, however.",
      "The prospect was once subject to a foul-mouthed outburst from manager Ten Hag after being singled out during a training session by the Dutchman. The United boss was filmed screaming: \"Keep the ball on the floor... Zidane! Hey! Keep the ball! F***ing rubbish!\"",
      "Iqbal does not believe he was offered a fair chance by Ten Hag. That saw him look for a move away.",
      "Speaking to The National, Iqbal said: “I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "“I spoke to my dad and agent and said: ‘I can’t do this for another year’. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team.",
      "\"For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the under-23s. I thought to myself, ‘I’m just like a number’.”",
      "Iqbal made 18 appearances for Utrecht last term after making 17 Eredivisie outings in his debut season with the club. It appears the international has more work to do to leave his mark on the team.",

      "Both will be keen to have more playing time to stand a chance of representing their nations in the World Cup next summer. They will need more time on the pitch to earn a call-up for the Netherlands and England for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.",

      "However, Ruben Amorim's side will have to face the challenge without some crucial squad members as injury woes start to plague the Theatre of Dreams. The Red Devils are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, with three victories and two consecutive draws, the latter two games showcasing dramatic performances that secured them a point each.",
      "A victory at Old Trafford by three or more goals could catapult United into the top four, but even a simple win would suffice to keep the heat on those occupying the Champions League spots. Summer recruit Matheus Cunha has become an injury concern for United after he was absent from a Christmas lights switch-on event at the weekend.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" VisitAltrincham announced in a statement.",
      "Whether he'll make an appearance against Everton is still up in the air, though ESPN has reported that Cunha's 'minor knock' could still see him fit enough to play.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko is set to continue his spell on the side-lines due to injury. The Slovenian was forced off during the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur due to a knee injury.",
      "Rumours have surfaced suggesting that Sesko could be out of action for up to a month due to the injury.",
      "Speaking about Sesko's situation, Amorim said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long but it is not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover.",
      "\"He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back. I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don't want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire will also be absent for the Toffees' trip to Old Trafford. The England defender sustained a muscle injury during United's draw with Tottenham before the international break.",
      "Amorim confirmed that Maguire is \"not ready\" to feature against Everton on Monday night, and it remains to be seen when the England international will make his return to the squad. Kobbie Mainoo is in a race against the clock to be fit for the Everton clash.",
      "The midfielder missed the draw with Tottenham before the international break after picking up a knock. The 20-year-old will need to demonstrate his fitness if he is to feature in the squad.",
      "Amorim also confirmed that Mainoo had not yet returned to training as of Friday, though he remained hopeful the midfielder would be back involved ahead of the Everton fixture. He said: \"Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez remains on the road to recovery as he continues his rehabilitation from the knee injury he sustained in February. The problem was serious enough to require surgery for the Argentine, who has since been gradually building up his fitness levels ahead of his return to the starting XI.",
      "Amorim indicated recently that he expects to have the Argentina international back in action in the coming weeks. He said: \"He needs more time to work there, and he is not working there, but in an emergency, he can play, but I am not thinking about that.",
      "\"I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.\"",
      "As for Everton, former United transfer target Jarrad Branthwaite is unavailable, as is fellow defender Nathan Patterson. Merlin Rohl is also expected to be absent after undergoing surgery during the international break.",

      "After months of progress at Barcelona, Marcus Rashford was dealt a rough hand this week. That's after the Manchester United loanee was forced to watch from the sidelines as the rest of his team-mates in Catalonia made history.",
      "Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim is hard at work preparing for a January transfer window that could be transformative for the club. The Red Devils are finally on the rise this season, and much of that has been down to the squad improvements made in the summer.",
      "Saturday marked a special day in Barcelona's calendar after the club finally made its return to the renovated Camp Nou after two years away. The Blaugrana battered Athletic Club 4-0 in the first fixture to be played at the remodelled stadium, but Rashford was nowhere to be seen.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford will miss today's match against Athletic Club due to flu,\" read an official club statement. And the news excluded Rashford from being part of the historic unveiling of Barca's new-and-improved venue.",
      "Rashford had previously communicated his ambitions to play in the upgraded Camp Nou once it was open for business. Speaking at an open training session earlier in November, he said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I can't wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The silver lining is Rashford will still get his chance to be a part of Barca's line-up when they welcome their first capacity crowd at the Camp Nou. Saturday's game was played in front of a crowd of only around 45,000, with some renovation work still ongoing.",
      "When the work is complete and the stadium is fully up and running, it's expected to house up to around 105,000 fans. And given Rashford's impact under Hansi Flick so far this season, one would imagine he'll be one of the first names on the team sheet provided he's fit when that occasion comes around.",
      "One target being touted for a move to Old Trafford of late is Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi. However, United's chances of landing the German have taken a knock after it was reported he'd prefer to join Arsenal instead.",
      "Despite a complete overhaul of their attacking line-up in the summer, the Red Devils are being linked with more forward reinforcements in 2026. And Adeyemi looks like a realistic target after it emerged talks over a new Dortmund deal are understood to have stalled.",
      "The 23-year-old winger's current contract runs until the summer of 2027, meaning Dortmund will be expected to accept a lower fee for his services. However, that hasn't prevented reports suggesting the Black and Yellows want £75million for their man, which is believed to be more than United are willing to pay.",
      "That could give Arsenal the opening they need to swoop in should they decide they see more value in his signature. On the plus side, United share a largely positive relationship with Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes, who has helped execute the signings of clients like Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte in recent years.",
      "The supposed £75m price-tag becomes that much more difficult to justify considering Adeyemi has fallen somewhat out of favour under Niko Kovac. The attacker was an automatic starter for much of the first half of this season but has been benched for their last three Bundesliga games, scoring just four times in 15 games across all competitions this term.",

      "As the dust settles on Sunday afternoon’s north London derby against Tottenham, Arsenal turn their focus towards a busy week. There will be no respite for Mikel Arteta or his players as the Premier League leaders take on Bayern Munich next in Wednesday’s Champions League fixture.",
      "That will be followed by a crucial league visit to Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Gunners manager and sporting director Andrea Berta will have one eye on the transfer market, with just over a month left until the January window opens.",
      "We now take a look at two news stories that have emerged in the past few days which might determine how the north Londoners act in the coming transfer windows.",
      "Arsenal’s desire to upgrade in the left wing position in the summer was no secret. Antoine Semenyo’s incredible form over the past two seasons, along with his openness about being an Arsenal fan, has seen the Gunners linked with the Bournemouth sensation in recent months.",
      "But it is highly unlikely that Arsenal will pull off a transfer for the Ghanaian, who is said to have a £65million release clause in his contract. Although the Gunners remain compliant with PSR rules, they are believed to be sailing close to the wind where UEFA Squad Cost rules are concerned after their record-breaking summer spending spree.",
      "It is therefore understood that, barring any major sale on their part, January is set to be a quiet month in terms of transfer business in N5. That’s especially the case given that Arteta’s side have made a strong start to the season, with an abundance of depth at the Spaniard’s disposal.",
      "Should Semenyo stay at the Vitality Stadium until the end of the campaign, when his release clause will decrease, Arsenal could change their position, particularly if Gabriel Martinelli is offloaded. But the 25-year-old Bournemouth star is already being linked with several rivals, including Liverpool and Tottenham, which means bringing him to the Emirates Stadium could be a huge challenge.",
      "Another player Arteta is known to be a big fan of is Juventus’ Kenan Yildiz. Berta has been keeping track of the Turkey international’s situation in Turin, although that is standard practice rather than a major development.",
      "Yildiz, capable of playing as a left winger or as a central attacking midfielder, is still in contract talks with Juventus over a potential pay-rise, with the Serie A giants believing the 20-year-old deserves a more lucrative pay package.",
      "Yet, their negotiations are still ongoing after several months, with a positive outcome yet to be reached. Juve’s sporting director Giorgio Chiellini has maintained that the club are relaxed about the situation, with Yildiz being under contract until June 2029.",
      "Sources close to Yildiz have confirmed there has been informal contact from a number of Premier League clubs in the past six months to gain an understanding of the Turk's situation. But, even if Juventus are unable to agree a new deal with the player, the ex-Bayern Munich youth sensation is expected to command a premium fee.",
      "Manchester United were among the clubs considering a move for Yildiz earlier this year, before eventually signing Matheus Cunha in the summer. Chelsea and Real Madrid could also compete with Arsenal for his signature given their interest in the player.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have NOT made an approach for Joao Gomes, according to Wolves boss Rob Edwards. The Brazilian features on the Red Devils’ shortlist as they target an overhaul of their midfield under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He features alongside Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher of Atletico Madrid. With the transfer window just over a month away, United are expected to ramp up their efforts of signing a new midfielder soon.",
      "But as it stands, the Red Devils are yet to make an official approach to Wolves over Gomes. Speaking ahead of his side’s 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace, boss Edwards said: \"We've spoken about stuff but my focus has been on getting the team organised.",
      "“We have got some good players and there will always be interest, but I'm not aware of anything. Joao has been excellent this week.\"",
      "One man who would be a big fan of Gomes moving to Old Trafford is his former Wolves teammate Matheus Cunha. The forward has compared Gomes to current Red Devils star Casemiro amid glowing praise.",
      "He said: \"He is a bit older now but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive. I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch. I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Gomes, 24, joined Wolves from Brazilian side Flamengo in 2023 and he has gone on to make 104 appearances for the side since then, scoring seven goals. He only signed a new deal with Wolves earlier this year, that contract set to run until 2030, but it is thought that an offer in the region of around £44m might be enough to facilitate an exit.",
      "Gomes remains far from the only option for United in their task to sign a new midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Anderson is a priority target - albeit his £100m price tag could present the Red Devils with a significant issue.",
      "Speaking about potential interest in his star midfielder, Forest boss Dyche said: “It is nothing to do with me, it is the powers that be. They run the club and the financial side. I’m sure they will ask my opinion about the situation, if it is needed - not just about him but about all the players here.”",

      "Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of Matheus Cunha after the forward picked up an injury in training on Saturday. United face Everton on Monday in the Premier League and are already a forward down, with Benjamin Sesko on the sidelines - and now Cunha is a doubt.",
      "The Brazilian forward had been set for a key role in the match at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim likely to field him as a false No.9 in the absence of Sesko. But news of a possible injury blow arrived via an unusual source on Saturday.",
      "Cunha had been due to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening. But the 26-year-old ending up pulling out of the ceremonial role in the town, prompting a statement.",
      "VisitAltrincham wrote on social media: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "That news worried United fans, who already knew their side had been without Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo in Friday's training session. But ESPN reports that Cunha has only picked up a 'minor knock', which sounds a lot less worrying than 'accident'.",
      "Nevertheless, Cunha remains a doubt for the Everton match and will be assessed in the run-up to the 8pm kick-off on Monday. He has managed just one goal in 11 appearances for United so far this season following his £62.5million transfer from Wolves in the summer.",
      "Despite his lack of goals, the Brazil international has been a key player for Amorim in attack, blending well with fellow new arrival Bryan Mbeumo. His importance for Monday's game was increased by the news that Sesko had not shaken off the injury he picked up in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham before the international break.",
      "\"He is going to be a few weeks out,\" Amorim said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Not that serious, we have to be careful. He is feeling better.\"",
      "Amorim said Mainoo would be assessed in Saturday's training session, but Maguire was ruled out of Monday's game. \"Maguire is not ready,\" Amorim said. \"Kobbie didn’t train today but I think we could see Kobbie tomorrow so we’ll see.”",
      "He added: \"There is an opportunity for other players like the under-21s. We will see it is not ideal. They are so important in our team.\"",

      "Manchester United could offer Antoine Semenyo his preferred No. 24 shirt in a bid to lure the Bournemouth forward to Old Trafford in January. The Red Devils are reportedly looking to sign the Ghana international from the south coast this winter and hold a potential edge over other suitors being touted.",
      "Semenyo, 25, has netted six goals and provided three assists in just 11 Premier League matches this season. He is increasingly linked with a mid-season move to the Red Devils as a result and knowing his usual jersey is on offer could play a role in negotiations.",
      "The No. 24 shirt is currently occupied by goalkeeper Andre Onana, who is on loan at Trabzonspor until the end of the season. But United may not have any qualms about making it available for Semenyo.",
      "This subtle gesture could prove crucial in their pursuit of one of the most sought-after players in the Premier League right now. Onana's future at United looks bleak after a series of blunders tarnished his reputation and the success of Senne Lammens has only made his position more precarious.",
      "The summer recruit from Royal Antwerp has proved to be a steal in United colours thus far. So much so that Onana, who cost £43.4million when he reunited with former Ajax chief Erik ten Hag in 2023, already seems redundant.",
      "Semenyo's availability in January has sparked a lot of chatter after it was revealed the player has a £65m release clause in his Bournemouth contract. The winger signed fresh terms on the south coast over the summer but it's understood he only penned the new contract with the understanding the Cherries would include a release clause.",
      "That's enough to suggest Semenyo, who has previously hinted his preference would be to join Arsenal, would be willing to move if the right opportunity presents itself. And the £65m figure presents a fairly realistic price for the biggest spenders in England's top flight.",
      "Nonetheless, there are perhaps still concerns as to whether United could afford such a splurge midway through the campaign. Ruben Amorim's side recruited Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko for a combined fee of around £200m, leaving some question as to where Semenyo would even fit into the XI without dropping one of those players.",
      "That being said, Semenyo has showcased his versatility in just about any attacking role, including the No. 10 position. One solution could see him take that slot off Bruno Fernandes' hands and drop the Portugal talisman into a deeper midfield role.",
      "However, United fans might be disheartened to discover they aren't as highly regarded in the race for Semenyo's signature as others. The Athletic has reported Liverpool and Manchester City are leading the chase for his signature, with both teams likely more enticing to most players at present.",
      "United could also offer Semenyo the No. 9 jersey should they desire. The number has been left vacant after Rasmus Hojlund left to join Napoli on loan over the summer.",
      "While it may seem fairly minimal in the grand scheme of things, having the right shirt number is of major importance to certain star talents. It just so happens Liverpool would also be able to offer the No. 24, though Josko Gvardiol currently wears that jersey for City.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane insists he never meant to cause serious harm to Alf-Inge Haaland with that infamous challenge more than two decades ago. The rivalry between Keane and Haaland started when the ex-Manchester United star ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament during a match against Leeds United in 1997.",
      "Haaland controversially stood over the Irishman and claimed the midfielder was feigning injury. Reflecting on the incident, the former striker said: \"He tried to tackle me and I got the free kick.",
      "\"He was lying on the ground, and I just told him to, 'Get up' as you normally do with players - nothing more than that. I wasn't trying to intend anything against him, but obviously, he took that very hard.\"",
      "This ignited a rage within Keane, who encountered Haaland four years later during a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, with the Norwegian playing for City. Seizing his moment for revenge, Keane went in on Haaland.",
      "He was dismissed for stamping on his knee with considerable force, something he acknowledged wasn't accidental in his 2002 autobiography. He said: \"I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that, you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.\"",
      "Keane was handed a three-match ban and a £5,000 fine initially, but this was extended once he confessed to deliberate intent in his book. An additional £150,000 fine and a five-match suspension were imposed.",
      "The 54-year-old remains unapologetic about his infamous tackle on Haaland, insisting he never intended to cause serious harm. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, he said: \"This is my last time talking about this tackle, the Haaland one.",
      "\"I still don't think it was a bad tackle, I really don't. I don't care what anyone says. It's not as bad as everyone thinks it is. When you play sport at that speed we played at, there's a difference between hurting somebody and injuring somebody - big difference. That's my argument. I was trying to hurt him, not injure somebody.\"",
      "Haaland, who retired in 2003 due to an injury on the leg opposite to the one Keane targeted, has a different perspective. In 2024, he said: \"Is that a coincidence, or isn't it? If you're in the ground and someone hits you in the right leg, you can still twist your other leg. It can get injured and that's probably what happened.",
      "\"I haven't played a full 90 minutes after that incident, that's the hard fact. And people can judge whatever they want. Obviously, I found out afterwards that it was with intent and he was seeking revenge and all these things. I think that's a bit sad. Sad for football and it was not good for me either at the time.\"",
      "Keane maintains that Haaland turned out for his country just four days following the clash and subsequently featured for City. He said: \"Haaland finished the game and played four days later, for Norway.",
      "\"A couple of years later, he tried to claim that he'd had to retire because of the tackle. He was going to sue me. It was a bad tackle but he was still able to play four days later.\"",

      "Manchester United are getting ready to return to action following the final international break of 2025. The Red Devils host Everton on Monday night, aiming to build on the mini-revival that has eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Brighton, United were slightly frustrated with draws away to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. However, following such a troubled start to the season, there are signs that Amorim’s expensive squad is beginning to gel.",
      "Amorim has been left pleasantly surprised by one of his summer signings. The goalkeeper position has been a problem area for United since the departure of David de Gea, with his replacement, Andre Onana, making a string of costly blunders.",
      "Altay Bayındır was given a chance at the start of the season but failed to impress, while Onana was shipped off to Trabzonspor on loan and looks unlikely to play for the club again.",
      "As a result, United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. While it is still early days, the 23-year-old has impressed with some assured performances. Amorim has been delighted to see Lammens look so confident so early in his United career.",
      "He told Stadium Astro: “Of course, we do our diligence when we are going to buy players.",
      "“It was a surprise. All the pressure that we suffer with the goalkeeper position, to arrive here and to show that confidence. To transmit that confidence to the team, I think, was a little bit of a surprise for me.",
      "“I’m not going to say everyone, but I’m talking as a manager. I have no problem to say that was a surprise for me.”",
      "Club legend Bryan Robson wants to see United strengthen their midfield with another player like Casemiro. Having mainly signed attack players in the summer, the middle of the pitch will be an area of focus for Amorim ahead of the January window.",
      "Former Real Madrid star Casemiro, 33, has come in for criticism in recent seasons amid claims that the Brazilian is past his best. But Robson says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves and would like to see another player of his ilk arrive this winter.",
      "Robson told Sportsboom: “People say he’s not this or he’s not that, his legs have gone. Not for me, Casemiro is still a fantastic player, and he would be on my team sheet every time. I think we’d benefit from another Casemiro-like midfielder, that would definitely help us.”",
      "Robson also believes Kobbie Mainoo could still have a future at the club, despite his lack of game time under Amorim. The former Middlesbrough boss added: “I think the future is bright, the club has some great young players.",
      "“I still think there’s a lot more to come from some of these young players, just look at Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“He had so many injuries last year, it really was a stop-start season for him, but you look at the year before and he was outstanding for the last six months of the season. There’s a lot more to come from Mainoo and the other young lads.”",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has finally made his eagerly-anticipated debut for Monaco, though he was thrust into a nightmare situation with his team trailing 4-0. Pogba hadn't featured in competitive action for two years following a four-year doping suspension that was subsequently cut to 18 months on appeal.",
      "Following 811 days on the sidelines, Pogba can once again consider himself an active player after a brief yet undoubtedly fulfilling 10-minute appearance on Saturday night. Sadly, Monaco were being demolished 4-0 by Rennes when Pogba entered the fray.",
      "Former Arsenal forward Mika Biereth pulled one back deep into stoppage time but strikes from Abdelhamid Ait Boudlal, Mahdi Camara, Breel Embolo and Ludovic Bias had placed Rennes firmly in the driving seat.",
      "Regarding Pogba's performance, he registered 17 touches and completed 14 passes from 15 attempts. In defensive terms, he recorded two ball recoveries and one interception.",
      "The world champion has now revealed his emotions on playing again after being absent for more than two years due to his suspension and subsequent fitness issues.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, as reported by RMC Sport, Pogba said: \"I was disappointed to lose this match. It's Paul Pogba's return, but I play for Monaco, and I don't like losing. I was really happy on one hand, but on the other, I was disappointed with the result and what we did on the pitch.",
      "\"It touched me, the reception. Seeing the crowd stand up and applaud, I wasn't expecting that. A big thank you to the fans who personally supported me.",
      "\"The feeling was good, I wanted to bring good energy, not concede a goal, enjoy myself, it's been a long time. I'm relieved to be back playing football, what I love most in the world. There's still work to do to get back to full fitness.\"",
      "Monaco boss Sebastien Pocognoli had teased a potential comeback for Pogba during his pre-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"We have a session today [Friday] so we'll see. If it goes well, he can be there. He has had a run of sessions, and the feedback is positive. He has been able to test himself in match conditions. There are good signs.\"",
      "It wouldn't have been the comeback to football Pogba would have probably been envisioning, but simply being back playing the game he adores will have almost certainly felt like a monumentally important milestone.",
      "Pogba will now be hoping to step up his involvement over the forthcoming weeks and also feature in the Champions League for the first time in more than three-and-a-half years.",
      "Monaco face Cypriot outfit Pafos next Tuesday as they aim to build upon the five points already secured from four fixtures. Pogba's team then take on defending Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain that weekend.",
      "After signing for the French side as a free agent in June 2025, Pogba was given a tailored training plan to get him match fit. His return was expected against Paris FC earlier this month, but a minor injury put his comeback on hold.",

      "Scott Minto believes that Liverpool should avoid signing Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window and go all-in for Marc Guehi. Arne Slot has struggled to find his stride in the Premier League this season, with the heart of Liverpool's defence proving particularly problematic.",
      "The side have shipped 20 goals thus far, with their previously impenetrable defence of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate looking far weaker in 2025/26 for one reason or another. Elsewhere, summer signing Milos Kerkez has suffered teething problems since his £40million switch from Bournemouth this summer, while Jeremie Frimpong has been plagued by hamstring injury.",
      "As a result of the latter's issues, the Reds have been forced to utilise the likes of Dominik Szoboszlai as a makeshift right-back to compensate. The club have also been hampered by an inability to create and put away chances this term, despite major acquisitions in the form of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak.",
      "And while some may be quick to point the finger of blame at Slot's strike force as the catalyst of their qualms this term, others have highlighted how the back line may need further investment when the transfer window re-opens. Speaking on talkSPORT this week, Sam Matterface asked Minto and Alex Crook why they would be tempted to splurge on Crystal Palace skipper Guehi in January, given he will be available as a free agent in the summer.",
      "To which, Minto replied: \"Because questions are being asked now. Are they even going to finish in the top four? But lets see, he’s not just a short-term fix, he’s an £80million footballer.",
      "\"He's an £80million pound footballer that they could have got for £35million but for things going on elsewhere, and if they had put down £40m, £45m they probably would have got him straight away. And yet what do we think the problems are with Liverpool right now?\"",
      "Crook then added: \"I don't think Liverpool are in any kind of financial situation because they went for a couple of transfer windows didn't they? Didn't spend anything, and actually you look at their net spend which is what I was talking about…Their net spend in this summer transfer window was £218million pound less than Arsenal so I think they have got the funds.\"",
      "To which, Minto explained: \"So I would I would bring in Marc Guehi rather than Antoine Semenyo,\" before Crook asked: \"Because Van Dijk and Konate have been vulnerable?” The former Chelsea and West Ham star then replied: \"Absolutely.\"",
      "Liverpool chased Guehi's signature this summer in a deal which very nearly looked like going through until the eleventh hour. While Liverpool looked to have snagged a deadline day transfer for the England international to the tune of £35m, Palace eventually blocked the move as a result of struggling to find a replacement in time.",
      "Should Liverpool ditch their endeavours of signing Semenyo in favour of trying to strike a deal for Guehi, it would be fantastic news for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils were also linked with the Ghanaian over the course of the summer, before he ultimately committed his future to the Cherries in a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "However, it was recently reported that Bournemouth may be powerless in fending off interest from potential suitors in January, given Semenyo's contract is said to hold a £65m release clause which can be activated by any club. While United bolstered their attacking line with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, they could still seek further firepower as they look to qualify for European football for 2026/27.",
      "And given Semenyo's impressive haul of six goals from 11 games this season, they may opt to pick up where they left off in tailing the 25-year-old this summer when the January transfer window blows open.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gregor Kobel is currently Dortmund's highest paid star, on £150,000-a-week. And Sancho would have to fall into line with the club's wage structure, in order to seal a move back to the Bundesliga outfit.",
      "Sancho has seen his career turn into a nightmare since joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021. The winger failed to make an impact and ended up returning to Dortmund on-loan in 2024, following a public bust up with then United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "While back at Dortmund, he helped them reach the Champions League final. Sancho spent last season on-loan at Chelsea, who refused the option of making the move permanent last summer.",
      "Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, but has struggled for game time and made just four league appearances. He knows he needs to leave English football behind once again next summer, but it remains to be seen if he is willing to reduce his wage demands.",
      "Sancho can leave United on a free transfer in June when his contract expires, and will be able to negotiate signing on fee with a new club. He can start talking to interested clubs in January.",
      "The winger had a successful four-year stint with Dortmund between 2017 and 2021, netting 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games. It was by far the best period of his career, which was derailed by his £73million transfer to United in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has managed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, where he fell out with Erik ten Hag and was exiled by Ruben Amorim. Things haven't started well for him at Villa, either, with minutes hard to come by under Unai Emery.",
      "The Villa boss even embarrassed him by substituted Sancho on and off against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 minutes against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",

But of course, it is not ideal because they [Amad, Mazraoui and Mbeumo] are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad. But our Academy is for this moment, and we will be ready.\"",

      "For United, he made his U18 debut at a mere 15 years old and now regularly graces the pitch for the U21s. In terms of stepping into a £71million Mbeumo's shoes, the youngster offers speed and flair down the right wing.",
      "Lacey also has the ability to transition into an attacking midfield role, a trait that will undoubtedly delight Amorim. While he may not have Mbeumo's physicality, Lacey compensates with his nimbleness and technical skills, effortlessly breezing past defenders. He's also earned a reputation as a free-kick maestro at academy level.",
      "Mantato has been part of the United family since he was just nine years old. Now 18, he has proven his mettle in high-pressure situations, including scoring a last-gasp winner to defeat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup quarterfinals earlier this year.",
      "Born and bred in Manchester, Mantato can operate as either a forward or full-back. This adaptability fits perfectly into Amorim's strategy, which employs a back three and two offensive-minded full-backs who surge forward during counter-attacks.",
      "Much like £32.5m star Amad, Mantato is a skilled dribbler with blistering pace down the flank. These qualities, coupled with his versatility, make him a prime contender to fill the void left by Amad's temporary departure.",
      "Kamason became the first player from United's Emerging Talent Programme to secure a professional deal. Former U18 lead coach Adam Lawrence told The Athletic his position is \"predominantly as a full-back, but he likes to get forward and can affect the game higher up the pitch.\"",
      "This perfectly matches the type of full-back Amorim depends upon. Kamason possesses the ability to surge forward, skip past opponents and whip in threatening deliveries - qualities that would suit Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha perfectly.",
      "He has also demonstrated his capability to cope with the physical demands of defending whilst switching seamlessly between defensive and attacking phases, and could make the perfect replacement for a £17.6m Mazraoui.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has told Jamie Carragher he could be \"in trouble\" this season following his earlier Premier League predictions. The Manchester United legend was joined by the Liverpool icon for the latest episode of The Overlap this week, where the pair discussed their respective clubs and recent form in the top flight.",
      "When Carragher addressed Liverpool's defensive issues during their chat, he emphasised how Arne Slot must sign a centre-back in January. That gave Neville the chance to ask whether failing to do so would allow United to finish above their fierce rivals come the end of the campaign, with Carra less than impressed with the cheeky dig.",
      "He responded: \"I don't think so,\" before turning the ribbing back on Neville. He continued: \"You're desperate for that aren't you? He got ridiculed, didn't he, for his predictions? So, I'm well aware every week he's on the phone to people at Sky saying, 'Well, what did Cara say in the predictions? What what did they say?'\"",
      "Neville then dismissed Carragher's joke, responding: \"Well, my predictions, as we've established in the first day, Monday Night Football are more accurate than yours over time. But I actually think this season you're in a bit of trouble.\"",
      "In a lighthearted exchange, Carragher quipped: \"I'm going to lose my job or something because I got my predictions wrong?\" as the panel erupted in laughter. When Ian Wright asked what the pair were discussing, Neville explained: \"Well, he had Liverpool winning the league.",
      "\"I had United in the top four, didn't I? They could sneak into fifth. Do you reckon they could finish fifth? Get into the Champions League.\"",
      "It comes as Neville may have secured bragging rights over Carragher following Liverpool's disastrous performance against Nottingham Forest at Anfield on Saturday.",
      "Slot's team endured a crushing 3-0 defeat on home turf, with goals from Murillo, Nicolo Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White sealing the deal.",
      "Consequently, the Reds now find themselves positioned below Manchester United in the table, with the Red Devils also holding a match in hand as they're not scheduled to resume Premier League action until Monday night's clash with Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Just goal difference separates United and Liverpool, who occupy 10th and 11th place respectively at present, though Ruben Amorim will be eager to establish breathing space over Slot's squad when his side do battle with the Toffees next week.",
      "United and Liverpool have experienced contrasting fortunes from their last five matches, with United going into their game against Everton undefeated in their last five, courtesy of victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "On the other hand, Liverpool have only managed a single win from their last five Premier League outings, suffering defeats to United, Brentford, Manchester City and Forest. Their sole victory from the period comes in the form of a 2-0 win over Aston Villa.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "But it has now emerged that Cunha has suffered an accident on the training ground. The 26-year-old was due to switch on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening.",
      "However, VisitAltrincham announced that the player would no longer be attending due to 'medical reasons.' The organisation posted on Instagram: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",
      "Several key players missed the opening session of training, however, including Benjamin Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo - all of whom are nursing various injuries. The news comes as United aim to improve their Premier League position when they welcome a revitalised Toffees outfit under David Moyes' guidance on Monday.",
      "The Red Devils are heading into the match with an impressive unbeaten streak in their last five games, thanks to victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "Sesko suffered a knee injury during United's game against Spurs before the international break, and he's not expected to be back until December. Maguire also had to be substituted during the same match due to a hamstring problem, with Amorim confessing that he \"is not ready\" for the upcoming game.",
      "Mainoo, on the other hand, missed the Reds' match against Spurs entirely due to an injury, but there's a chance he could make an appearance at the Theatre of Dreams on Monday, depending on his recovery. In other news, Lisandro Martinez might finally make his much-anticipated return to Premier League action against the Toffees.",
      "The Argentinian defender has been out of action since February due to an ACL injury, but reports suggest he's close to regaining full fitness. The 27-year-old was back in full training ahead of the international break, but Amorim decided not to play him straight away.",
      "Despite not getting a call-up for his country, Martinez did join up with Argentina to train and continue his journey to full fitness during the break. Speaking about the chance of him playing on Monday evening, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing,\" - a comment that will surely delight United fans across the globe.",

      "Manchester United are bracing themselves for disappointment in their bid to sign Karim Adeyemi. United have been keeping close tabs on the Borussia Dortmund forward, in the hope of luring him to Old Trafford.",
      "Club bosses have sounded out Adeyemi's agent, Jorge Mendes, about the chances of striking a deal next summer. But United manager Ruben Amorim is preparing to turn his attentions elsewhere, in his attempts to land a new goalscorer.",
      "Dortmund have slapped a £75m price-tag on the German international, which is more than what United were willing to pay.",
      "And to make matters worse, Adeyemi has made it clear that if he leaves Dortmund ahead of next season, his preferred destination is Arsenal and not United.",
      "Adeyemi, 23, is under contract until 2027, but talks with Dortmund over a new deal have stalled, and he is willing to find a new club in the summer.",
      "Earlier this week, the forward issued a public apology after he was charged and fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons - a knuckleduster and a taser.",
      "He issued a public statement on his Instagram to address the situation: \"You have probably seen the headlines about me in the last few days. It is not easy for me to talk about this. At the beginning of 2024, out of carelessness and without really thinking about what I was doing, I ordered a so-called ‘mystery box’ on the internet.",
      "\"It contained items that are not permitted under weapons legislation. Many months later, the package was delivered and ended up unopened at the police station.",
      "\"Nevertheless, it was a huge mistake. One that I am very sorry about, that cost me dearly and that I deeply regret. I know that I am in the public eye and have a role model function. I did not live up to that.",
      "\"That is precisely why it hurts me all the more that I acted so recklessly. I have learned more from this than I can put into words. And I promise you that I will avoid such mistakes in the future. Thank you to everyone who still trusts and supports me.\"",
      "Dortmund manager Niko Kovac confirmed the player will receive no additional punishment from the club and would not stop him from being named in forthcoming squads. “It is no reason for me to ban him for the next few weeks,\" Kovac explained.",
      "\"I am not his father, but his coach. People should put things into proper perspective. Everything has now been said about it. The focus is clearly on the Bundesliga. He will get our full support for that.”",

      "But whilst the 8pm kick-off on Monday offers some advantages Amorim would always rather be in action at the weekend, largely so that it makes life easier for fans. He claimed that matches were \"a family moment\", but the late kick-off on Monday may hamper some fans.",
      "He told the club's website: \"You want to play at the weekend because of our fans. That is the main thing. I understand nowadays this is a business and we need to respect that also – the TV companies give us a lot of money to control that but I prefer to play at weekends because it’s a family moment. Old Trafford is always full, so it’s going to be a very good moment.”",

But the Portuguese boss is in the midst of his best unbeaten run since being appointed with United winning three and drawing two of their past five matches. That has got the fans feeling optimistic, which has made playing at Old Trafford easier.",

The ardent Manchester United supporter was unveiled as one of the 10 participants for the latest series of the ITV jungle show, following his rise to fame through online streaming.",
      "His breakthrough into mainstream media came after a standout performance in the Sidemen charity match, leading to his Soccer Aid debut at Old Trafford - just months before being selected for I'm a Celeb alongside his good mate and rapper Aitch. Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, was known for filming himself at United games, but one particular clip sparked a significant backlash.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the Baller League manager frequently shares videos of his adventures playing Sunday League football and managing his Winton Yanited team.",
      "During United's 3-0 victory over Everton in November 2023, Ginge recorded himself participating in the contentious 'Feed the Scousers' chant in the away end - a video that garnered millions of views. The chant, set to the melody of the Christmas charity single 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' by Band Aid in 1984, makes light of food poverty.",
      "Following an overwhelming negative response, Ginge, who was brought up on a council estate and raised by his mother and nan, issued a heartfelt apology on his social media platforms after discussing with his Liverpudlian friends and understanding the meaning of the chant.",
      "\"I've just seen the tweets that are going around about the chant I sang at the Everton game,\" he penned. \"I'm so sorry I sang that chant, I got caught up in the moment and didn't think about what it actually meant.",
      "\"I've been told by some of my scouse mates that it's mocking poverty, and I want to say I'm so sorry I sang it and if I offended you. I've come from that background, on a council estate and ate £1 microwave meals every night.",
      "\"I 100% sympathise with you and I'm sorry, I genuinely meant nothing by it, I just got caught up. I'm so disappointed to be honest and I understand the anger, 100% because it's wrong, I did not mean to do it at all.\"",
      "Sporting his signature red Lightning McQueen crocs, Ginge had viewers in stitches from the very first episode. In the episode, he triumphed in a challenge to secure a place in the 'luxury getaway car' alongside Aitch, Eddie Kadi and Jack Osbourne.",
      "The victorious foursome were treated to steak for dinner and luxury beds upon their arrival in camp. Ginge has been put forward for the very first bushtucker trial, with both he and Ruby Wax participating in the first eating challenge at 'The Divey' in an attempt to win meals for camp. If he is chosen to undertake a second consecutive trial, he will then be exempt from the next one due to a new rule introduced for this year's show.",
      "Angry Ginge is capturing the hearts of a new generation during his stint in I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, and his latest confession about being sober has even more people praising him.",
      "In the comments, someone wrote: \"I loved seeing the conversation around sobriety (as someone is over two years in) and how they were all so honest and open about it. Hopefully it makes a difference to someone younger than me!\"",
      "Another gushed: \"Angry Ginge is HUGE for the younger male demographic. He’s a fantastic role model and on a program that’s extremely popular. Both my daughters are in relationships with boys (18 & 20), and they are far too cool to watch this usually. However, both are LOCKED IN to watch Angry Ginge and defo agree with what you say\".",
      "And a third said: \"He's absolutely brilliant. My 14-year-old boy absolutely loves him. And has actually been watching I'm a Celeb with me. He barely comes out of his room normally. Ginge is an absolute sweetheart, so is Aitch, two great role models for young men and teenage boys\".",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Manuel Ugarte to improve in training sessions amid concerns about his performances for Manchester United this season. Ugarte got off to a mixed start in Manchester after his €50million (£42.3m) transfer, with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024.",
      "The midfielder was expected to improve after the appointment of Amorim. Ugarte played his best football under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, but he's been unable to reproduce those levels so far at Old Trafford. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions. Amorim was asked whether he was surprised by Ugarte's form and challenged him to improve. \"No, I understand. If, again.. you are here [Manchester] longer than me, and you can sense that a lot of very good players come here, and sometimes they struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And they are struggling, he is struggling in the moment. But it is our job to try to help our players, and again, everything can change. And you saw it five weeks ago, the environment was completely different.",
      "\"So I know that Ugarte is struggling in the moment and my job is trying to help him to feel as a player, like I felt when he was a Sporting player, for example. But it is a different world and he needs to adapt and he needs to improve, especially in training.\"",
      "There has been speculation around Ugarte's future. Amorim was ruthless last summer, deciding Rasmus Hojlund should leave after a disappointing campaign. Benjamin Sesko has been sidelined with a knee injury, but Amorim does not regret allowing Hojlund to join Napoli.",
      "\"Our thinking is that we need two strikers,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer players that make two positions, because sometimes in these clubs it's hard to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Imagine that Rasmus is here, and you say if Ben has an injury, you have more time to play. It's impossible to manage a dressing room like that, so that's why we need to improve the kids from academy.",
      "\"If you have an injury, that is the opportunity for them, and then to have players that can play in different positions, for us to manage the team in a better way.\"",
      "Sesko picked up his knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim mentioned Manchester United youngsters Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher when he was asked how the team would cope with losing key players to the Africa Cup of Nations. Lacey and Fletcher took part in first-team training at Carrington on Friday morning, suggesting they have a chance of being named in the matchday squad when Everton visit Old Trafford.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was ruled out of facing Tottenham before the international break due to a knock, which opened the door for Fletcher to come into the first-team squad in London. Fletcher’s inclusion continued United's 88-year record of naming an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Darren Fletcher's son has made progress since joining from Manchester City two years ago, and has acquitted himself well playing against senior opposition in the EFL Trophy and National League Cup. Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at a press conference on Friday. Speaking about losing players to AFCON, he said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",
      "Chido Obi made seven appearances in the Premier League last season, but the young striker has not been named in a senior squad so far this term. Obi has played for the Under-21s, developing away from the spotlight, and Amorim believes he was overexposed last term due to injuries.",
      "\"Yeah, of course, he played last year,\" Amorim said about whether Obi was someone who could step up. \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "Speaking about trusting young players, Amorim said: \"First of all, I'm not preparing the academy, they are preparing the academy, we are paying more attention to them, we are talking with them.",
      "\"Just that is so important for us, to change information about the players, what they need, how they behave, even to call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well, if you don't behave really well. This connection is really important, we are trying to do that, we are putting everything in place.",
      "\"Nutritionist for the academy starts now, in our club. That is something that should be basic, so all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job, so I have more times with them, with training.",
      "\"So I'm more confident with them, when we put these kids to play in Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think, so I think everyone in the academy, are doing a very good job in the moment.\"",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "\"They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "\"That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Obi must continue to work hard to earn first-team involvement. \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals,\" said Binnion.",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim could be forced to think outside of the box tonight as the Reds welcome Everton to Old Trafford. United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and after defeats for the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City this weekend, Amorim will be hopeful his side can close the gap on those at the top.",
      "If they are going to do that, they will need to manage without Benjamin Sesko. The centre-forward picked up a knee injury in the draw against Tottenham Hotspur and is out for a few weeks.",
      "Matheus Cunha could also be missing after he suffered a training ground knock. The Brazilian had been expected to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening but the organisers announced he had pulled out due to medical reasons.",
      "So with potentially two absentees in the forward line, we could see a new role for Bryan Mbeumo. The Cameroonian has played as a No.10 since moving to Old Trafford but in the potential absence of Cunha and Sesko, Amorim could be tempted to have Mbeumo leading the line for United.",
      "If this is the thinking, we can expect Mason Mount and Amad to play just behind him. Amad spent last season as the Reds' No.10 but has excelled in the right wing-back role this term.",
      "The Ivorian's main strength remains his ability to attack so reverting back to the No.10 role should be no hardship. Noussair Mazraoui remains a solid option to fill in while Amad is being utilised further up the pitch.",
      "On the left flank, it is a toss up between Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot. Dorgu was favoured in the draw at Spurs and we expect the same to happen again on Monday night.",
      "Dalot does not seem comfortable on the left and Dorgu is certainly the future in that role. The Dane impressed last week for his country and Amorim will hope he can utilise this form for United.",
      "United predicted XI vs Everton: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Mazraoui, Fernandes, Casemiro, Dorgu; Amad, Mount; Mbeumo",

      "Manchester United will welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night with the hope of pushing closer towards the European spots. After an awful start to the season, Ruben Amorim has overseen an impressive turnaround, and he picked up the manager of the month award for October after three wins on the bounce.",
      "United began November by drawing against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. The Reds salvaged a point against Spurs before the international break thanks to a headed added-time goal from Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "Everton have made an indifferent start to the campaign and are struggling to score goals, but they secured a 2-0 victory against Fulham at the Hill Dickinson Stadium before the international break. They have only won once away from home all season - at Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Regarding the team news, Benjamin Sesko has been ruled out with a knee injury and Harry Maguire appeared to be ruled out after missing training on Friday. Kobbie Mainoo was expected to take part in training on Saturday after missing the session the day before.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up...",
      "The biggest team news headline was the update on Sesko, who picked up a knee injury against Tottenham last weekend. Sesko started on the bench against Spurs, which means Amorim can pick the same attack if he likes, but it makes sense to drop Amad to right wing-back and play Mount.",
      "Amad looked better when he was moved to that role at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Mount created two chances when he came on from the bench in the second half.",
      "Dorgu was recalled to the starting team in London and scored for Denmark during the break. There isn't much between Dalot and Dorgu because they've both been unconvincing, but I'd give the latter the nod.",
      "Doubts surrounding the fitness of Matheus Cunha will have raised alarm bells for United heading into this one. The Reds still have a few options in attack and could choose not to risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Bryan Mbeumo as the false nine will be a new role for him at Old Trafford but it is a position he has played before. This would allow Amad and Mount to play behind him and not risk the Brazilian.",
      "Playing Dorgu at left wing-back seems the most likely choice. Dalot is not comfortable on the left and the Dane's performance during the international break was good.",

      "United have enjoyed a positive start to 2025/26, but there's work still to be done if they have any hope of qualifying for European football next term. Ruben Amorim's side slipped to 10th over the weekend, but could climb into the top four should they secure victory over Everton at Old Trafford on Monday evening.",
      "The Reds will certainly fancy their chances heading into the action, having not lost any of their last five games - thanks to wins over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. The Toffees, meanwhile, have done well under David Moyes this term, but they've not beaten the Reds at Old Trafford in over a decade.",
      "While Amorim looks towards a hectic Premier League period in the build-up to the New Year, he'll hope that the Old Trafford top brass will grant him additional funds in the January transfer window. Antoine Semenyo and Joao Gomes have recently been linked with moves, as has Real Madrid star, Vinicius Jr.",
      "The Reds will also need to factor in the departures of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who are all set to feature at the Africa Cup of Nations next month. The tournament gets underway until December 21, with the final taking place on January 18.",
      "Ruben Amorim did not rule out green-lighting exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window, but reiterated that Manchester United will \"come first.\"",
      "Mainoo has played 228 minutes in all competitions and has started just once - in the Carabao Cup. Zirkzee has not been given a single start and has played just 90 minutes across five substitute appearances. It's understood Mainoo has done everything he can to break into the team, even changing his private chef at home in an attempt to improve his game and working with private coaches during the international breaks, but his situation has not changed with the January window approaching.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, has been linked with a return to Italy in the winter window.",
      "Vinicius Jr has reportedly told Real Madrid that he doesn't want to renew hiw contract while his relationship with Xabi Alonso is so strained.",
      "The Athletic reports that the message was passed on by the forward to Florentino Perez last month. The Brazilian's contract currently runs until June 2027, but talks to extend the deal have been running since January, ultimately stalling as the two parties were unable to come to an agreement.",
      "It comes as Manchester United have found themselves linked with making a move for Vinicius Jr next summer, but could choose to strike in January instead, as a result of the recent report.",
      "Former Manchester United starlet Zidane Iqbal has been demoted to the reserves at his current club, Utrecht. The one-time Old Trafford academy standout has been dispatched to Jong FC Utrecht as a disciplinary measure.",
      "Iqbal is set to miss the forthcoming Europa League clash against Real Betis, with manager Ron Jans expressing dissatisfaction over the player's commitment during training prior to the international break. The 22-year-old recently earned his 22nd cap for Iraq after featuring in two matches against the United Arab Emirates, aiding his country's advancement in World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The midfielder has clocked up five appearances in the Eredivisie and two in the Europa League this season. However, reports from the Netherlands suggest that Iqbal has failed to convince Jans of his dedication.",
      "Manchester United have an ace in the hole that could help them land Antoine Semenyo during the January transfer window. And it's the kind of subtle gesture that could end up being the difference in whether they successfully negotiate a deal for the Bournemouth ace.",
      "Semenyo, 25, is being increasingly linked with a mid-season switch to Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim already made significant changes in attack over the summer but it's believed United are very interested in adding Semenyo to that assortment.",
      "The Ghana international is in demand after scoring six goals and recording three assists in the Premier League this season. But United will hope to turn his head with the promise of his preferred No. 24 shirt being ready on arrival.",
      "Ruben Amorim mentioned Manchester United youngsters Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher when he was asked how the team would cope with losing key players to the Africa Cup of Nations. Lacey and Fletcher took part in first-team training at Carrington on Friday morning, suggesting they have a chance of being named in the matchday squad when Everton visit Old Trafford.",

Lacey is pushing towards making a senior debut. The 18-year-old has always been one of the most highly regarded talents in his age group and has consistently performed in this campaign.",
      "Plenty of mistakes have been made since Ineos took control of football operations at Manchester United. Often the communication with supporters has been poor and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's treatment of fans when it comes to ticket prices and other matters has been rightly criticised.",
      "However, one area that has improved has been the recruiting and selling of players. Of course, not every piece of business will be universally welcomed but at least there seems to be a method which United are looking to implement in the transfer market.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged Manuel Ugarte to improve in training sessions amid concerns about his performances for Manchester United this season. Ugarte got off to a mixed start in Manchester after his €50million (£42.3m) transfer, with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons, from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2024.",
      "The midfielder was expected to improve after the appointment of Amorim. Ugarte played his best football under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, but he's been unable to reproduce those levels so far at Old Trafford. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season.",
      "The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions. Amorim was asked whether he was surprised by Ugarte's form and challenged him to improve.",
      "According to ESPN, Marcus Rashford has recovered from flu ahead of Barcelona's clash against Chelsea. The Club World Cup winners will host Hansi Flick's side in the UEFA Champions League at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.",
      "The United loanee, who swapped Old Trafford for the Camp Nou in the summer, missed Barcelona's 4-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday due to illness. Rashford returned to training at Ciutat Esportiva on Sunday.",
      "Joao Gomes has previously been compared to Casemiro by Matheus Cunha, who swapped Molineux for Old Trafford for £62.5m in the summer. The new United striker explained why his fellow countryman would be a welcome addition to Ruben Amorim's dressing room.",
      "When asked who the Wolves star reminds him of, the United ace said: \"Maybe Casemiro. He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive.",
      "\"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that. He is unbelievable on the pitch.",
      "Cunha said: \"I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "According to @MUFCAcademy91 on social media, Ruben Amorim has named Shea Lacey in the United squad for this evening's clash against Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "The 18-year-old has regularly trained with the first team this season as United prepare for the departures of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, who will play at the Africa Cup of Nations netx month.",
      "The report claims that Jack Fletcher has also been included in the United squad. Amorim has previously expressed his confidence in the two youngsters, claiming they're ready to 'step up'.",
      "According to The Mirror, it's 'highly unlikely' that Arsenal will sign Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window. It was recently revealed that the Bournemouth forward has a release clause in his contract, currently worth £65m, which will decrease at the end of the season.",
      "The report has named Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur as potential suitors for the time being. Semenyo signed a new long-term contract at the Vitality Stadium in the summer, keeping him at the Cherries until at least June 2030.",
      "At the end of last month, Ruben Amorim revealed that he expects out-of-favour players to hand in transfer requests in the coming weeks. As quoted by ESPN, the United boss said: \"A lot of things can happen.",
      "\"Even in our club, and you know that we have World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.\"",
      "Amorim refused to rule out the possibility of strengthening his squad over the festive period. He added: \"We want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United.",
      "\"We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... we want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen, but of course we think about how we can improve the team, and in January the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "According to Brazilian outlet Trivela, as quoted by GiveMeSport, United are 'close' to reaching an agreement to sign Joao Gomes from Wolves. The report claims that Ruben Amorim is keen to bring the 24-year-old midfielder to Old Trafford.",
      "It's said that the Reds are in the market for a new midfielder, with Casemiro expected to leave when his contract expires in the summer.",
      "According to the Sunday Mirror, Karim Adeyemi has set his sights on joining Arsenal. The Borussia Dortmund forward has been linked with a move to the Premier League on numerous occasions in the past, but a deal has never materialised.",
      "The report claims United have made contact with his agent, Jorge Mendes, to enquire about a potential move in the summer. Adeyemi has less than two years remaining on his contract at the Signal Iduna Park.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, Arsenal are closely monitoring Scott McTominay’s situation at Napoli. The report claims that Mikel Arteta wants to 'add steel' to his midfield in the January transfer window, so the Gunners have identified the Scot as an option.",
      "It's said that the Italian champions have no intention of letting McTominay go easily, with the club president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, setting an asking price of £60m. CaughtOffside reckons that 'only a substantial offer' will prise the former United ace from Naples.",
      "McTominay is reportedly happy in Italy, settled in Conte's project, and not actively pushing for a move...",
      "Ruben Amorim has named three United youngsters who could be given a chance to play over the festive period. When quizzed on the Africa Cup of Nations, the Reds boss said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience.",
      "\"We lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players, and then we had the injury of Amad [Diallo] for four months.",
      "\"All these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that, and again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea [Lacey], a lot of guys, they can step up.",

      "Speaking to the media ahead of Monday night's Premier League clash with Everton, the United boss addressed his player's situation.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" Amorim said. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation.",
      "\"I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",

      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, journalist Fabrizio Romano provided an update on the midfielder's future at Old Trafford with his contract ticking towards an end.",
      "While there is an acknowledgement he has been crucial to the team's resurgence this season, the financial aspects of a new deal currently present a stumbling block.",
      "\"Guys, my understanding is that the situation of Casemiro is a really similar situation in terms of strategy to Harry Maguire,\" Romano explained.",
      "“Casemiro and Maguire are out of contract in summer 2026. And for Manchester United, they are two really important players.",
      "“Especially now Casemiro, we have to say congrats to Casemiro in this video because he’s been able to change his situation at Manchester United.",
      "“So now the desire is from United obviously to continue with Casemiro but on different conditions. The salary he has right now is a salary that Manchester United don’t want to pay in the future.",
      "\"Not because of Casemiro or Maguire but because they want to change the salary structure. So at the moment for Casemiro eventually the only way to stay would be a different contract, a different salary.",
      "\"Otherwise he could be free next summer to go wherever he wants. He always had a lot of interest especially from Saudi Arabia.",
      "“So after his excellent performances recently, Casemiro obviously will have many clubs interested. But at the moment that’s the situation with Casemiro. Nothing guaranteed in terms of new contract because of the salary.",
      "“They need to find a solution on the salary structure together club and player, they have to try to find common ground on this point otherwise Casemiro could be leaving Manchester United in summer 2026.\"",
      "Few new signings at Manchester United have had the same immediate impact as Bryan Mbeumo in recent history, writes Jack Flintham.",
      "Brentford's talisman arrived at Old Trafford keen to pick up where he left off and has managed to do just that with six goals in 12 appearances. He has hit the ground running and the sky should be the limit for the 26-year-old.",
      "However, what could temper his momentum is the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). This winter, Mbeumo will join up with his Cameroon teammates for the continental competition and AFCON has proven to be a problem for Premier League clubs for many years now.",

      "Shea Lacey could quickly establish himself as a key player for Manchester United in the coming weeks. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad heading off to the Africa Cup of Nations, and Ruben Amorim eager to replenish his attacking options, the 18-year-old winger looks set to finally make his senior debut for his boyhood club.",
      "Before he began pushing for a place in the first team, Lacey had already built a significant following on social media. As the teenager climbed the ranks in the academy, he attracted lots of attention online, with highlight packages of his games often going viral.",
      "Lacey, who once beat Lamine Yamal to a player of the tournament award growing up, eventually got his first taste of senior football in the summer, joining Ruben Amorim's side for a post-season tour of Asia. The England youth international caught the eye, earning himself a place in the United squad in pre-season, with many inside the club said to be excited by his trajectory.",
      "As the new Premier League campaign got underway, Lacey returned to the under-21s, where he has since scored three goals and provided two assists in nine appearances. With Mbeumo and Amad set to feature at the Africa Cup of Nations next month, a senior debut for the youngster beckons.",
      "Amorim could even name Lacey in the United squad for Monday night's clash against Everton at Old Trafford. The Portuguese tactician has previously expressed his confidence in the teenager, claiming he's ready to 'step up'.",
      "Ahead of the Reds' clash against David Moyes' side, Amorim was asked how he'll manage the departures of Mbeumo and Amad. He said: \"I think it is going to be hard, but then, that is the good thing of the experience.",
      "\"We lived so many limitations last year. We changed in January and we didn’t bring the players, then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things. We are prepared for that. It will be hard for us, but we have different baggage to deal with that.",
      "\"Guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea [Lacey], they can step up. We can send, at the same time, a message to everyone here in the Academy that this is the future. But we are going to struggle, and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "On the academy, Amorim added: \"First of all, I’m not preparing the Academy, they are preparing the Academy. We are paying more attention to them, we are talking with them. That is so important to change information about the players, what they need, how they behave.",
      "\"To call a kid for the first team, they need to behave really well. This connection is really important. We are trying to do that. We are putting everything in place; nutrition is for the Academy, it starts now. In our club, that is something that should be basic.",
      "\"So, all these things we are doing, and they are doing their job. I have more time with them in training, so I’m more confident with them. When we put these kids to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but they will struggle less, I think.",
      "\"Everyone in the Academy is doing very well in the moment.\"",
      "Lacey is managed by the same talent management agency which looks after Wayne Rooney. And, the United legend is more than aware of the teenager's potential, having called him earlier this year to say: \"You're doing brilliant, keep doing what you're doing.\"",
      "The United prospect was called up to train with England at St. George's Park by Thomas Tuchel during the international break. When pressed on Lacey's development, Amorim claimed he's been delighted with his development.",
      "\"I’m really happy with him, I think he struggled a little bit with injuries,\" said the United boss. \"He did a very good job balancing his body. You can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our trainings are hard, but Premier League games with pressure are harder.",
      "\"So, they need to be ready.\"",

      "However, Ruben Amorim's side will have to do it without important members of the squad as injury issues begin to surface at the Theatre of Dreams. United are unbeaten in five after three wins and back-to-back draws, with two dramatic displays earning them a point in their last outings.",

Benjamin Sesko is set to remain sidelined through injury. The Slovenian was forced off during the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur with a knee injury.",
      "Reports emerged claiming that Sesko could be ruled out for up to a month with the injury.",

      "The 20-year-old will have to prove his fitness, in order to have a place in the squad.",
      "The Portuguese head coach admitted that Mainoo had yet to return to training as of Friday, but he had hopes that the midfielder would be back involved before the clash against Everton.",
      "\"Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see,\" said Amorim.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is still on the comeback trail as he continues his recovery from the knee injury which he suffered in February.",
      "The issue was severe enough for the Argentine to undergo surgery and since then, he has been building up his fitness in order to return to the starting 11.",
      "Amorim said recently that he hopes to have the Argentina international back on the pitch in the near future.",

      "Iqbal is set to miss the forthcoming Europa League clash against Real Betis, with manager Ron Jans expressing dissatisfaction over the player's commitment during training prior to the international break. The 22-year-old recently earned his 22nd cap for Iraq after featuring in two matches against the United Arab Emirates, aiding his country's advancement in World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The midfielder has clocked up five appearances in the Eredivisie and two in the Europa League this season. However, reports from the Netherlands suggest that Iqbal has failed to convince Jans of his dedication.",
      "Iqbal made the move to Utrecht from Manchester United in the summer of 2023, with the Dutch outfit shelling out £1million for his services.",
      "Having spent 11 years at United, Iqbal holds the distinction of being the first British South Asian to represent Manchester United. He had the option to play for England, Pakistan or Iraq, but ultimately chose the latter.",
      "Born in Manchester, Iqbal made his first-team debut in December 2021 in a Champions League match against Young Boys, under the stewardship of Ralf Rangnick. However, his progress hit a roadblock under Erik ten Hag.",
      "The young midfielder was previously on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade from manager Ten Hag during a training session. Footage captured the United boss shouting at the youngster.",
      "\"Keep the ball on the floor... Zidane! Hey! Keep the ball! F***ing rubbish!\" he said.",
      "Iqbal feels he wasn't given a proper opportunity under Ten Hag, which prompted him to seek a move elsewhere.",
      "In an interview with The National, Iqbal explained: \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn't seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United's first team.",
      "\"For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.\"",
      "Iqbal featured 18 times for Utrecht last season, following 17 Eredivisie appearances during his first campaign with the Dutch side. The international clearly still has ground to make up in establishing himself at the club.",

      "Plenty of mistakes have been made since Ineos took control of football operations at Manchester United. Often the communication with supporters has been poor and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's treatment of fans when it comes to ticket prices and other matters has been rightly criticised.",
      "However, one area that has improved has been the recruiting and selling of players. Of course, not every piece of business will be universally welcomed but at least there seems to be a method which United are looking to implement in the transfer market.",
      "Sporting director Jason Wilcox explained this on a recent episode of the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"Last year’s summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one. This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "\"These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath. We are very clear on the profiles that we need. The brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris.",
      "\"[There is] a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need and then the scouts will go into the market. We combine that with the data team and there will be constant dialogue. Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team of the profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable with Ruben as well. It is a really joined up approach.\"",
      "This is a world away from the recruitment plan under Erik ten Hag. At times it seemed as though he was solely responsible for identifying possible targets.",
      "While some of his ex-players have proven to be decent buys - Lisandro Martinez started well and Matthijs de Ligt is getting better every week - many others fell short of the required standard. But if Wilcox is true to his word and the manager still has a say in recruitment, the board need to listen to what Amorim had to say this week.",
      "Amorim was asked why his team's level was dropping off in the second half of matches. In response, the Portuguese head coach highlighted two players' absences - two players who could no longer be with the Reds at the start of next season.",
      "He said: \"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players. Not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.\"",
      "The United duo are both out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, neither man will be staying beyond then. Casemiro has stated he wishes to continue playing football beyond this campaign. Despite United having an option to extend his contract by a further 12 months, the Reds would rather negotiate a new deal to lower his salary.",
      "United have already used the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months and so a new deal would need to be struck. United will likely want to lower his wages to reflect the amount of playing time he will have beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire seems the most likely to stay at present but if one, or both, of these players leave Old Trafford in 2026, United have a job on their hands to replace them. Amorim knows neither man is the future of United but what they both have shown is that the team looks weaker when they are not on the pitch.",
      "This should have alarm bells ringing inside Old Trafford. Replacing players with such Premier League and European experience will be a difficult task and this interview alone has ensured the issue has been flagged early.",
      "If both end up leaving, United will need to replace them with quality, experienced players. If they are not able to, they risk losing key squad depth for 2026/27.",

      "Manchester United are expected to include academy starlet Shea Lacey in their matchday squad to play Everton on Monday night, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim is thought to want to integrate the player before Amad and Bryan Mbeumo head away on AFCON duty - with tonight's clash seen as an ideal opportunity to start that process.",
      "The 18-year-old has been tipped for big things at United, having been on the radar of some fans for the past three years, with impressive performances for the academy catching the eye.",
      "Lacey has featured plenty for the under-18s since the 2022/2023 season, though this campaign has seen him take the step up to join the Under-21s, helping their efforts in the Premier League 2.",
      "The youngster has largely played as a right winger, with his stronger left foot allowing him to cut inside and cause plenty of problems for opponents, something which could suit playing one of the 'two 10' roles in Amorim's system, though he is also comfortable playing on the left-hand side or as an attacking midfielder.",
      "With three goals and two assists for the Under-21s so far this season, there is some hope that Lacey can continue to take steps towards being a regular part of the senior squad.",
      "That opportunity to make an impression appears to be sooner rather than later, as a report from MUFC Academy on social media claims the United academy prospect will be included in the squad vs Everton. If Amorim does integrate him, at this stage, then it'll be the first matchday squad the youngster has made for the senior side, as he looks to continue working his way to the top.",
      "With AFCON also starting in late December, there is less than a month for the head coach to consider his options to replace some key stars, such as Amad and Mbeumo. While there was some suggestion that January's transfer window could help bolster those areas, the manager has already made it clear that he would rely on the academy to help instead.",
      "\"It is a concern, but we already knew [about that],\" Amorim said about the players he will be missing. \"There is an opportunity for other players. We have also the under-21s.",
      "\"We need to send a message in that time so we will see. Of course, it is not ideal because they are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad but, again, our academy is for these moments and so they will be ready.\"",
      "While it's unclear just how much of an impact Lacey could make over that period without those important players, his raw talent has certainly come in for some praise.",
      "Lee Carsley, who manages the England Under-21s, has been keeping a keen eye on the United youngster, who has featured for England Under-20s so far.",
      "The head coach gave plenty of praise to the forward when he told The Daily Mail: \"He has been in the pathway a good amount of time now, and he's a player that we rate highly. It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing, and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s.",
      "\"You can see he's a good talent. I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development - but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time. He trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",

Greater Manchester's economic growth continues to outstrip the rest of the country with an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has stated every borough should benefit.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London. Burnham had said that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, but conversations had been ongoing about the regeneration project surrounding the stadium.",
      "Now, an initial commitment of £26m for 382 new homes as part of the Trafford Wharf development has been promised – the first major investment in the Old Trafford regeneration area.",
      "The investment for the area around Old Trafford is part of the Greater Manchester growth plan.",
      "Collette Roche, United chief operating officer, said: “We are delighted to see the Old Trafford regeneration project at the heart of Greater Manchester’s wider growth plan for the next decade.",
      "“We want to build the world’s best football stadium as a new home for Manchester United and a venue fit for the biggest international events, including the 2035 FIFA Women’s World Cup, surrounded by a vibrant business, leisure and residential district served by excellent transport links.",
      "“We are determined to play our part, together with other stakeholders, in making this vision a reality, and unlocking the huge benefits it can deliver for the surrounding community and wider region.”",
      "Burnham has hailed the Old Trafford regeneration project as the United Kingdom's largest sports-led scheme since the London 2012 Olympics, with around 15,000 homes set to be built alongside the new 100,000-seat football stadium, as well as areas for leisure and business.",
      "The Mayoral Development Corporation was recently established for the regeneration project, and Burnham confirmed Lord Sebastian Coe has been appointed as its chair designate.",

      "United must reach a deal to purchase the rail yard surrounding Old Trafford before they can push ahead with stadium plans. The land is owned by Freightliner, and the parties are yet to reach an agreement.",
      "Burnham has suggested compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal can not be agreed, but sources confirmed last month United were \"optimistic\" of reaching a breakthrough.",

      "In an interview with the United We Stand magazine last year, Sir Jim Ratcliffe slammed the data department at Old Trafford. “Until we are as good as anyone in the world, then it’s not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn’t really exist here. We’re still in the last century on data analysis here. There’s an immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we’re in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don’t happen overnight. You can’t just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It’s all about people and we need to find the right people.”",
      "United announced the appointment of Michael Sansoni as director of data in the summer. Ratcliffe discussed the importance of bringing in the \"right people\" and landed his prime target.",
      "Sansoni was previously the senior performance engineer at the Mercedes F1 team and contributed to eight world championship-winning seasons. United confirmed that Sansoni would be tasked with establishing the club as a data-led organisation, embedding predictive and AI-driven decision-making.",
      "The University of Southampton graduate joined United two months before the official announcement of his appointment, allowing him to be involved in transfers in the summer window.",
      "In July, Sansoni said United had made \"meaningful progress\" with \"new methodologies starting to take shape and two fantastic signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\".",
      "He added: \"I’ve inherited a brilliant team: smart, committed, and hungry to make a difference and together we’re building a world-class data and AI function to power decision-making across football and the wider club. The challenge is great, but so is the opportunity. We’re only just getting started.\"",
      "United's data-led review of 2024/2025 identified the attack as the priority area for strengthening, concluding the shortage of goals was the biggest factor in the team's underperformance.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens arrived in the second half of the summer transfer window. They were different signings to Cunha and Mbeumo, arriving with no Premier League experience, but the numbers were crunched on both players and United were happy to splash a combined £84.8million.",
      "The press release announcing Sesko's transfer noted that he had scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe's top five leagues over the past two seasons.",
      "Jason Wilcox said: \"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at United.\"",
      "United sources pointed to Lammens' underlying statistics when he signed. They said the Belgium international had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe, with a post-shot expected goals of +14.5, and highlighted he had made more saves than any other goalkeeper in Europe's top 10 leagues.",
      "In layman's terms, post-shot expected goals look at how many goals more or less a goalkeeper has conceded than he's been expected to, based on the quality of shots they have faced. Lammens had essentially prevented 14 goals that an 'average' goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to stop.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.\"",
      "Sesko has scored just two goals since his arrival from RB Leipzig, but Ruben Amorim has backed him to succeed. On the other hand, Lammens has \"surprised\" Amorim with the extent of his impact.",
      "United's business in the summer window appears to be an improvement on previous years. How much the data is responsible for that is up for debate, but the club's data department, by all accounts, has improved. Sansoni has played a key role and he is currently recruiting staff.",
      "When Sansoni's appointment was communicated, United said further recruitment is planned for a number of data, software and platform engineering roles in the coming months.",
      "Ratcliffe has been ruthless with his club-wide cuts. The employee count has been slashed significantly and every outgoing penny is now scrutinised, but the data department is not shrinking - it's growing.",
      "The United co-owner believes that investing in data can give United an edge, which will theoretically save millions of pounds in the long run. Just think how much has been wasted on transfer fees alone.",
      "United are in the process of hiring a data operations manager to join Sansoni's team to \"drive data and technology projects forward\". Sansoni has invited hopefuls who are passionate about data to get in touch.",
      "Sansoni is doing important work behind the scenes, impacting United's recruitment.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that academy players who are \"maybe not good enough\" to play for Manchester United could be sold to raise funds to work within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Nick Cox helped raise £100million from academy sales during his six-year stint as head of the youth system, but United's director of football Jason Wilcox has identified that as an area where improvement can be made.",
      "Cox joined Everton to become their technical director in September. Former Manchester City academy chief Stephen Torpey was hired from Brentford to succeed Cox, and Torpey has been tasked with increasing revenue from academy sales, while also producing players for the first team at Old Trafford.",
      "United have a proud history of giving opportunities to young players, but some believe Amorim has not given enough chances to talented youngsters from the academy system.",
      "Speaking to Stan Sports, Amorim admitted that he found it difficult to prioritise academy players when he was first appointed. He also discussed why selling academy players has become increasingly important in the era of PSR rules.",
      "\"First thing, when I arrived last year, it was really tough,\" Amorim said. \"We had so many games but no time to prepare everything, to look around, to understand the game and the kids that are here, what is the plan for them and talk with all the coaches to try to arrange the perfect space to play.",
      "\"Under-18, Under-21, who is going to play where, so we are doing that now. I'm enjoying that part. I think it's going to be, like any club in the world, but especially here in England with the fair play. The players that you can put in the first team to feel the badge, but also the players that are maybe not good enough to play for Manchester United, but can give us some money when you sell them to try to compensate for the financial fair play to buy different players.",
      "\"So I think the future of our club is going to be the academy because, like you said, if you look at the biggest years with the most success was with the academy players.\"",
      "Amorim added: \"In the current moment, we also have that part if you sell a player from our academy, all the money you can use it to buy another. So I think we need to be really focused on that.",
      "\"Our sporting director has a background with the academies and young kids, so we are doing everything to put these kids in the first team for us to be competitive in any way in the Premier League.\"",
      "United banked £40m from the sale of Alejandro Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The sale represented 'pure profit' in the books and was the highest-ever sale of a United academy graduate.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) from Napoli for the sale of Scott McTominay in the summer of 2024. Amorim was asked to explain what he looks for in a young player, and he said: \"It's an honour to play for Manchester United. Sometimes, some kids take that for granted. That is the first thing.",
      "\"Then you have to look, to play in the Premier League nowadays, the physicality is something you cannot run from. You need to pay attention to that. Then you need to help the kids to cope with the media attention. That is something that we need to work and be really careful when one kid makes one game, not to make a big deal of that.",
      "\"And we had some issues in the past when we did that, and we got that wrong. And then the most important thing is talent and working hard. That is the things we are looking for from our players.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu claimed Manchester United \"have enough good players\" when asked whether he would like to share a dressing room with Scott McTominay at Old Trafford after his wonderful goal against Denmark. The former United midfielder was sold in 2024 to Napoli - five months prior to Dorgu's United arrival - and since then he has been impressing in Serie A.",
      "This week the midfielder helped Scotland beat Dorgu's Denmark 4-2 at Hampden Park to secure the home nation's qualification to the World Cup in USA, Mexico and Canada. McTominay opened the scoring after less than five minutes with a tremendous overhead kick.",
      "United loanee Rasmus Hojlund scored from the penalty spot to level the game before Lawrence Shankland guided in a corner to give the Scots the advantage. Denmark only needed a point to qualify automatically and Dorgu's late strike looked to have earned them just that but two late goals saw them settle for a place in the play-offs.",
      "When asked post-match if he would like to be playing alongside McTominay at United, Dorgu said: \"It was a good goal but we also have enough good players at United as well. I am happy for him winning the league in Napoli.\"",
      "The next international break is not until March at which point Denmark will need to beat North Macedonia and then either Czechia or the Republic of Ireland to progress to the World Cup. Dorgu insists his focus is now on succeeding with the Reds until then.",
      "He said: \"100% we just need to look forward. We are in a really good position at United.",
      "\"We will go back with confidence to help the team to get more wins. Denmark is now March. It is a long time and we just need to concentrate on club matters until then.\"",
      "Dorgu is expected to be back in the United squad on Monday night when they host Everton in the Premier League. A win for the Reds could move them into the top four.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Semenyo, 25, is set to be at the epicentre of a Premier League bidding frenzy. The 25-year-old, whose explosive start to the 2025-26 season has yielded six Premier League goals – trailing only Erling Haaland (14), Igor Thiago (9) and Danny Welbeck (7) – is the subject of serious interest, with approaches ‘imminent’, per sources.",
      "Tottenham, under Danish tactician Thomas Frank, are poised to act decisively. Frank, who once hailed Semenyo as Bournemouth’s “main threat” during his time at Brentford, is eager to elevate Spurs’ attacking firepower amid their goal-shy campaign.",
      "With Richarlison one goal behind Semenyo’s tally, insiders say Spurs are READY to match the £65million release clause in Semenyo’s contract, which activates in January but expires on a fixed date, allowing Bournemouth time to sign replacements.",
      "This clause, down from a £70million summer valuation, represents a bargain for a player whose counter-attacking prowess has terrorised defences.",

      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and that becaome three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a ferociously mediocre Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. And it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",

      "Liverpool, are you f***ing this up?",
      "We really think they might be f***ing this up. Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, they seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, it’s played six, lost six in the Premier League as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 11-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have a truly hilarious and motley collection of other clubs that encompass all the Premier League has to offer.",
      "The mini-crisis is now absolutely massive, and even if Liverpool do sort themselves out in due course – as surely they must – their title chances already look lost.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "It has been argued that Liverpool may soon have no choice but to sack Arne Slot, while Jurgen Klopp has been backed to make a return to management.",
      "Thomas Frank lands in the losers alongside Arne Slot after his embarrassing five-word admission after defeat to the really quite ridiculously good Arsenal.",
      "The actual Premier League standings are damning enough on Liverpool, but these five tables highlight why the champions find themselves in the bottom half…",
      "Pep Guardiola said ‘now the real season starts’ for Manchester City before Newcastle – and it might already be over as Arsenal capitalised on their defeat.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has hatched a plan to ‘drop’ Ibrahima Konate from his starting XI for PSV on Wednesday night.",
      "Is it time to ask whether Alexander Isak is the biggest flop in Premier League history? It’s been a perfect storm of crud for Liverpool’s big-money signing."

      "The Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line. The fact that he is already as long as 25s here shows how far he is behind…",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "Lammens continues to dazzle United fans with simple competency. The Belgian made a couple of fine saves at Spurs and could do little to stop either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "A first clean sheet in seven sees Pickford climb here. The England keeper just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",

      "Poor old Sancho, 25, has never made his mark at Manchester United since joining from Borussia Dortmund in a €100m move in 2021, despite having had the chance to impress three permanent managers in that time.",
      "That has led United to send Sancho out on three different loan spells, first back to Dortmund, then to Chelsea, and now Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho’s contract at United is set to expire at the end of the season, which makes it likely he has already played his last game for the club.",
      "But what the future holds for Sancho after that remains a mystery, with his contract at United potentially putting him in a difficult spot next summer.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED TRANSFER GUFF ON F365\n👉 Man Utd transfer ‘not going to happen in January’ as another deal is rated as a ‘maybe’\n👉 Record-breaking Man Utd transfer in tatters as Real Madrid star’s new contract is ‘already closed’\n👉 Man Utd ‘confident’ of striking cut-price transfer for England international",
      "Caught Offside write that Dortmund are keen to give Sancho a third spell at the club, but not so keen that they are willing to pay the winger anything like the kind of money he is said to be on at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho is reported to be on wages of £300,000 per week – twice the figure that Dortmund would be willing to pay him.",
      "The far greater riches available to Premier League clubs, and especially a massive club like Manchester United, enable them to pay significantly more than Dortmund would reasonably be able to offer.",
      "The Bundesliga side are also said to be unwilling to make an exception and break their wage structure to re-secure Sancho’s signature. That would leave Sancho either needing to take a biiiig old 50% pay cut.",
      "Giving up nearly £8m a year would be a major blow to Sancho’s wallet, of course, though we’re sure sympathy for his position will rightly be somewhat limited given he would, in fact, still be earning nearly £8m a year.",
      "There’s also the fact that, let’s face it, Sancho’s stock is considerably lower now than it was  when he signed that lucrative contract at United, so he may well not get a better offer than whatever Dortmund put on the table.",
      "After his thoroughly underwhelming spell at Chelsea last season, Sancho has still not really got going at Aston Villa. He is yet to make a start in the Premier League, with Unai Emery only opting to name him in the first XI in the Europa League and the League Cup.",
      "Solskjaer says a poorly ear was to blame for Sancho’s struggles under him at Man Utd but can’t put his finger on why Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at Old Trafford.",
      "An insider has revealed the thoughts of Manchester United on Jadon Sancho, who is on loan with Aston Villa, with the final opportunity for his sale approaching.",
      "Estevao is a £104m player who can raise the energy of a home crowd like no other in the Premier League. He is not “doing the same thing” as Sancho.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy have decided that Jadon Sancho’s time at the club is “definitely up”, according to reports.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "Brus had heard that a £70m fee ‘might be realistic’ but now sources have told him that Man Utd are hopeful of at least opening talks for even less.",
      "One source told Brus: “Financially, the situation is complex.",

      "Amid talk of a sensational return to Old Trafford for Scott McTominay, Gary Lineker has handed Manchester United an excuse they don’t deserve for selling him in the first place.",

      "To suggest he would even have been in the minds of the voting journalists in his time at United would have been laughable, and the decision-makers at Old Trafford in no way merit the sympathy being afforded to them by Lineker on The Rest Is Football.",
      "“What a spell he’s having in his career. You know, he goes from Manchester United, probably his club that he played for since a boy.",
      "“And then he was probably, I mean, surely they must have seen the talent that he had?",
      "“But I suspect he was sold because of the PSR rules and you get, you know, a bigger advantage because he’s a homegrown lad, which strikes me as absolutely wrong.”",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag did indeed blame the perverse PSR rules when asked why McTominay was sold.",
      "“Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",

      "We accept that United probably wouldn’t have sold McTominay for £25.4m if those rules didn’t exist. What we take issue with is Lineker’s claim that United in any way “saw the talent he had”.",
      "He was a squad player; no more than a guy who was ‘good to have around’. He started just 18 Premier League games in his final season and in the two campaigns in which he was the first-choice option he was one half of McFred having been inextricably paired with another player deemed not good enough to be starting regularly for the club.",
      "Conte realised his talent immediately. Having operated as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot in over half of his appearances for his boyhood club, at Napoli he’s played as a No.8, No.10 and even on the wing to ensure he can make the difference in the final third, where he’s evidently at his best.",
      "Pure profit or not, selling McTominay for just £25.4m is evidence enough of what United thought of a player who’s now easily worth twice that much.",

      "Chelsea: Liam Delap\nAdmittedly a very small sample size thanks to the injury and absurd red card, but on a scale from useless lump to world-class striker he’s currently closer to Chris Sutton than Didier Drogba.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Eddie Nketiah\n“I’m astounded they let Nketiah join Palace,” Teddy Sheringham said in February. “I think he is a young Ian Wright.”",
      "Wright scored 113 Premier League goals in 213 games. Nketiah has scored 23 in 150.",
      "",
      "Everton: Jack Grealish\nWe were among those banging the Grealish for England drum, irked by his snub as the Premier League’s runaway assist leader with four by the time the September internationals rolled around. But two of those assists came against Wolves, and should thus be stricken from the record, and he hasn’t managed another in his seven games since, scoring just one goal.",
      "In the cold light of day, having put down our ‘We heart Jack’ placards, we’ve come to accept that England are probably better off with a bit of speed on the left wing and our ‘top lads’ agenda may be clouding our view with regard to him playing in a No.10 position he’s taken up roughly thrice in the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",
      "While one Hale End pin-up is now widely regarded as one of the best footballers on the planet, the other tends to watch Harry Wilson play football from the bench.",
      "",
      "Leeds: Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n58 goals in 248 Premier League games raises one big question: How has a striker who’s only scored 58 goals in 248 Premier League games played 248 Premier League games? Take out a two-season glut and he’s scored 25 goals in 163.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Florian Wirtz\nWe’re currently at the anger stage in the Premier League flop process, barraged by Wirtz advocates, mainly hailing from his homeland, insisting Gary Neville and his other critics will soon be eating their words.",
      "If it’s anything like the stages of grief, and we suspect it is as Bundesliga voices have already had great difficulty accepting the reality of the loss of Wirtz in that initial period of denial, we can expect Alexander Isak and others to be put forward as bigger flops in a bargaining bid, before depression and finally acceptance that a) Wirtz was hugely overrated, and b) the Premier League is indeed, without question, The Best League In The World.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nIt turns out a game against Wolves on the opening day of the season, after which Reijnders was hailed as Manchester City’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva in one neat little 82kg bundle, isn’t quite the harbinger of success many thought it was.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Senne Lammens\nWe very much enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek “are you Schmeichel in disguise?” chants from Manchester United fans as Lammens claimed simple crosses that his recent predecessors often contrived to make a mess of on his debut against Sunderland.",
      "But those tongues are now conspicuously absent from cheeks as genuine claims are being made about the 23-year-old being the undisputed answer to the Red Devils’ goalkeeping woes after literally five games of simple competency.",

      "Nottingham Forest: Omari Hutchinson\nWe wonder if the fourth manager Evangelos Marinakis picks to manage Forest this season might fancy the £37m club-record signing.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Simon Adingra\nNot easy – they’re fourth, FFS – but of the 13 players Sunderland signed in the summer we were perhaps most excited by what Adingra might do having impressed in fits and starts at Brighton; it’s not really happened for him.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Lucas Paqueta\nWe are very intrigued by what might happen if Paqueta extricates himself from West Ham in 2026, as is suggested will be the case, because for every game in which he does something entirely out of keeping with the quality of the football club he currently plays for, there are half a dozen more where he looks as though he might have found his level.",

      "Here’s how the tournament interferes with the Premier League schedule…",
      "Any players called up are likely to leave their clubs after matchweek 16 and players representing nations that reach the semi-finals will be back for matchweek 23. So doing their national duty could make them miss six league matches.",
      "The AFCON group stage concludes on December 31, so any players from nations that fail to make the knockout stages could return for matchweek 20, over the weekend of January 3 and 4.",
      "The FA Cup third round is scheduled for the weekend of January 10, by which time, AFCON will be down to the quarter-finalists.",
      "The Champions League and Europa competitions take a break throughout the duration of AFCON but recommence in the week beginning Monday January 19 – the day after the final.",

      "Sunderland might need all that positive momentum to get them through AFCON since the seven they are set to lose have been good for 40 Premier League starts this season. At least they should be around for the Tyne-Wear derby on December 14, but all are guaranteed to miss a trip to Brighton and the visits of Leeds and Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Marshall Munetsi (Zimbabwe), Emmanuel Agbadou (Ivory Coast), Jackson Tchatchoua (Cameroon), Tolu Arokodare (Nigeria), Tawanda Chirewa (Zimbabwe).",
      "Munetsi will be the biggest miss for already the Premier League’s worst team so far but Chirewa is yet to feature in the league this season. Wolves fixtures during the AFCON group stage: Brentford at home; Liverpool and Manchester United away.",
      "Idrissa Gueye (Senegal), Iliman Ndiaye (Senegal), Adam Aznou (Morocco)",
      "Everton’s Senegalese duo have been ever-presents in the Premier League, having scored half of the Toffees’ goals this season between them. The prospect of an Aznou call-up seems remote since he hasn’t been called up by Morocco since he left Bayern Munich. And David Moyes would barely notice he was gone anyway.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Nigeria), Calvin Bassey (Nigeria), Samuel Chukwueze (Nigeria)",
      "Iwobi has started every game and Bassey is only one behind, so both will be missed. Chukwueze has come off the bench four times. All will miss clashes with Forest and West Ham so the Nigerian trio could return to a bleaker scene at the Cottage.",

      "Losing Sarr is a blow, especially for the Carabao Cup quarter-final against Arsenal, but Oliver Glasner won’t be concerned about the other three; Riad and Doucoure have been long-term absentees while Uche has only seen action off the bench.",

      "This looks worse than it is. Sangare will go and Boly will want to join him but even if he makes the squad, he hasn’t featured for Forest in the Premier League this season. Aina has been missing since the middle of September with a hamstring injury, while Awoniyi hasn’t been called up by Nigeria since October 2024.",

      "",
      "Dango Ouattara (Burkina Faso), Frank Onyeka (Nigeria)",
      "Ouattara’s absence comes as a blow for Keith Andrews, while Onyeka has been a semi-regular presence off the bench. The Carabao Cup quarter-final at Manchester City will be the first game the pair miss.",

      "Monday 24 November 2025 10:39, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Monday 24 November 2025 08:30, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has emerged as Ruben Amorim's most important Manchester United player this season.",
      "A stalwart at the back, the central defender is the only player to have played every single minute of United's Premier League campaign so far this term.",
      "With Amorim a known tinkerman, not least during games, especially at centre-back, De Ligt's ever presence is a testament to his growing influence at Old Trafford.",
      "When De Ligt signed for United in August 2024, Old Trafford had acquired a then-24-year-old who had struggled to live up to the lofty billing of his early career.",
      "Having captained Ajax at 18, De Ligt was tipped to become one of the game's finest defenders. He became the first defender to win the Golden Boy in 2018, the trophy awarded to the best U21 player.",
      "That was before his starring role in the Champions League as Ajax famously reached the semi-final in 2019, where his displays in that campaign propelled his worth.",
      "A move to Juventus came next for the defender, with the world at his feet, and Bayern Munich also followed. However, despite a healthy trophy return in that period, the pace of his early development had slowed, and De Ligt had become an injury-prone disappointment.",
      "Now, it seems as though De Ligt has been living through a personal renaissance. At 26, things have started to come together for the Dutchman. He's often used as the right centre-back in Amorim's oft-discussed back three but is more than capable of filling in centrally.",
      "On the opening day, a colossal performance, despite defeat to Arsenal, saw De Ligt take care of Viktor Gyokeres in a showing that paved for things to come.",
      "In the league, his performances have sustained, standing as one of United's outstanding options at the back. Among defenders at the club, De Ligt leads the way for aerial duels won and interceptions.",
      "De Ligt is also among United's best tacklers and passers, factoring in defenders at the club. They are performances that have been rewarded with a recall into the Netherlands National team by boss Ronald Koeman.",
      "For the Dutchman, his upturn in form is a reflection of a growing maturity and fewer injuries.",
      "\"I'm 26 now and I'm entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" De Ligt told Dutch outlet NOS.",
      "\"I've changed my mindset. Initially, I didn't want to make mistakes; now I want to do as many good things as possible.'",
      "Asked about his form, De Ligt added: \"There are a few explanations for that. I've had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body.",
      "\"This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "De Ligt's goal to earn United a draw at Tottenham just before the international break felt like the culmination of months of assured displays. However, despite his history as a leader, De Ligt was not named in Amorim's leadership group.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui were put forward by Amorim as his group to oversee the dressing room at the beginning of the season.",
      "\"Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play,\" Amorim said following the draw at Spurs.",
      "\"Then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other.\"",
      "Amorim's growing reliance on De Ligt, may be a cause for the Portuguese coach to rethink his decision. However, despite De Ligt's form, Amorim believes we are yet to see the Dutchman at his flying best.",
      "\"He is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well,\" Amorim added after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball. That is a smart thing for a player.",
      "\"But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",
      "Amorim's words owe to his desire to one day see United be the dominant side when they are also the side dominating possession. By his own admission, currently, United are some way from that.",
      "However, with the in which he has established himself so far this season, the stalwart that is De Ligt may be the anchor of United's defensive plans going forward.",

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",
      "The three tests are:",
      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",

      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games."

      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",
      "Have Liverpool lost their physical edge? Last week we revealed the alarming numbers behind their out-of-possession drop-off.",
