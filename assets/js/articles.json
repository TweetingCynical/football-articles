      "Manchester United's new investor has issued a frank assessment of how the environment at Old Trafford has hardly helped any manager post-Sir Alex Ferguson succeed",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS Sports crew are now overseeing football operations at Manchester United after the billionaire purchased 25 per cent of the Red Devils.",
      "One thing that has been up for discussion since Ratcliffe arrived at Old Trafford is the future of manager Erik ten Hag. The Dutchman has overseen an underwhelming season so far, but hopes of Champions League qualification are still alive after a recent run of fine form.",
      "For the majority of the current campaign, Ten Hag has had to endure rumours regarding his long-term future, with some fans and pundits alike suggesting that the ex-Ajax boss is not the man to turn the tide on United's recent fortunes and restore them to their former glories.",
      "However, it doesn't look like Ratcliffe agrees. The British billionaire has instead shone a light on the fact that no United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 has really enjoyed a period of sustained success. He feels that must be an indictment on the culture, rather than the man in the dugout.",
      "\"What I would say, if you look at the last 11 years, Man United have had quite a few coaches,\" Ratcliffe explained. \"Nobody has been successful in that Manchester United environment. That would say to me that there's something wrong with the environment.\"",
      "Before those remarks, he also explained that any fans hoping United can be back to their best as soon as possible are sorely mistaken. Ratcliffe added: \"It has clearly been a difficult 11 years since Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill retired.",
      "\"It's not switching a light switch. It's not just a simple short-term fix. We have to walk to the right solution, not run to the wrong one. The short-term issue is we want to get into the Champions League.",
      "\"It's a two-to-three-season challenge to get the organisation and environment right, to get the performances on the field right and win football matches. That involves the design and structure of the organisation being correct.\"",
      "Ten Hag is contracted to the club until the summer of 2025, but as shown by his predecessors, there is precious little job security whilst operating in the United hot seat.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has seen his 27.7 per cent purchase of Manchester United confirmed and the INEOS founder has provided his insight into the decision that will be made on Mason Greenwood's future",
      "Mason Greenwood could still have a career at Manchester United with new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe saying a decision will be made at the end of the season.",
      "The United forward was arrested in October 2022 and charged with attempted rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Those charges were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "Greenwood then joined Getafe in September and it was widely expected that the 22-year-old, who has a contract until 2025, would be sold at the end of the season. Ratcliffe, though, has established that nothing was set in stone for the forward.",
      "He said: \"We will make a decision, correct. All I can do is talk about the principle of how we will approach decisions like that. Is he the right type of footballer, are we happy with if is he a good person or not?",
      "\"He's a Manchester United footballer, so we are in charge of football. So the answer is 'Yeah, we have to make decisions. It's quite clear we have to make a decision. There is no decision that's been made. He's on-loan obviously, but he's not the only one. We've got one or two footballers that we have to deal with and we have to make a decision on so we will do that.",
      "\"The process will be: understand the facts not the hype, and then try and come to fair decision on the basis of values, which is basically is he a good guy or not? Could he play sincerely for Manchester United well, would we be comfortable with it and would the fans be comfortable with it?\"",
      "Ratcliffe's comments came after the INEOS founder saw his purchase of 27.7 per cent of United confirmed on Wednesday evening. The Red Devil's chief has already been questioned on the likes of Old Trafford, the possible arrival of Dan Ashworth and overhauling Manchester City and Liverpool, in addition to Greenwood.",
      "The United loanee will see out the season in La Liga having scored seven goals and produced five assists in 24 appearances for Getafe. Greenwood has looked to rebuild his career in Spain.",
      "The forward noted earlier this term, that he was happy with the move. He said: \"Everything's fine, I adapted pretty quickly. My team-mates took me under their wing and I’ve just been happy ever since coming here, training and playing the games.",
      "\"The fans mean a lot to me. The best feeling so far is when I scored my first goal here at the stadium. \"It meant a lot to me, I heard the fans quite a lot. Also, we had the training day and a lot of fans came out and watched so we always appreciate the fans, they’re like an extra man out there on the pitch when they’re out there supporting us.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro feels that the future of the Red Devils' midfield is safe with this season's breakout star Kobbie Mainoo in the middle of the park",
      "Casemiro has heaped praise on Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo as speculation over his own future at Old Trafford continues.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side have endured a difficult season so far, though hopes of Champions League qualification are still alive as the business end of the campaign approaches. One shining light of United's season has been the breakthrough of Mainoo, who has starred in midfield after emerging from the club's academy set-up.",
      "At just 18 years of age, Mainoo's technical ability and composure on the ball defies his age and experience. The teenager has made just 11 Premier League appearances, but fans and pundits alike are already calling for the United ace to earn his first senior England call-up.",
      "Few know just how good Mainoo is better than his team-mates, so United fans should take note of the latest glowing review of the teenager, which comes from colleague Casemiro. The former Real Madrid man has heaped praise on his fellow midfielder.",
      "\"I think United will have a top player for the next years, easily,\" Casemiro explained. \"He's a top player. He's exceptional. He's a humble, hard-working player. He knows how to listen. He's a great player. Since I play alongside him, I know Manchester United will have one of the best midfielders in the Premier League for the next years, easily.\"",
      "If Casemiro's assessment that Mainoo will be one of the league's best over the next few years, it will certainly come in handy for the Red Devils given the Brazil international is expected to call time on his own United stay come the end of the season.",
      "Last term saw Casemiro enjoy a promising debut campaign at the club, helping United end their six-year trophy drought with a Carabao Cup win. He also played his part in United's run to the FA Cup final, where they were eventually beaten by local rivals Manchester City.",
      "However, the Selecao star has failed to recapture that form this season and has faced plenty of question marks regarding his age and for how much longer he can operate at the level required in the Premier League. The January transfer window saw plenty of speculation suggesting Casemiro could be the latest big name to ply his trade in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Though contracted to United until the summer of 2026, the likes of Al Nassr and Al Hilal have both been touted as potential destinations for Casmiro as soon as this coming summer.",

Ratcliffe made clear that though United's current stomping ground is in desperate need of a makeover, his preference would be to move the club somewhere new entirely.",
      "\"It's about time someone built a national stadium in the north of England,\" the INEOS chief explained. \"If it can be achieved, it would clearly be my preference. I would be very excited for the north of England.\"",
      "Ratcliffe's comments come after his purchase of 25 per cent of United was confirmed by the Premier League. The billionaire harbours hopes that by building a new ground, that same venue could host England fixtures, as well as FA Cup semi-finals and even the Champions League final in years to come.",
      "Old Trafford has actually hosted the Champions League final once before, all the way back in 2003 when AC Milan got the better of Serie A rivals Juventus. Ratcliffe feels that there has been a tendency to favour the south of the country when it comes to major sporting events.",
      "This season's Champions League final will be contested under the iconic Wembley arch. It has only been 11 years since it hosted the final of the 2013 edition of the competition for Bayern Munich's triumph over Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Many United fans had hoped extra seating could simply be added to Old Trafford, but Ratcliffe has made clear that would be difficult due to the age of the stadium.",
      "He claimed: \"Trafford Park is where the industrial revolution began. If you look at that region of Manchester today - only a mile from the centre - it is tired and neglected and parts are quite run down. There is quite a big argument, in my view, for regenerating that whole south side of Manchester.",
      "\"The nucleus of it would be building a new world-class state-of-the-art stadium which could take England games, the FA Cup final, Champions League finals. It could serve the north of England.",
      "\"There is a bias in the UK in terms of where national stadiums have been built - they are all in the south. There is a lot of talk about levelling up. HS2 has been cancelled and all that is going to be spent on the rail network in London.",
      "\"The people in the north pay their taxes just as the people in the south. Why shouldn't there be a venue in the north of England for England to play at? Why does everyone in the north have to go to the south for the semi-finals of the FA Cup?\"",

      "The Red Devils have approached Newcastle about poaching Ashworth and making him the club’s new sporting director, with Ratcliffe believing he is one of the best operators in world football. Ratcliffe, who is taking control of footballing operations at United, wants the ex-Brighton and England chief to overhaul the club’s recruitment department.",

United's other specialist in the position, Tyrell Malacia, is yet to make a single appearance this season following complications after knee surgery and the club decided to terminate Sergio Reguilon's loan spell from Tottenham early in January when Shaw returned.",
      "Lindelof is not a natural in the position and the other work-around seen earlier this season of Sofyan Amrabat playing at left-back also did not work out. United are sixth in the Premier League, five points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa. They will look to continue their momentum when they face Fulham at Old Trafford on Saturday",
      "Shaw's injury is also an issue for England manager Gareth Southgate as he looks ahead to Euro 2024 in Germany. The United defender will miss the friendlies against Brazil and Belgium next month and could be a doubt for the Euros as well. Chelsea defender Ben Chilwell is back fit again, but Shaw has been Southgate's preferred option at left-back when fully fit.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has seen his takeover of Manchester United approved and he is ready to rip up the existing structure that has been allowed to operate under the Glazer family",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has outlined his grand plan for Manchester United after finally seeing his takeover ratified.",
      "Although he has only bought a 27.7 per cent stake in the club, petrochemicals billionaire Ratcliffe has taken over sporting control of United from the Glazer family. Changes are already underway, with Omar Berrada hired from Manchester City to become the new chief executive after Richard Arnold stepped down.",
      "United are now chasing Newcastle’s Dan Ashworth to become their sporting director and are also keen to hire Southampton's Jason Wilcox in a role underneath him. It has previously been reported that INEOS could cut up to 300 jobs at the club to save costs.",
      "Erik ten Hag has overseen a run of four straight wins in the Premier League to strengthen his position at a crucial time. But the United manager knows he is under increased scrutiny now that INEOS is in town – and Ratcliffe has explained his vision in an interview with Belgian newspaper De Tijd.",
      "“We have to look at the organisation of the club because it is not good at the moment,” he said. “Take the head coach, for example, he must report directly to the CEO. That is no longer possible in a modern football organisation.",
      "“We have to ensure that the right people end up in the right positions. Every person in management must be world-class. And then it is important to create a positive, supportive, friendly and high-quality environment. That culture was missing before. Only in such an environment can you get the best out of sportsmen. If successful, the results will follow automatically. That's the plan and I believe in it.”",
      "Ratcliffe already owns French club Nice and Swiss side Lausanne and has a one-third share in the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 team. And his reputation as a ruthless decision-maker precedes him, as explained by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff in October: “This is a no bull**** organisation. They are huge in terms of revenue and profit. Decisions are being made quickly – three bullet points on a page and ‘here we go’.”",
      "The 71-year-old may be a boyhood United fan, but he has not tried to hide his reasons behind buying into the club. He has previously slammed United for spending “dumb money” on players and specifically mentioned the £70million deal for Casemiro as an example of the bad kind of business he wouldn’t sanction.",
      "Speaking after the completion was announced on Tuesday evening, Ratcliffe said: \"To become co-owner of Manchester United is a great honour and comes with great responsibility. This marks the completion of the transaction, but just the beginning of our journey to take Manchester United back to the top of English, European and world football, with world-class facilities for our fans. Work to achieve those objectives will accelerate from today.”",

      "The Manchester United icon has been out of work for around two years since leaving his job as Wales boss. He left the role amid charges of controlling or coercive behaviour and assault.",
      "The jury failed to reach a conclusion during Giggs’ initial trial. The Crown Prosecution Service then confirmed that plans to re-try the 50-year-old had been withdrawn.",
      "Since then, an opportunity to return to management has not been forthcoming for Giggs. But he has not ruled out taking a job again soon. Asked at an event in Chester if he could be in the dugout again, he replied: “I loved managing Wales, obviously. I do miss it so hopefully (I can manage again).”",
      "A return to the Welsh national team could potentially be on the cards should they fail to qualify for this summer’s upcoming Euros. Rob Page ’s side first have to navigate a semi-final against Finland and a potential final against Poland or Estonia next month.",
      "One role that Giggs has already ruled himself out of is at Salford City. He has regularly been linked with the job at the League Two side given their Man United associations.",
      "However, he rejected the prospect of taking the reins earlier this year. The Welshman said: “No. No, we’ve just got a new manager in. What does the future hold? I don’t know.",
      "“At the moment, I am enjoying being more involved with Salford City. I’ve enjoyed seeing the rise in the last 10 years. I’ve got a little bit more involved in the last six months and I’m enjoying that, to be fair.”",
      "Away from his spell with Wales, Giggs also had a spell as United boss at the end of David Moyes ’ disastrous spell. He oversaw the final four games of that campaign, claiming two wins and a draw and a defeat apiece.",
      "That solitary reverse came at the hands of Sunderland and actually gave Giggs motivation to pursue a career in the dugout. “It was actually when I realised I wanted to be a manager,” he revealed.",
      "“It was actually after a defeat. We got beaten by Sunderland and it was after that game I knew I had to drop teammates and I was still playing. After that, I had no problem changing the team, dropping players, and it was at that point that I knew I had that decision-making.”",

He was left fuming after it was snubbed for Euro 2028 with Manchester City's Etihad Stadium getting the nod.",
      "At the time he said: \"The Glazer family have, for years, been warned about a lack of investment in Old Trafford,' he said. 'They have overseen a decline for 20 years in which it has gone from being one of the best stadiums in the world to one that can't even get into the top 10 in the UK and Ireland. This is an all-time low. That it is not in the best 10 to host a tournament is a joke.\"",
      "The Times reports that Neville doesn't want to involve himself in any role that conflicts with his work for Sky Sports but is happy to offer up time to the project, which could yet see United move away from Old Trafford with all options currently being considered.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted he was wrong to hand in a transfer request at Manchester United after questioning the club's ambition.",
      "United legend Rooney put his Old Trafford future on the line back in 2010 by asking to leave after becoming disillusioned with the direction the club was taking. But after an impassioned address from Sir Alex Ferguson and a stand-off lasting 10 days, Rooney eventually signed a new deal and went on to become United's record scorer with 253 goals.",
      "But the former United and England skipper, now 38, reflected on that seismic episode in his career and concluded he was wrong to put his future at the club in jeopardy with the stance he took.",
      "Rooney, who was being courted by Europe's top clubs at the time, said: “It wasn’t Manchester City, it was more I wanted answers. There were a few teams asking – there was Real Madrid, Barcelona were asking, City were asking, Chelsea.",
      "“I genuinely wanted to stay, but there was a clash between me and the manager and, once you disagree with him, he doesn’t take it lightly. My relationship with the manager after that moment was never the same.",
      "“Being a manager now myself, and looking back, it was probably the wrong thing to do. At the time, I felt like it was the right thing to do to really get assurances for my own career. The club offered me a new five-year deal but we'd just sold Carlos Tevez and just sold Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "“I said to the manager ‘No disrespect to Phil Jones or Chris Smalling – they're obviously not going to replace Ronaldo and Tevez' and I just wanted assurances it wasn’t going to be another transition. He told me to get out of his office, so then I got more sense out of David Gill of what the plan was.",
      "“Once David had explained what the club were doing I said, ‘Fine, that’s all the manager had to say. That’s all the club had to tell me’ and then I signed the new deal.”",
      "Ferguson was succeeded by David Moyes in 2013, with Rooney claiming his former Everton boss was doomed to fail from the start – because the players did not believe in him.",
      "“The players never gave Moyes a chance,” said Rooney. “I think it was always going to be tough for him. I think there was a lack of respect from senior players towards him and they weren’t having him.”",
      "After Moyes came Louis van Gaal, who was sacked despite winning the FA Cup, the first trophy of the post-Ferguson era. “I was sad when Van Gaal left,” said Rooney. “During the 2016 FA Cup final, his wife found out that Louis was getting the sack, regardless of the result.”",
      "Van Gaal was replaced by Mourinho, under whom Rooney claimed he endured his most difficult spell. “Playing under Jose was probably my toughest year at United because I was captain, but I wasn’t playing,” said Rooney.",
      "“That was difficult for me, going into training every day as captain and having to put on a brave face, even though I wasn’t playing and wasn’t happy. Jose was a good person, and obviously you have your frustrations when you’re not playing, but he was a good guy.”",

      "Van Gaal took over at Old Trafford in 2014 after leading the Netherlands national team to third place at the World Cup in Brazil. He only lasted two seasons, though, with Jose Mourinho taking his place shortly after a 2016 FA Cup final victory.",
      "Rooney was impressed by the former Barcelona boss' tactical acumen, naming him as tactically the best manager he worked under. Things were tougher in other departments, though, including Van Gaal's approach to his squad's eating patterns.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, Rooney opened up on the rules put in place by Van Gaal, who hasn't been in management since leading the Netherlands to the World Cup quarter-finals in his last spell in charge. These included a mealtime rule which didn't go down too well with the playing staff.",
      "\"I thought he was a brilliant personality and there are some stories from his time at the club, which I can't say,\" Rooney said. \"His methods were difficult in how we worked off the pitch, but I loved his training",
      "\"Every day, we would finish training and would have to wait 90 minutes until we could have our food, then you have your food where one table goes up to get it at a time, with the staff table going up last, and then you'd have to wait for the manager to finish his food, and he'd have a three-course meal every day. When he finished his meal, he'd stand up and make a speech every day, and then we could leave.",
      "\"Before we left, he would then ask to speak to players individually and he would do it in order of seniority, so you had players sat outside his office waiting to be called in, one by one. I did say to him once that the players had gone and that he needed to change this process because it was getting difficult. Towards the end, Louis asked me how he could change to get the players back on side, but unfortunately it was too late by then.\"",
      "Van Gaal came out of retirement for his most recent Netherlands spell, though he's ruled out a return to club football. \"My health comes first. I don’t like being a coach at a club anymore,\" the 72-year-old, who has been receiving treatment for prostate cancer, told NOS in 2023.",
      "During a career spanning more than 30 years, Van Gaal led teams to three Champions League finals. He won the competition with Ajax in 1995, losing in the final 12 months later, and saw his Bayern Munich side beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the 2010 final.",
      "He had two spells at Barcelona and one in charge of AZ, winning the Eredivisie title with the Alkmaar side in 2009. He won back-to-back league titles in his first Barca stint, and led the Catalan club to the Champions League semi-finals in the 1999-2000 season.",

      "Manchester United were linked with him probably more out of hope than expectation for a player who has represented Brazil at under-21 level but not beyond.",

      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast from Sky Bet, the 38-year-old said: “I remember Louis van Gaal when he came in – I thought tactically he was the best I’ve worked with. It was the stuff off the pitch that was difficult for the players in how he worked, but I remember him coming in and saying he wants his centre forward to have 15, 20 touches a game – that’s exactly what [Erling] Haaland does. I always wanted to play and enjoy the game – and score goals.”",
      "It is not the first time that Rooney has made his bold claim. He was full of praise for the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss back in 2019 during his time with DC United.",
      "“Van Gaal is by far the best coach I have worked with - one hundred percent,” Rooney said. “His tactical skills, his way of preparing and his attention to the finest of details, I found amazing. I admired that in him. I had never looked at stuff like that before.”",

      "There have been reports suggesting that Barcelona were willing to offload the Dutch midfielder as they sought to get his wages off their bill. De Jong though has a contract until 2026 and claims reports around his salary are far from the truth and called for a change to the speculation.",

For example, [the media] speak a lot about my contract, my salary etc...it's a lot of smoke, a lot of lies, that I'm earning €40million or whatever.

      "Manchester United still have plenty to play for this season in both the Premier League and FA Cup and it appears that Erik ten Hag is already turning his attention to the upcoming summer transfer window",
      "Manchester United are still firmly in the battle to secure a spot in the Champions League come the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils’ win against Luton at the weekend leaves them sixth and just five points behind Tottenham. Their battle to reach the top four is set to ramp up over the coming weeks with a clash against Fulham, as well as a meeting with Manchester City.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side are also still in the FA Cup and will take on struggling Nottingham Forest in the fifth round. The Red Devils reached the final last term but lost out at Wembley.",
      "While there is still plenty to do this season, it appears that attention is already turning to next season at Old Trafford. Players continue to be linked with moves to Old Trafford, while some could exit. Take a look at all of the biggest headlines coming out of Man United over the past 24 hours.",
      "One man who is reportedly on the Red Devils’ shopping list is Everton star Jarrad Branthwaite, and one man who is a big fan is Jamie Carragher. \"I think he is [special],\" the ex-Liverpool star said.",
      "\"And what is really special as well is the amount of centre-backs we have in the Premier League aged 21 or younger. I remember being a young lad going in myself at Liverpool and it's an unforgiven position, I had to go to full-back for the next three or four years and then go back to centre-back, so you can see the quality we have.",
      "\"Branthwaite has been outstanding, Murillo [of Nottingham Forest] I think has been outstanding. But I think this lad [Branthwaite] has been pretty special and he's a big part of why, in my eyes, Everton still have a great chance of staying up; him and his partnership with [James] Tarkowski.\"",
      "While Branthwaite could potentially become a Red Devil this summer, one man who also looks set to return is youngster Hannibal Mejbri. The Tunisian joined Sevilla on loan in the January transfer window with the option of a permanent move.",
      "However, according to reports in Spain, a deal is already 'doomed'. Sevilla are not convinced he has shown enough to justify them activating their €17m (£14.5m) clause. Meanwhile, there have also been concerns about his behaviour. Mejbri’s contract at Old Trafford is set to run until the summer of 2025.",
      "Having already been sold by the Red Devils, James Garner could soon make them regret their decision. According to reports, the Red Devils academy graduate is potentially in line for an England call-up.",
      "It is suggested that Gareth Southgate is keeping tabs on the midfielder after being left concerned with Kalvin Phillips' recent form. The Red Devils sold Garner to Everton for a fee potentially rising to £15m in 2022.",
      "He is not the only one who could earn a call-up for March’s friendlies against Brazil and Belgium. It is suggested that Man United star Kobbie Mainoo and Fulham's Harrison Reed are also in the running.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has officially taken over sporting control of Manchester United, but he already faces a potential problem due to his ownership of French side Nice",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe may have to surrender control of Nice in order to avoid scuppering Manchester United ’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Ratcliffe’s takeover of United was finally made official on Tuesday night – and while the news was celebrated by his INEOS team, it also raised some serious questions. Although the Glazer family remain majority owners of United, Ratcliffe’s 25 per cent stake has bought him sporting control of his boyhood club.",
      "That could put him in breach of UEFA’s rules around multi-club ownership, given one of his other sides, Nice, are also hoping to compete in the Champions League next season. Nice, who have been owned by INEOS since August 2019, are currently third in Ligue 1 – three places higher than United sit in the Premier League, despite four straight wins.",
      "UEFA’s rules state that if both United and Nice were to qualify for the Champions League next season, then the team who finished higher in their league would take the spot in the competition, while the other would be barred. That means that United could close the five-point gap to fourth place, only to miss out on qualification due to their new owner's other business interests.",
      "However, The Telegraph reports that petrochemicals billionaire Ratcliffe would consider relinquishing control of the French side in order to focus on United. Doing so would avoid a potential conflict of interest in European competitions, with UEFA’s rules stating the same owner or entity is not permitted to have “decisive influence” across two or more clubs.",
      "Ratcliffe is the majority shareholder at Nice, but is already taking a back seat there to focus on United instead. While he will reportedly seek clarification from UEFA first, the 71-year-old would be willing to let Nice become a ‘stand-alone’ entity in the INEOS group, which also includes Swiss club Lausanne.",
      "Attention has already switched from the south of France to Manchester, with director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford working at United since January and playing a key role in staff recruitment. After hiring Omar Berrada from Manchester City to become the new chief executive, United are pushing to get Dan Ashworth from Newcastle as their sporting director.",
      "Speaking after the completion was announced on Tuesday evening, Ratcliffe said: \"To become co-owner of Manchester United is a great honour and comes with great responsibility. This marks the completion of the transaction, but just the beginning of our journey to take Manchester United back to the top of English, European and world football, with world-class facilities for our fans. Work to achieve those objectives will accelerate from today.”",

      "Marcus Rashford has been encouraged to stay at Manchester United by Red Devils legend Dwight Yorke, who feels the England international will find his form soon.",
      "After a sensational season in front of goal last term, Rashford has found goals harder to come by during the current campaign. Factor that alongside how United as a collective have struggled so far and the rumours regarding the forward's long-term future were almost inevitable.",
      "The Red Devils academy graduate is the highest-paid player within the current crop of Old Trafford stars, but has recently been the subject of speculation linking him with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, as the Ligue 1 titans prowl the market for a Kylian Mbappe replacement ahead of his expected switch to Real Madrid.",
      "However, the Parisians aren't the only ones who have been touted with a pursuit for Rashford. United's Premier League rivals Arsenal are keen on adding another attacker and are reportedly mulling over a shock move for the 26-year-old.",
      "With that being said, United icon Yorke has made clear Rashford should steer clear of heading for the Old Trafford exit any time soon. The three-time Premier League winner told GamblingZone he feels joining a new side is hardly going to bring the best out of a player who has struggled for consistency this term.",
      "\"Rashford to Arsenal? I think that’d be a foolish move,\" Yorke claimed. \"Yes, people may think he wants to leave, but for what reason? He’s just signed a new contract and he’s easily, in my opinion, one of the best players at Manchester United.",
      "\"Of course, because of the level he reached last season he hasn’t been able to fulfil his potential. As sportsmen you go through phases and I think he will come out on the right side of it. With any sportsman, including Rashford, if you’re not happy at work you won’t have a good time.",
      "\"Rashford needs to be happy with his surroundings, in training, to perform the way we know he’s capable of doing. We don’t know the ins and outs, there’s lots of speculation that he’s not happy, but he may be happy and just out of form. I don’t really take too much notice when you hear everybody’s opinions, but I think Rashford is in the right place\"",

      "Rebuild or renovate is the pressing question with Old Trafford, Man Utd's 114-year-old stadium that has been neglected.",
      "New Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe insists it is a \"no-brainer\" to rebuild Old Trafford, which he has described as \"run down\" and \"neglected\".",
      "The Manchester Evening News reported earlier this month United could rebuild Old Trafford without temporarily relocating and that the club has been advised that is the best option.",
      "A renovation of the 114-year-old stadium is understood to be complicated due to the railway line behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand and Old Trafford's existing structures. Although sources have suggested enhancing the stadium would be more cost-efficient than rebuilding it, the expense would still be considerable and more time-consuming.",
      "United would also be hit by reduced capacity crowds, as they were when the north stand, now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, was rebuilt in 1995.",
      "A new Old Trafford would be a higher capital cost but provide a better return on the investment and could be constructed while Old Trafford is still in use, as Tottenham did with White Hart Lane while their new stadium was under construction next door.",
      "Spurs moved into the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March 2019, having played home games at Wembley for nearly two years amid delays to their new home's construction.",
      "\"In an ideal world, I think it's a no-brainer,\" Ratcliffe told the Manchester Evening News. \"In an ideal world, you want a stadium in the north, a stadium of the north, which would be a world-class stadium where England could play and you could have the FA Cup Final and it's not all centred around the south of England.",
      "\"So in an ideal world, absolutely, that's where I would be but you've got to be practical about life.",
      "\"You have to think practically because money doesn't grow on trees, obviously. The two most talked-about issues at Manchester United are number one: the football, the performance on the pitch, and the second one is the stadium.",
      "\"What we can see so far - we haven't had much time - what we've seen of the stadium so far: there is a really good case to refurbish Old Trafford, probably about £1billion in cost, or something like that.",
      "\"You finish up with a great stadium, it's probably an 80 or 90,000-seater. But it's not perfect because you're modifying a stadium that is slap bang up against a railway line and all that type of stuff, so it's not an ideal world. But you finish up with a very good answer.",
      "\"Manchester United needs a stadium befitting one of the biggest clubs in the world and at the moment, it's not there. Old Trafford maybe was 20 years ago but it's certainly not today.",
      "\"There's this wider conversation with the community as to whether you could use a more ambitious project on site as a catalyst to regenerate that Old Trafford area, which is quite an interesting area in a way because it was the heart of the Industrial Revolution, it is the oldest industrial park in Europe, it was the first industrial park in Europe. It's where the Industrial Revolution began. And it's still one of the biggest ones. And they obviously built the Manchester Ship Canal to service it. That's where all the coal came in, the cotton and that sort of stuff.",
      "\"And that's why they built Old Trafford there. People would finish their shift and then walk to the ground, there was no transport in those days. That's the history of why the club is there.",
      "\"But today it's a bit run-down and neglected in places, there's a strong case for using a stadium to regenerate that area, like with the Olympics, like Seb Coe did with that part of East London quite successfully. City have done it and they've done quite a good job.",
      "Ratcliffe outlined the case for a potential national stadium to rival Wembley that is based in the north. \"The people in the north pay their taxes like the people in the south pay their taxes,\" he stressed. \"But where's the national stadium for football? It's in the south? Where's the national stadium for rugby? It's in the south. Where's the national stadium for tennis? It's in the south. Where's the national concert stadium? It's the O2, it's in the south. Where's the Olympic Village? It's in the south.",
      "\"All of this talk about levelling up and the Northern Powerhouse. Where is the stadium in the north? How many Champions Leagues has the north-west won and how many Champions Leagues has London won? The answer to that is the north-west has won 10 - Liverpool have won more than us - and London has won two.",
      "\"Where do you have to go if you get to the semi-final of the FA Cup and you're a northern club? You have to schlepp down to London, don't you?",
      "\"So what happened to HS2, which was going to be a substantial amount of investment in the north, what happened to that? They cancelled that. And where are they going to spend that? They're going to spend it on the rail network in London.",
      "\"People in the north pay their taxes and there is an argument you could think about a more ambitious project in the north which would be fitting for England, for the Champions League final or the FA Cup final and acted as a catalyst to regenerate southern Manchester, which has got quite significant history in the UK.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has accused Newcastle United of behaving in a \"silly\" manner over their demands for sporting director Dan Ashworth.",
      "Ashworth has been placed on gardening leave amid his desire to become the inaugural sporting director at United and the club officially made an approach to Newcastle this week. Newcastle have touted a figure ranging between £10million to £20m for Ashworth, which has baffled figures at United, Ratcliffe included.",
      "It has also been suggested that Ashworth, who only joined Newcastle from Brighton less than two years ago, could serve gardening leave until 2026, which new United co-owner Ratcliffe branded \"absurd\" and \"stupid\".",
      "\"I think Dan Ashworth is clearly one of the top sporting directors in the world, I've no doubt,\" Ratcliffe told the Manchester Evening News and other journalists. \"He's a very capable person. He's interested in the Manchester United job because it's probably the biggest sporting director job in the world just now, with the biggest challenge.",
      "\"It would be different if you were the sporting director at Manchester City because you would just be maintaining a level, at Manchester United you've got quite a significant building job. I think he would be a very good addition to Manchester United but he needs to decide whether he's going to make that jump.",
      "\"We've obviously had words with Newcastle. They would clearly be disappointed to lose Dan.

      "\"But then you can't equally criticise Dan. It is a transient industry. It's not like my world of chemicals, nobody ever goes from DOW to Ineos, you stay where you are. Football is transient. But you would understand why Dan is interested. It's the ultimate challenge for a sporting director so we'll have to see how it unfolds.",
      "\"It's a bit silly, personally. I won't get dragged into that. What I do think is completely absurd is suggesting a man who is really good at his job sits in his garden for one-and-a-half years. That's completely stupid.\"",
      "Ratcliffe also spoke about the issue in relation to United's capture of Omar Berrada from Manchester City. Berrada left his role as chief football operations officer at City to take on the role of chief executive at United earlier this month.",
      "\"We had a very grown-up conversation with Manchester City about Omar. They were very, very disappointed in Omar's decision but Omar again went for the same reasons. But we had a very grown-up conversation with them and when things calmed down we sorted it out very amicably, really.",
      "\"At the end of the day, they could accept why Omar wanted to take on that challenge and they didn't want to stand in his way. And you look at Pep with his footballers: if he has a footballer who doesn't want to play for Manchester City, he says fine. He doesn't tell him to sit in a garden for one-and-a-half years. He doesn't do that.",

      "In October 2010, Rooney shocked United and the wider football community by submitting a transfer request following interest from Manchester City and several other clubs. The situation was resolved and Rooney signed a five-year deal but the 38-year-old has explained that losing both Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo the previous year made him question the club’s direction, which angered Ferguson.",
      "“[Gary Neville] brought up – just before [he] left [Manchester United] – in terms of how the club was going from a commercial point of view. You could see what was happening and then I started thinking about the team,” Rooney told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "“ Thinking, ‘Right, what’s happening with the team?’ ‘What’s going to happen with the manager because we knew he [Sir Alex Ferguson] didn’t have that long left.",
      "“The club offered me a new five-year deal but then we just sold [Carlos] Tevez, we just sold [Cristiano] Ronaldo and I said to the manager, ‘It’s no disrespect to Phil Jones or Chris Smalling – they are obviously not going to replace Ronaldo and Tevez and I just wanted assurances that it wasn’t going to be another transition.",
      "‌“I didn’t have the time personally, so I felt it was important to ask the question. Is it going to be a three, four-year transition, or is it going to be we’re going to win trophies now and he told me to get out of his office – so then I got more sense out of David Gill of what the plan was.”",
      "United had made four summer signings that season: Chris Smalling, Javier Hernandez, Bebe, and Marnick Vermijl. Phil Jones was signed from Blackburn Rovers the following year. Shortly after the fallout, United announced that Rooney had agreed to a fresh contract, days before his 25th birthday.",
      "Rooney also talked about Sir Alex Ferguson stepping down at United in 2013. The legendary manager was replaced first by David Moyes in 2013, and the end of an era at Old Trafford also saw a host of senior players instrumental to their success alos depart, replaced by a number of young players coming through the ranks.",
      "“Firstly, at Manchester United, we were losing the core of the team in Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidić, they were all on their last legs, so we were losing that presence in the changing room, which left me and Michael Carrick from our generation.,\" said Rooney. “Then you’ve got the likes of Jesse Lingard, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley coming through, who had good careers, but they weren’t the same as the core group we had.",
      "\"Football was changing, the behaviour of players and everything around football was changing and that was a big time. I remember after the Liverpool game when we got beat at Old Trafford in 2014 under David Moyes, the players were dancing around the changing room the next day at the training ground, playing hip hop music. I tried taking the speaker out the room and you can try to control as much as possible, but you can’t really.”",

      "Rooney handed in a shock transfer request under Sir Alex Ferguson but the hope is that such star Man United players will refrain from doing the same under Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is being seen as a new dawn at Old Trafford, albeit the presence of the Glazers still lingers in the background.",
      "INEOS has already made strides towards tightening the loose screws on the Manchester United wagon, and that might lead to some parts being replaced. United have done this before but with dire consequences.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson vacated the driver’s seat in 2013, no new appointment has been able to get the club over the title line. In terms of league position, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were the closest, albeit the former rather slammed the door on the way out.",
      "TAKEOVER: United baffled by Newcastle compensation claim for Dan Ashworth",
      "MOST READ: Casemiro dropped and Mount starts - United have a new-look midfield option",
      "With so many failed hirings, the fingers are now being pointed at the mechanics of the club. Former chief Ed Woodward has long gone and ex-CEO Richard Arnold stepped down from his role in September. Meanwhile, Director of Football John Murtough is likely to be replaced by Dan Ashowrth as sporting director.",
      "The biggest grievance at United, though, has been who is fuelling the trajectory of the club. Wayne Rooney highlighted his concern regarding investment from the Glazers upon handing in his transfer notice in 2010 following the sales of Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.",
      "He said: “You could see what was happening and then I started thinking about the team. Thinking, ‘Right, what’s happening with the team?’ ‘What’s going to happen with the manager because we knew he [Sir Alex] didn’t have that long left.",
      "‌“The club offered me a new five-year deal but then we just sold [Carlos] Tevez, we just sold [Cristiano] Ronaldo. I didn’t have the time personally, so I felt it was important to ask the question.",
      "“When I put the transfer request in [to leave Manchester United], I was still speaking to David Gill on where the club was going, how they were going to move forward. Being a manager now myself, and looking back, it was the wrong thing to do, probably.",
      "“At the time, I felt like it was the right thing to do to really get assurances for my own career. Once David [Gill] had explained what the club are doing, I said, ‘Fine – that’s all the manager had to say. That’s all the club had to tell me’, and then I signed the new deal.\"",
      "United will hope that Ratcliffe’s grip on the sporting side of matters at Old Trafford will mean players and fans will never have to worry about a lack of investment again - and perhaps more so allow them to have faith in who is managing the finances. The Glazers have allowed the club to spend a lot of money in recent years - more than £500m on transfers in the last three summers - but the problem has been who and what it has been spent on.",
      "Ratcliffe has so far shown his business acumen and seems to be installing the right mechanics to enable Erik ten Hag to drive faster. Perhaps the next question is whether the Dutchman is the right man to steer the club to another championship.",

      "Eric Ramsay, hailed by his former colleagues, could soon leave Manchester United amid reports linking him to a job in the USA.",
      "Manchester United coach Eric Ramsay has been been linked with a move to America.",
      "The Welshman is being linekd with taking charge of MLS side Minnesota United - and people who have worked with Ramsay believe he is not just an ordinary coach. He was born in Oswestry, near the Welsh border, and grew up in Llanfyllin, Wales.",
      "And when he couldn't become a professional football player, he turned his attention to coaching. His coaching journey has taken him from Loughborough to Swansea City, Shrewsbury, Chelsea, and Manchester United.",
      "Professor Chris Cushion first met Ramsay when he was studying for a degree Sport Science with Management at Loughborough and invited him to join the university football team's staff.",
      "Cushion used to be the assistant coach at Loughborough, and he had a great team of helpers. These included Ramsay, Kieran McKenna (who is now the boss of Ipswich Town) and Matt Prestridge (who is now a first-team coach at Watford).",
      "\"Loughborough is a really good place for players, but also coaches and analysts before entering the professional game and part of our role there was to bring in aspiring young coaches to work with the team,\" Cushion told the Manchester Evening News in 2023.",
      "\"We ran the team for three years and had our highest-ever non-league finish, we won one league cup, we were university champions and had a really successful period and we took on Kieran McKenna, Matt Prestridge and Eric for that role.",
      "\"We were really happy that those guys came on board. It was a mentoring opportunity and I know we're here to talk about Eric, but Kieran [McKenna] was an unbelievably good coach, even back then. He was probably one of the most talented kids I've seen.\"",
      "McKenna and Ramsay met again, years later, at United after spending time together at Loughborough. Ramsay got a big thumbs up from his old workmate and he joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's staff in July 2021.",
      "Solskjaer said the club was lucky to get Ramsay, who he called 'young, fresh and an innovative coach', to join. It was also confirmed that he would work with individuals and be in charge of set plays.",
      "Cushion said: \"It doesn't surprise me that all three of them [Ramsay, McKenna and Prestridge] have been successful in the professional game,\" Cushion added. \"I think the common trait they all share was that they have an unbelievable passion for the sport.",
      "\"Their desire to learn, just thinking about the game and coaching all the time. They all had great relationships with the players and were able to connect with the players in a really meaningful way. They built powerful connections.",
      "\"They were not only really, really good technically, but they had a real passion for it and they were students of the game. Eric is a really clever, switched-on guy, but he's able to communicate with players in an authentic way.",
      "\"There's a lot of intelligence behind there, but he doesn't talk down, he just communicates effectively and that's really important when you're coaching, as you need to pitch the message to the people who are standing in front of you.\"",
      "Ramsay, described as a 'family man' with a love for fitness, was able to build such connections at Loughborough due to his personality. Sources say he's also been able to establish a great rapport with players at Carrington.",
      "His immense dedication to his role as first-team coach at United, including working long hours, has been recognised by key figures. It's understood his fluency in Spanish has helped him build great relationships with players.",
      "Sources say Ramsay is great at being in charge but also friendly, and he makes training fun. He's really smart with tactics too, thanks to his time at Loughborough.",
      "\"At Loughborough, the coaching staff had different responsibilities for different aspects, whether that be the tactical game plan, preparation, or specific tactical pieces and we would subdivide the work,\" Cushion said.",
      "\"Some aspects of that, Eric would lead with and some he'd help with, but we were very tactically focused. As a university, we wanted to challenge the players and be very different, so we experimented and had a big tactical focus.",
      "\"I would say in terms of that tactical analysis, then putting that into training sessions is something he was very good at. I can remember when Eric was at Swansea, telling us their first-team didn't do as much tactical work as Loughborough.",
      "\"We played with lots of different tactical analysis and ways of playing, we were very different in the division and the training reflected that. I would say he picked up on that well, although he's got a good reputation for working with individual payers as well.",
      "\"That individual, technical development is something that he's grown to be good at. You need to have relationships with players for that, as they need to trust you and you must have something to offer. It's not about telling players, it's a dialogue.\"",
      "Cushion talked about the football tactics used at Loughborough and praised Ramsay's coaching methods. \"We were very possession-based, we played out from the back and played through the thirds,\" he explained.",
      "He also mentioned that they didn't always use a high press but looked for specific moments to apply pressure. He said: \"Not necessarily a high press, but looking for pressing triggers. We'd look for things that would trigger a press, so I would suggest he's a possession-based, ball-playing type of coach. I would say that style would please Eric Ramsay.\"",
      "Cushion believes Ramsay enjoys this kind of play, saying: \"I think that would be the type of football he'd want to see in his team. We still have chats now about stuff. At the level we were working at, he'd work on all of the units, so the defensive shape, the midfield and attacking players.\"",
      "Ramsay did well in his studies and quickly moved up in his coaching career. He got a first-class honours degree from Loughborough at 21 and soon became the youngest Under-18 coach in the Premier League with Swansea City.",
      "After working with Swansea's youth teams, Ramsay went back to his roots at Shrewsbury as head of academy and coaching.",
      "Despite being young, Ramsay has made a big impact in coaching. Cushion said: \"I think it's definitely been his underpinning understanding and knowledge of the game and a willingness to stay contemporary.",
      "\"He has the willingness to understand how the game evolves. He is clearly able to build relationships with players and the people around him. He's simply good at what he does and it's really interesting if you look at how Chelsea cherry-pick coaches.",
      "\"They kind of recruit by looking at who is doing a good job and that's basically what happened with Eric at Shrewsbury, they saw something in him, they knew he had potential. That doesn't happen unless you're good, to attract that kind of interest.\"",
      "Ramsay returned to Shrewsbury to oversee their academy, where he 'raised their youth system to a new level', but a year later, he was thrown into a first-team environment for the first time when the club sacked their manager in November 2018.",
      "After that sacking, Ramsay took joint-temporary charge of Shrewsbury for six games and he was retained after the permanent appointment of Sam Ricketts, who represented the likes of Swansea, Hull, Bolton and Wolves in his playing career.",
      "The transition was made easier by Ricketts already knowing Ramsay from studying for their UEFA Pro Licence together. \"Back then, my first impression of Eric was someone who was very articulate, a very good student,\" Ricketts told the MEN.",
      "\"He had a very good personality, someone who was keen to learn and who you'd be quite happy to sit down and chat with, which we did many times. It's funny because six months after we started the Pro Licence, I went to Shrewsbury where Eric was.",
      "\"I ended up working with him and when I arrived, he'd been in the academy and he was put in temporary charge as first-team coach. He was the caretaker manager because all the staff had gone, so he stepped up to take training.",
      "\"I already knew him and I kept him onboard, as a first-team coach. He had a good relationship with the players, they enjoyed his sessions, they were well-organised and thought out. They liked him as a person - there's really nothing to dislike about him.",
      "\"He's very good like that. During our time, I would coach the team as well as him, so we'd share elements of the session and it would be a collaboration. I'd say what I wanted to work on and he'd produce a session to run alongside that.",
      "\"He had great knowledge, good understanding and top sessions. When you're down at that level, the beauty of it is you don't have an abundance of staff, so Eric would have got involved in the analysis of the games, and reviews.\"",
      "Ramsay's communication skills impressed university staff during his time at Loughborough and Ricketts also agreed that his strong presence on the training ground helped make him a valued part of his backroom team at Shrewsbury.",
      "\"What stood out? His character, his personality, a good way about him and getting information across,\" Ricketts said. \"He had a good way of managing a session and knowing what we were looking to achieve from that particular training session.",
      "\"His tone of voice was good and he understood how we wanted the session to be intensity-wise. He's also got an amazing whistle and believe it or not, that's actually really good to have as a coach. He just has a really loud, sharp whistle.",
      "\"I know it sounds stupid, but it's something that is so simple, but very effective in gaining attention when you want it.",
      "\"We stayed up, the FA Cup run was good, as we beat some decent teams along the way,\" Ricketts added. \"Eric was very good and he did well that season, but when Chelsea came in, I actually thought it was a really good move for him.",
      "\"Going to a big club, it was good for his coaching career because he didn't have a playing background. I think it was great he came through Shrewsbury at that level and then to experience what a Premier League side and what a big club is like.",
      "\"It was a chance to see how it's run, with the different facets of staff and how that works, so I thought it was a really good move for him and I told him he should go and enjoy it. He would have gone anyways, to be fair, but it made sense for him.\"",
      "Ramsay was handpicked by Chelsea to become the assistant manager of their Under-23 team. After two years at Cobham, he moved up north to Manchester on McKenna's recommendation.",
      "Solskjaer brought Ramsay into his coaching team, but a few months later, Solskjaer was let go due to a series of poor results. Ralf Rangnick stepped in temporarily, and McKenna, Martyn Pert and Michael Carrick left the club.",
      "Ramsay stayed on as part of the coaching staff. It's believed that Rangnick didn't get too involved with set pieces during his time, leaving most of the training for these to Ramsay.",
      "The team's performance at set-pieces has been talked about a lot, but Ramsay's role has expanded since Ten Hag arrived. Ten Hag wanted Ramsay to stay on his team along with assistants Mitchell van der Gaag and Steve McClaren.",
      "Ramsay has now moved beyond his set-piece duties at the club. He's thought to have a broader role as a first-team coach, leading most training sessions alongside Van der Gaag and Darren Fletcher.",
      "Sources say Ramsay now plays a key role in getting the squad ready to win matches and has more responsibility in planning and running sessions. Ten Hag leads the group on tactics, and Ramsay is one of several coaches who reinforce his messages.",
      "The coaching process at Manchester United has been described as a 'team effort'. Ramsay, Van der Gaag, McClaren and Fletcher all work together at Carrington to help the club do well in the league.",
      "Ramsay isn't the only one in charge of set-pieces anymore. People say that Ten Hag is 'much more involved' with them. This has been helped by the recent hiring of a set-play analyst.",
      "All the coaches, not just Ramsay, work with the set-play analyst. But when Marcus Rashford scored from a clever corner routine against Nottingham Forest in December, Christian Eriksen said it was Ramsay's idea.",
      "Ramsay's importance at United was shown in January when Blackpool offered him a job as their permanent manager. People say that Ten Hag wanted him to stay, which was a big reason why he said no.",
      "Ramsay is liked and respected by the players. Ricketts thinks his ability to speak Spanish fluently has helped him do well at United. \"He's able to talk to the foreign lads in their native language and that is important,\" he added.",
      "\"You get players coming across that don't speak any English and he can interpret, or get his session across as well and speak to that player. It's one thing players speaking to players, but it's nice to be able to speak to the coaching staff as well.",
      "\"I think the first move was a good one, coming in as set-piece coach and gradually he's proved himself at Man United and his role has got bigger over time, which probably tells you more than anything that he's there learning and improving himself.\"",
      "When Manchester United won the Carabao Cup at Wembley in February, Ramsay couldn't hide his joy. It was his first ever trophy and soon after, he joined the Wales national team, achieving another dream.",
      "He said he 'feels at home' with the Welsh team and always wanted to be part of it. Ricketts thinks it makes sense for Ramsay, who grew up playing football in Wales before he became a coach.",
      "Ricketts explained: \"We did all of our coaching badges with the Welsh FA, so he's well known within the Welsh system for a number of reasons,\" and \"He's done plenty with the Welsh coaching system and it was just a natural progression for him.",
      "\"Welsh coaching badges are very good and, especially with a Welsh background and Eric ticked all of those boxes.\"",
      "It is believed that Ramsay asked Ten Hag and United if he could work with Wales. Now, he's like the assistant head coach for Wales, similar to Van der Gaag's job at United.",
      "Ramsay's new role with Wales has been described as 'really significant' by sources. Cushion, who spotted Ramsay's potential during his Loughborough days and still chats with him regularly, is thrilled with his progress.",
      "\"He's just a thoroughly nice young man,\" Cushion said. \"I know that sounds a bit cheesy, no one's going to say he's a complete w***** but he's not, he's a genuinely a great guy, he genuinely cares about others and I think he thoroughly deserves his success.\"",

      "“I just worry that if [Mainoo] was able to go and play and do well, are we going to put too much pressure on him? I do agree, in that position, apart from Rice, there’s probably nobody playing better so it is a bit of a conundrum.”",
      "Host Gary Lineker says Mainoo is “so impressive and mature” in his performances while fellow former England striker Alan Shearer added: “The way he’s come in and handled it so easily has to be a great positive to go against what Micah is saying [about pressure]. He has to be in [Southgate’s] thoughts.”"

      "Latest Manchester United news as Rasmus Hojlund continues to impress for Erik ten Hag's team",
      "Marcus Rashford has told Rasmus Hojlund to 'keep going' amid his goalscoring heroics for Manchester United.",
      "The Danish striker has been in fine form for Erik ten Hag's side, having become the youngest player in history to score in six consecutive Premier League games. Hojlund's double on Sunday against Luton Town also helped United to a fifth win in a row.",
      "It has been a remarkable transformation for the 21-year-old forward, who failed to score in his first 14 league games for United. Hoijlund arrived at Old Trafford last summer from Atalanta for £64million, although the fee could rise by a further £8m if certain clauses are met.",
      "And, after his brace against the Hatters that maintained United's top four push, the forward wrote on Instagram: \"Big win away from home. One step closer to Where we need to be!\" Fellow United forward Rashford responded to Hojlund's post, writing: \"Keep going bro.\"",
      "When discussing Hojlund's rise, Ten Hag said post Luton: \"We are very happy with our recruitment. That we recruited the right character because he can perform under stress. And when things go against him like in the first half of the season, he has the abilities to have a strong character, to be resilient, to be determined and to score goals and that is what we saw when we scouted him.",
      "\"Of course, he needed some support because it's not so easy when you're so young but, in general, he kept calm and you see his abilities.",
      "\"In the start, he didn't have so much luck. He scored some goals, for instance, the one against Brighton, his first [Premier League start], and they disallowed it and no one still knows why.",
      "\"There are moments that are very important in a new club and a new league, especially for a striker to build some confidence. That was not given but you see he is a fighter, he keeps going and he has great abilities in front of the goal.",
      "\"There are many ranges, areas, where he can improve but he has scoring abilities, that is clear. But what we have seen since September is he is improving in many other areas like holding up the ball.\"",

      "The latest Manchester United transfer gossip as we take a look at the rumours doing the rounds the last few days",
      "Manchester United are reportedly considering Atalanta midfielder Ederson as an option for Erik ten Hag in the summer.",
      "The Brazilian has impressed in Serie A this season and has been a key starter for Gian Piero Gasperini. According to One Football, five other English top-flight clubs are interested in the 24-year-old.",
      "In addition to United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle are all mentioned as interested parties in Ederson in the summer, while Juventus have been following him for some time. However, it is said that Atalanta will not entertain offers under the €40million (£34m) mark while the Italian outfit are in no urgent need to sell after cashing in £72m from the sale of Rasmus Hojlund last year.",
      "Speaking about the interest from clubs, Ederson told Globo: \"This topic always comes up. When the transfer window approaches, it's the same with the majority of players and it was no different with me. I think this time it was because I'm experiencing one of my best moments in my career at Atalanta today.",
      "\"It's something players talk about a lot but it's something that I've learned to leave to my agents, who will then pass it on to me, otherwise you are creating unnecessary hopes. Many things during the window, you don't know what is true and what is a lie, what could be happening.\"",
      "Elsewhere, United are said to be prepared to make an offer for Juventus defender Gleison Bremer in the summer. The Brazilian, 26, has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent weeks.",
      "United are understood to be planning a massive overhaul of players at the end of the season, while six players will also be out of contract. Raphael Varane is one of those players, while Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire could also be moved on.",
      "According to a new report by Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport, United see the Brazilian as a 'fundamental reinforcement' for next season. They add that a fee in excess of €60million (£51m) would be difficult for Juve to turn down.",
      "In addition, Get Football News claim that the Serie A giants have already started looking at potential replacements and the likes of Bologna’s Riccardo Calafiori, Atletico Madrid’s Reinildo Mandava, Bournemouth’s Llyod Kelly and Strahinja Pavlovic of Salzburg have been assessed as options.",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "However, this season saw Sancho make just three appearances for United under manager Erik ten Hag. The forward scored seven times in 41 appearances last season in Ten Hag's first campaign in charge of the Reds, but fell out of favour with the United boss this term and was banished from first-team duties.",
      "Sancho's last appearance for United came against Nottingham Forest at the end of August. Since his move to Dortmund, the 23-year-old has made six appearances for the Bundesliga club, including most recently against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.",

      "Kylian Mbappe has informed PSG that he will leave the French club this summer and he's expected to join Real Madrid.",
      "Football's worst-kept secret of the last few years is close to being made official.",
      "Kylian Mbappe is set to join Real Madrid after informing Paris Saint-Germain he will leave upon the expiry of his contract, meaning will become the most expensive 'free transfer' of all time. Although Mbappe will sign for Madrid on a free, barring a late hiccup in negotiations, he will receive a substantial signing-on fee, continue to be among the sport's highest earners and is likely to receive a portion of image rights, so the move is obviously lucrative.",
      "Madrid have chased Mbappe for years and it's just a surprise Los Blancos have taken this long to make a breakthrough, with the player flirting with a move away from Paris in each window. Now time has caught up to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Mbappe is the world's best player and the prospect of him playing in a team with Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior is frightening.",
      "Madrid should dominate La Liga and reach the latter stages of the Champions League almost every season for the next 10 years with that frontline. Mbappe's scheduled switch to the Bernabéu is already guaranteed to be the biggest football transfer of 2024 and it could have ramifications in the wider market this summer.",
      "PSG pay Mbappe an astronomical €200million (£171m) per year and that roughly equates to £19,000 per hour, or £316 per minute, so his removal from the wage bill will be significant. The Qatari-owned side are expected to make a splash in the market when Mbappe is removed from the books and Victor Osimhen and Marcus Rashford are thought to be on their shortlist.",
      "Rashford has long been admired by PSG and their president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, said in 2022: \"Rashford is amazing and for free? Every club will run after him. Definitely, we're not hiding it. We spoke before, was not a good moment for both sides. Maybe [in the summer]. Why not?\"",
      "Since that interview, Rashford has signed a new contract at United and he certainly won't be available for free this summer, but some have speculated an offer between £70m and £80m would be enough to tempt the Reds into a sale of the player who has become their poster boy.",
      "Rashford is an academy graduate, the highest-profile United success story of the last decade. He was born in Wythenshawe and supported the club growing up. Naturally, he has become the face of United, but his form has dropped this season and there have been discipline issues that have tested the patience of Erik ten Hag.",
      "It's not a good look to regress after signing a new deal, but Rashford's dip shouldn't be a surprise given he's struggled for consistency throughout his career. Unfortunately, a sudden loss of form is nothing new and it's why he's failed to bridge the gap to being a world-class talent.",
      "Rashford seems to have an excellent season followed by a disappointing campaign and he's now splitting opinion among supporters, who are wondering whether it might be best for him to leave. To some extent, Rashford is a victim of his success because the standards he's held to are higher than most in the squad, but it's frustrating watching a player capable of brilliance producing mediocre displays.",
      "His re-sale value is high and, as an academy graduate, his departure would bring huge relief to financial fair play restrictions, which is another reason his exit could be considered. Rashford would inevitably succeed in Ligue 1 and the scrutiny would not be as high. Depending on how he performs from now until the end of the season, he might also consider the move.",
      "Nonetheless, the odds are Rashford will likely stay at Old Trafford and strive toward bouncing back next season. United is his home, although sometimes you are forced to fly the nest.",

      "Mason Greenwood faces an uncertain future after his loan from Man United to Getafe expires in the summer he continues to attract transfer interest from Spain",
      "Manchester United have reportedly set a price tag of €40million on Mason Greenwood with a Dutch agent is keen to take him onto his books.",
      "The 22-year-old, who is currently playing for La Liga outfit Getafe, is expected to leave United at the end of his loan spell in Spain. Sport1 journalist Christopher Michel provided an update on Greenwood's future, and said: \"There will be no return to Manchester United. He is currently playing for FC Getafe and is convinced there. Atletico Madrid and FC Barcelona show interest. United hopes for a transfer fee of €40million (£34m) Contract until 2025.\"",
      "Last week, the Getafe loanee was offered the services of a new agent. Greenwood is currently represented by family members, with father Andrew understood to be in charge of contract discussions. But putting a high-profile transfer in place in the summer will require plenty of work from those off the field.",
      "Dutch agent Menno Groenveld has made the forward aware that he would be willing to step in and help. \"That’s a player that suits my agency, I think,\" Groenveld told Voetbal Primeur.",
      "\"I think he is a top player, although you cannot sit back with him. You have to get to work. Of course, a lot has happened but, with a player like that, you can still make a difference. Then my input is also worth something.\"",
      "Greenwood was suspended by United in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. A lengthy investigation into the case then followed, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropping all charges against Greenwood in February 2023.",
      "A United statement at the time read: \"Manchester United notes the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service that all charges against Mason Greenwood have been dropped. The club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps. We will not make any further comment until that process is complete.\"",
      "Greenwood left United for Getafe on loan following the conclusion of that internal investigation last year.",

      "Man United secured another Premier League win at the weekend but it wasn't a straightforward contest against Luton Town.",
      "\"I think it's too quick to say we've turned a corner,\" said Erik ten Hag before Manchester United's win against Luton Town at Kenilworth Road on Sunday.",
      "\"We're not there yet. We're back in the race but this club as a minimum wants to be in the top four, as a minimum. But I feel we're now heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's brace ensured a 2-1 victory over Luton and the win closed the gap to Tottenham to just three points. It also meant United are undefeated in their seven games in 2024 and, remarkably, they have a positive goal difference for the first time in six months.",
      "Ten Hag was right to suggest United are heading in the right direction again after a dreadful first half of the season, which saw immense pressure build on his position.",
      "There was no appetite from the club or supporters to see Ten Hag lose his job, but results were not good enough and, crucially, the performances were the main cause for concern.",
      "There were accusations about the team's lack of style and identity, but putting points on the board has quietened that conversation and United have gained momentum in the last few weeks.",
      "They seem to be peaking as the business stage of the season approaches and are five points behind the Champions League places. Many did not give United a chance of finishing in the top four after such a dismal start but the odds have shortened after each win.",
      "At the beginning of the season, Luton were the favourites to be relegated, but they recruited shrewdly and the charming Kenilworth Road has become a difficult place to visit.",
      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal have all been challenged when playing at Kenilworth Road and that is why last weekend's win cannot be sniffed at, regardless of how it unfolded.",
      "However, there were a few shaky moments in the game for United and they lacked control again. Kobbie Mainoo played with the most composure of any player in a white away shirt and although he is a special talent, an 18-year-old shouldn't be the one with the calmest head.",
      "Luton finished the game with 59 per cent possession and that is just the fourth time they've had more of the ball than the opposition when playing at home this season.",
      "After taking a two-goal lead, United should have coasted to victory, but the game became chaotic instead and that problem is certainly not exclusive to Sunday's performance. United have surrendered two-goal leads on far too many occasions this season.",
      "Ten Hag suggested results would improve when key players returned from injury and they have. He also said performances would improve but the lack of control has not been fixed.",
      "United have a habit of making games into a contest when they don't have to be. There is enough quality on the pitch to control proceedings and to make the opposition chase the ball.",
      "Finally, the team is heading in the right direction again but there is still plenty to improve.",

      "Man United's pursuit of Dan Ashworth deserves enormous credit, and it could be worth every penny if it means completing their new-look structure.",
      "The speed at which Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trying to implement sweeping changes at Manchester United is as admirable as it is ambitious.",
      "Just over eight weeks since United confirmed they had reached an agreement for the Ineos chief to secure a 25 per cent stake in the club, Ratcliffe has already taken Omar Berrada from Manchester City and put the wheels in motion to try and transform Old Trafford.",
      "Berrada's appointment as chief executive on January 20 was a statement of intent from the Failsworth-born billionaire. Though he has only acquired a 25 per cent stake from the Glazers, he is in no mood to take a reserved approach. He wants to make game-changing alterations.",
      "Taking control of football operations at Old Trafford was a key agreement in Ineos' plans. Their experience in sport, both in football and elsewhere, has the potential to stand United in good stead moving forward.",
      "Appointing Berrada sent out a statement. Ineos now want to send out an even bigger statement by appointing Dan Ashworth.",
      "Yesterday, Newcastle United announced they had put Ashworth on gardening leave after he informed them of his desire to join United. The Manchester Evening News revealed last week that the 52-year-old was as keen on United as they are on him.",
      "It has been reported elsewhere United must stump up £20million in compensation to appoint Ashworth now, or risk being made to wait until 2026 before being able to add him to the top table at Old Trafford. It is an eye-watering fee, but it is one United may have to cough up if Ratcliffe's grand plan is to take flight as soon as possible.",
      "Nowadays, £20m for a player, certainly for Premier League clubs, is a relatively low fee. It is not a fee that turns heads in amazement.",
      "Potentially spending £20m on a non-playing member of staff, though, would leave people scratching their heads and most probably pointing the finger and mocking. United have been laughed at on plenty of occasions in recent years when it has come to signing players for extravagant fees.",
      "Splashing out extravagant fees on average players is a trend United need to try and free themselves of this summer. It is hoped Ineos' new-look sporting structure will help the club avoid recruitment mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "Ashworth would be a major cog in the makeup of the new hierarchy. He is experienced in the recruitment world.",
      "If not in place ahead of this summer's transfer window, United would be missing a key part of the jigsaw. Ineos have sounded him out as their top candidate to fill the void of sporting director and they should not switch targets because of Newcastle's reported demands.",
      "Ashworth is one of the best in the business and Ineos know that. He has the potential to play a key role in their plans to bring the good times back to M16.",
      "With that said, a £20m fee could turn out to be a price worth paying. Having worked at Brighton, where smart and sensible recruitment has been their bread and butter, Ashworth knows his stuff.",
      "The role of a sporting director is a significant one in the landscape of any club's vision. It is a role that carries great responsibilities, but one that is crucial to the functioning of a club, certainly one of United's stature.",
      "After years of mismanagement under the Glazers, Ratcliffe is stamping his authority on proceedings, making decisions that should have been made a long time ago. In the space of eight weeks, United's football structure has gone from looking hopeless to potentially razor-sharp.",
      "With this forthcoming summer's transfer window marking a significant one in United's future, as well as the first of the Ratcliffe era, the club needs to be as well equipped for it as possible, even if that means making a significant investment in an off-field appointment.",
      "In the long run, it could be one of the wisest decisions the club makes in years, even if it risks denting their summer budget to strengthen the squad.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson always wanted to add David Hirst to his Man United squad - but he was up against a stubborn Trevor Francis who was not prepared to back down.",
      "It was on September 16, 1996, when David Hirst wrote his name into the Premier League history books - but not quite in a way that most other players envision leaving a lasting legacy.",
      "The former Sheffield Wednesday striker set the record for the hardest shot ever recorded in the Premier League era during a 4-1 defeat to Arsenal at Highbury. Striking the ball with what was once described by a former teammate as a 'sledgehammer of a left foot', Hirst struck a shot against the crossbar at an unimaginable speed of 114mph, leaving Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman rooted to the spot.",
      "Had it gone in, instead of bouncing down and away to safety, it would have been remembered even more vividly than those of just a Wednesday persuasion. But had Hirst had his way, he could have been shooting with his 'sledgehammer of a left foot' in the red of Manchester United, instead of the blue and white stripes of Wednesday on the other side of the Pennines.",
      "Such was the impression he was making in South Yorkshire, former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, after being turned down by Alan Shearer for the first time in 1992, turned his attention to Hirst, highlighting him as the perfect candidate to bolster United's forward line. At the time, Hirst, who scored 128 goals in 358 appearances for Wednesday, was banging the goals in for fun, scoring 20 in 37 games for the Owls during the 1991/92 campaign, fresh from their promotion from the old Division Two and a League Cup final success over United in 1990/91.",
      "Ferguson was understood to be an admirer of the Barnsley-born striker, so much so that he later admitted that was 'even keener' on signing Hirst than he was Shearer. In the end, United signed Eric Cantona, landing him in November 1992, signalling the end of United's striker hunt... or so everyone thought. United ended up persisting with their interest in Hirst and later tabled a £4.5million bid.",
      "Wednesday manager Trevor Francis stood firm, rejecting any advances United made for his star man, who spent 11 years at Hillsborough before moving to Southampton in 1997. A failed move to Old Trafford infuriated Hirst so much that he described it as the only regret he had during his career.",
      "\"I'd been talking to Alex Ferguson for a couple of weeks and I was going to Man United,\" Hirst said in an interview with the Mail. \"A fax was sent with an offer of £4.5million and I was expecting Trevor to say: 'Man United, £4.5million, away you go.' But he said, 'I'm not selling you.'",
      "\"One thing I never did in my career was knock on the manager's door because I'm not in the team or I want more money. If you're not happy with the contract, don't sign it.",
      "\"If you're not in the team, go out on the training ground and do your best. It's no good knocking on the door telling him what a good player you are if you've not been doing it. I never had a problem with that.",
      "\"Sitting here now, I should've banged the door down. It's orchestrated now and if Man United are interested your agent will get you there by hook or by crook.",
      "\"Financially, it wouldn't have been much different. We weren't on £50,000 a week then. We were all on pretty much the same. I was playing for Sheffield Wednesday, third in the league, in Europe, cup finals, good wages, but a Man United player comes with a different tag. It is the one thing I regret.\"",
      "Rumour has it, Ferguson tried to sign Hirst on no fewer than six occasions, such was his obsession with the striker, who would have easily become the face of England's forward line had it not been for a career that was so heavily plagued by injury issues. The former Owls star was fast, strong, dominant in the air and an all-round nightmare for opposing defenders. Wednesday fans idolised him and still consider him as their greatest-ever goal-getter.",
      "Had he have been granted his wish and Francis caved to Ferguson's demands, Hirst could have become a star in United colours, such was the progress the club was making under Ferguson in the '90s. They were adding to their trophy cabinet at a rapid rate and it is possible that they could have won more with a striker of Hirst's predatory instincts inside the 18-yard box.",
      "Francis later gave a detailed account of Ferguson's pursuit of Hirst in his autobiography 'One In A Million', which was released back in 2019.",
      "He wrote: \"Manchester United were following David for a while when Alex Ferguson was manager and I can still hear Alex now on my car phone totally exasperated with me because he had put in two offers which I had knocked back.",
      "\"He then offered £4million and with the 100 per cent backing of the board I told him we were not interested in doing anything with David Hirst. I refused £4million and Alex bellowed down the phone in his Scottish accent, ‘Do you realise this is Manchester United Football Club and you are stopping a player from going to Man United?'",
      "\"I told him that Sheffield Wednesday were a big club, not as big as Man United, and that I was looking to continue the improvements I was making and David Hirst was a big part of my plans. I stuck to my guns but I will never forget Alex Ferguson telling me what he thought of me!",
      "\"I was on the M1 motorway and he was not aware that Helen [Francis' wife] was in the car listening to him on the speakerphone. If she had been a referee he would undoubtedly have been given a red card for his bad language!\"",
      "It was, in the end, somewhat fitting that Hirst tormented United more than most clubs. He scored seven goals against them in his career - a record that he failed to better against anyone else.",
      "Such was Ferguson's relentless pursuit of the striker, he must still be wondering how many goals Hirst would have scored for United had he been able to get his man. Hirst must still wonder how his Premier League career would have taken off if he had made the move.",
      "It will go down as one of those 'what if' moments in the history of failed football transfers. But make no mistake about it, Ferguson wanted Hirst and he did everything within his powers to get him, even if it did not prove to be enough.",

      "United identified Ashworth as the number one candidate for the inaugural sporting director role at Old Trafford. The 52-year-old has held the same position at Newcastle since 2022 but is understood to have expressed a desire to make the switch to Manchester.",
      "Newcastle announced on Monday that the club had placed Ashworth on gardening leave after expressing a desire to leave the club. The news means that Ashworth moved a step closer to becoming the sporting director at United, but it's understood that he will serve a lengthy gardening leave that could be at least 12 months beforehand.",
      "United are yet to agree on compensation for Newcastle for their sporting director who only joined the club from Brighton last that two years ago. Ashworth has previously worked at West Brom and the FA, where he worked as technical director at the latter from 2012-18.",
      "It was during his time at the FA that Neville had first-hand experience of working alongside Ashworth. The United legend was an assistant coach to England manager Roy Hodgson from 2012-16 and has explained the impact of the changes that Ashworth put in place behind the scenes.",
      "“Dan Ashworth did a good job at West Brom, but I was there with England when he was appointed, and it was a big change when he came in,\" Neville said on Sky Sports' Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"It was quite a jolt at the time for Roy Hodgson to have a technical director like Dan Ashworth, who then brought in Dave Reddin who was a performance director. This was then they started talking about different types of coaches (e.g. attacking and defending coaches), and they were talking about attacking set piece coaches, breaking the game down to intimate detail, which was something Roy wasn’t used to.",
      "“I remember Dan [Ashworth] having a conversation with Roy [Hodgson], but they were building all these foundations, where he started with the U21’s, the U18’s and with the women’s team. You think of the success of all those teams in recent years, but that has been in the making for eight years, and it all started when Dan came in.",
      "“I’m not saying he’s responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA. They were a terrible organisation from a professionalism point of view, and I felt what he did, he put processes in place where they’re now structured and organised.”",

      "The academy has come to the rescue of Man United again this season and two graduates are frontrunners for the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "During the warm-up at Luton, some of Kobbie Mainoo's teammates deliberately overhit ground passes. Every time, he cushioned the ball back to them.",
      "Mainoo then attempted to playfully dribble the ball through the legs of Jonny Evans, a teammate twice his age. Mainoo is so unflustered it belies the age of someone who could be in their first year at university. Like students, he is partial to having some fun.",
      "The 18-year-old's footwork belongs on the Blackpool Ballroom as much as a football pitch. More than once, Mainoo's shimmies drew 'ooh's from the home supporters in the main stand.",
      "\"Kobbie was very mature and I think he is progressing from game to game,\" Erik ten Hag said. \"Hopefully, the process will keep going on.\"",
      "Mature is the key word. Mainoo has experienced atmospheres ranging from frenzied to febrile - Goodison Park, Istanbul, St James' Park, Anfield, Kenilworth Road - and passed almost every test.",
      "Sunday was Mainoo's 18th appearance for United and already teammates need to watch and learn from him. Watching Mainoo at Luton, it was difficult not to recall Ten Hag's constructive criticism at Villa Park seven days earlier.",
      "\"We went in every situation for goal, instead of keeping the ball,\" he lamented. \"We are 1-0 up and when you can't go for goal, recognise the situation, make decisions, keep the ball, drag them out and find the right moment to speed up. Clever players, they read the game.\"",
      "Mainoo is very clever. He recognises and reads situations, keeps the ball, lures players in and times his passes expertly. He is yet to exhibit the passing range of Paul Scholes yet is more fleet of foot and can tackle cleanly, as he demonstrated on Jordan Clark. He was erroneously penalised and yellow-carded.",
      "The more Mainoo plays, the more redundant Mason Mount becomes as a central midfielder at United. The midfielder United recruit to complement Mainoo will be their most vital piece of business in the summer and it is ironic Mount's United career began next to Mainoo in a pre-season friendly against Leeds United in Oslo. Mainoo has already usurped him.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was not as effervescent as his academy teammate against Luton. Most of the United front six had off-days and Garnacho continues to crumble rather than remain composed in one-on-ones. Luton can be added to the list with Burnley, Leeds, Liverpool and West Ham.",
      "Garnacho is still only 19. Cristiano Ronaldo was so dismayed at his impotence in front of goal at that age for United he refused to celebrate when he broke his duck in the 2004-05 season. It was December.",
      "Ronaldo never got close to starting in 21 consecutive matches as a teenager for United, as Garnacho has. The longest starting run Ronaldo had was eight games and the last, against Birmingham City, fell on his 20th birthday.",
      "Garnacho now occupies the right flank, as Ronaldo did back then. He got two goals against Aston Villa and another two against West Ham 40 days later. That is as many Premier League goals as Antony has managed in almost 18 months.",
      "Antony and Mount could cost United a combined £146.3million. Mount may get another season to prove he is no write-off but Antony is. Ten Hag has granted him two minutes of playing time since he jeopardised United's lead against Wolves at the start of the month.",
      "Neither are among the \"15 or 16 players\" Ten Hag referred to as members of his core squad. Mount and United always felt a mismatch and he would have been better suited to Liverpool or Arsenal, other clubs with concrete interest.",
      "Jurgen Klopp touched base with Mount in January last year and Mikel Arteta was reputedly telling confidants a deal was all but done. United are still adamant they saved £10m on Mount, bought for £55m and £5m in add-ons.",
      "So far, Mount has played 12 times, notched one assist in a League Cup tie and no goals. He was moved from midfield to the right-hand side against Brentford in October, flopped and was dropped. He has not had a single England call-up as a United player and has been sidelined for four months of the campaign through hamstring and calf injuries.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, bred in the academy, are the poster boys of the new United. Mount and Antony epitomise the club's continued knack for frittering hundreds of millions in the transfer market. There is a reason why Ineos settled on Dan Ashworth as United's inaugural sporting director.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has spoken about how his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson changed after handing in a transfer request",
      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has opened up about the impact that submitting a transfer request had on his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Rooney ended his United career as the club’s all-time top goalscorer, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League in his 13 years at Old Trafford. During one of the most successful periods in the club’s history, at one point, Rooney formed part of a formidable front three alongside Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "However, after seeing both his strike partners leave the previous year, Rooney shocked the footballing world by submitting a transfer request amid interest from rivals Manchester City in October 2010. Rooney would eventually sign a new five-year deal but the United icon admits that his decision to call for a move permanently changed the dynamic between himself and Ferguson.",
      "READ MORE; Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho are highlighting Manchester United’s biggest strength and biggest weakness",
      "“It was 2010 [when I asked for a transfer]. It wasn’t Manchester City – it was more I wanted answers,” Rooney explained on the Stick to Football podcast. “There were a few teams asking – there was Real Madrid, Barcelona was asking, City were asking, Chelsea were asking.",
      "“I genuinely wanted to stay [at Manchester United] but there was a clash of me and the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] as well, and once you try and disagree with him, he doesn’t take it lightly. My relationship with the manager after that moment was never the same.”",
      "Rooney explained that he had noticed a change to United’s approach in the transfer market and that the club appeared to be in transition after losing Ronaldo and Tevez; bringing in young prospects such as Chris Smalling and Javier Hernandez rather than high-profile stars. Gary Neville recalled that he and Ryan Giiggs had advised Rooney to apologise to the United squad, which he did, but the Sky Sports pundit was still left baffled that the forward managed to agree to a new contract after speaking out against the club.",
      "Providing further clarity on the situation, Rooney added: “When I put the transfer request in [to leave Manchester United], I was still speaking to David Gill on where the club was going, how they were going to move forward. Being a manager now myself, and looking back, it was the wrong thing to do probably. At the time, I felt like it was the right thing to do to really get assurances for my own career.",
      "‌“Once David Gill had explained what the club are doing, I said, ‘Fine – that’s all the manager had to say. That’s all the club had to tell me’, and then I signed the new deal.",
      "“In terms of the relationship with the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson], of course it was never the same. After that, the big thing that probably hurt him was they had just sold Carlos Tevez, they had just sold Cristiano Ronaldo, and probably couldn’t afford to let me go.”",

      "SEC filings show that Sir Jim Ratcliffe had been prepared to walk away from deal by Christmas Day",
      "As Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment in Manchester United was confirmed tonight, revealing documents show how he was ready to walk away from the deal just days before it was agreed.",
      "Ratcliffe has bought 25% of the Class A shares through the tender offer and 25% of the Class B shares from the Glazer family. Further shares have been issued in return for the initial $200million capital investment made by Ratcliffe, taking his total ownership to 27.7%. A further $100m will be invested by Ratcliffe by December 31, when his ownership will increase to 28.9%.",
      "While the Glazer family retains overall control of the football club, the arrival of Ratcliffe and the minds that spearhead his sporting assets with INEOS has been welcomed in bringing about the hope of some strategic change to go about rebuilding the club on the pitch and returning it to a position of title challengers on a regular basis.",
      "But while the deal arrived on Christmas Eve, Ratcliffe had, as revealed in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings in New York made public on Wednesday, been ready to walk away by Christmas Day if an agreement wasn’t reached by shareholders.",
      "After Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, Ratcliffe’s main bidding rival, withdrew from the process in October, the 71-year-old was effectively the only show in town for United if they wanted to get a deal done, having gone back and forth over an agreement for a year. Sheikh Jassim was revealed in the filings to have failed to produce the requested commitment of funds at any stage.",
      "In a critical 48 hours for the deal, SEC filings showed that United held an informal board meeting on December 22 where what were described as “robust” discussions were had over the proposal from Ratcliffe and his threat to walk away from the deal if its terms were not accepted.",
      "The SEC documents noted that the offeror (Ratcliffe) “was not prepared to accept any other changes proposed by the non-affiliated directors, and gave Manchester United a deadline of December 25, 2023, to accept its best and final proposal”.",
      "Ratcliffe’s October offer of $33 per share for both Class A and Class B shares, with Class B shares carrying greater voting privileges, came some months after the opening February offer seeking a controlling stake via the proposed purchase of Class B shares at $22 per share.",
      "Ratcliffe had upped his offer to $33 per share for Class B shares in May, still at the time seeking majority control.",
      "However, in July, engaged with Manchester United representatives, the investment bank Raine Group, regarding an alternative transaction structure which would see him take a minority stake instead. The proposal, according to the filings, saw Ratcliffe want to “purchase 25 per cent of all outstanding Class B Shares for a price of $33.00 per share and 25 per cent of all outstanding Class A Shares at a price to be determined, together with associated minority shareholder protections and governance rights”.",
      "This was the offer that remained in place until October when they returned to the negotiating table, with Ratcliffe submitting a fresh proposal on October 13 that included buying up to 25 per cent of all outstanding Class A shares through a public tender at a price of $33 per share. He would also complete a “direct purchase” of all outstanding Class B Shares of existing Class B shareholders at a price of $33 per share.",
      "Deliberations continued for United shareholders with little movement through November and early December, prompting Ratcliffe to try to get a decision reached by providing the Christmas Day ultimatum.",
      "Having held the informal board meeting on December 22, by Christmas Eve a full board meeting was in session where the decision was taken to vote through the proposal of Ratcliffe and INEOS for a sale of 25 per cent of the club, with oversight of footballing operations included.",
      "It is a deal that Ratcliffe and INEOS remain unable to go into great detail on just yet due to the fact that regulatory approval from the Premier League is required. That is, however, expected to be a formality and could arrive before the end of January.",

      "Jarrad Branthwaite is reported to be on Manchester United's six-man transfer shortlist, with the Red Devils weighing up a £75million summer swoop for the Everton defender",
      "Jamie Carragher has praised Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite - who is a reported transfer target for Manchester United.",
      "The 21-year-old defender is enjoying an impressive season with Everton after spending last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven under the guidance of ex-United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. Now, it has been claimed in the Daily Mail that he's on Manchester United's shortlist for transfers, with Tottenham and Real Madrid also said to be showing interest with Everton reportedly ready to demand £75m for the defender.",
      "Carragher, who played over 700 times for Liverpool, spoke highly of Branthwaite on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football before Everton's 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace. He described Branthwaite as \"special.\"",
      "\"I think he is,\" Carragher said again. \"And what is really special as well is the amount of centre-backs we have in the Premier League aged 21 or younger.",
      "\"I remember being a young lad going in myself at Liverpool and it's an unforgiven position, I had to go to full-back for the next three or four years and then go back to centre-back, so you can see the quality we have.",
      "\"Branthwaite has been outstanding, Murillo [of Nottingham Forest] I think has been outstanding. But I think this lad [Branthwaite] has been pretty special and he's a big part of why, in my eyes, Everton still have a great chance of staying up; him and his partnership with [James] Tarkowski.\"",
      "Even though he couldn't stop Jordan Ayew from firing Palace ahead at Goodison Park on Monday night, Branthwaite has been part of an impressive defensive unit this term, with only title-chasing Arsenal earning more clean sheets than the Toffees.",
      "Manchester United reportedly want to buy Branthwaite, especially now that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is going to be part of the club. The 71-year-old is said to want to target homegrown and Branthwaite, who is tall and good with both feet, could be just what they need. He began his career at Carlisle United before joining Everton when he was 17.",
      "Carlisle have already confirmed that they'd be due to receive a windfall should Everton sell Branthwaite, who hopes to be part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for the upcoming European Championships in Germany this summer. A first senior England call-up for the Three Lions' two friendlies against Brazil and Belgium at Wembley next month is certainly on the cards.",

      "The England international was spotted on a night out in Belfast with manager Erik ten Hag insisting it was and 'internal matter' and has been dealt with. Once the problem was dealt with, Rashford marked his return from the social media storm with a goal to put the Red Devils ahead against Wolves at Molineux.",

      "Rashford to Arsenal? I think that’d be a foolish move,\" said Yorke. \"Yes, people may think he wants to leave, but for what reason? He’s just signed a new contract and he’s easily, in my opinion, one of the best players at Man United.",

      "\"I would sign a central defender for sure but I couldn’t name one right now,\" added Yorke. \"I think we need a No9, somebody up there with a little bit more Premier League experience and a good player like Son for me would be brilliant.",
      "\"He’s not like Harry Kane but he’s still got energy and brings so many goals, so someone like him would attract me very much to go and get. These clubs are all competing and to get those kinds of players will be difficult, especially if United don’t get the Champions League next season.\"",
      "If United heed Yorke's advice and overlook Williams then Ten Hag could be missing out on somebody who has likened themself to Neymar in the past. Speaking to 3News, as quoted by Goal, the £68.3million-rated winger said: \"My brother is more physical. He has a lot of pace. I am a dribbler like Neymar, [Ousmane] Dembele, and Mbappe.",
      "\"It's so important for me to have my brother on the same team with me. He teaches me a lot of things. My brother works hard. I see that and I want to be like him.\"",

      "Ashworth was put on gardening leave by Newcastle earlier on Monday and it seems Man Utd have wasted no time in getting the ball rolling.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly responded to Dan Ashworth being put on gardening leave by making a formal approach for the Newcastle United sporting director.",
      "Newcastle placed the 52-year-old on gardening leave earlier on Monday after telling the club he wanted to exit. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made former Football Association and Brighton & Hove Albion chief Ashworth as his top target for the inaugural sporting director role at United.",
      "In fact, INEOS outlined Ashworth as their man back in December, as revealed by the Manchester Evening News. Ashworth joined Newcastle from Brighton 20 months ago and helped the club sign the likes of Sandro Tonali, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon.",
      "Talks between United and Newcastle were expected imminently and now BBC Sport says a formal approach to the Magpies has been made. Ashworth is already familiar with INEOS Sporting director Sir Dave Brailsford, who is currently conducting an extensive audit of United.",
      "The pair worked together at the FA and Ashworth invited Brailsford to speak to the Newcastle squad during the summer of 2022. INEOS has always been confident of landing Ashworth. The MEN understands that the Ineos Group are so confident of striking a deal to recruit Ashworth, they have not drawn up a list of alternative options for this post.",
      "Newcastle have asked for a £20m compensation fee but MEN Sport understands that United are unwilling to pay that much and are expected to negotiate for a lower fee. The Magpies recruited Ashworth from Brighton in 2022 for £5m, so would be in line for a healthy profit, even if lower terms are agreed.",
      "Newcastle are thought to be unhappy at Ashworth’s exit less than two years into his role. The club have publicly thanked him although feelings in private may apparently be ones of annoyance.",
      "Upon announcing Ashworth’s gardening leave on Monday, Newcastle CEO Darren Eagles said in a statement: \"We are naturally disappointed that Dan has chosen to leave, however our exciting journey doesn't stop and the process to recruit a new sporting director will begin immediately.",
      "\"We thank Dan for his efforts at Newcastle United and we wish him and his family well for the future.\" Meanwhile, Eddie Howe said last week that “when you’re in that [sporting director] role I think you need longevity to actually see the fruits of your labour.\"",
      "The report says Newcastle feel as though they hold the strongest hand given his contract lasts until 2025 and cannot be terminated unless compensation is agreed. United are balancing Financial Fair Play concerns of their own having spent more than £400m over the past two summers.",
      "Erik ten Hag said last month that, as a result, there was “no space” for even loan arrivals. Compensation counts towards Financial Fair Play expenditure and so any fee paid to Newcastle for Ashworth would likely eat into Ratcliffe’s maiden summer transfer budget in a window where INEOS will want to make a statement.",

      "Manchester United's striker Rasmus Hojlund has been given a new nickname by his teammates after scoring a brace in Sunday's 2-1 win at Luton Town.",
      "Last week, the 21-year-old claimed he didn't know people were saying he looked like Australian singer Sean Millis. However, the Denmark international, who has scored in six consecutive Premier League games, is now called \"Millsy\" by his fellow players at United. They think he looks like him and defender Jonny Evans even wrote \"Millsy\" on Hojlund's Instagram post.",
      "It took Hojlund 14 games in the Premier League to score his first league goal after joining from Atalanta for £72m. But then he became the youngest player to score in six straight top league games when United won at Kenilworth Road on Sunday.",
      "When he wasn't scoring, people on social media said he looked like Millis, a famous internet personality. Millis was even asked to come watch a game at Old Trafford.",
      "After United won again and are trying to get into the Champions League by catching up to Aston Villa and Tottenham, coach Erik ten Hag said: \"He (Hojlund) has the ability and a strong character to be resilient and to be determined to score goals and that is what we saw when we scouted him.",
      "\"Of course he needed support, it was not so easy but in general he kept calm and now you see his abilities but also I want to mention that he did not have much luck. He scored some goals, but the one against Brighton in his first game and no-one still knows why.",
      "\"The player also mentioned how important it is for a striker to get goals early on, especially in a new league: Those moments are very important when you come in a new league, especially for a striker when they are not given but he is a fighter and he keeps going, has great abilities in front of the goal.\"",
      "After a match where United could have scored more, the Danish player told Sky Sports about the team's performance: \"[We had] a good beginning, two good and fast goals and then we drop off a little bit, we get unfocused and they get one back.",
      "\"We know with this crowd and this pitch and this atmosphere, 2-1 is always a dangerous result and then we go to the break. I think we created a lot of chances in the second half, we just need to score. I have one as well and yeah, a little bit annoyed by that.\"",

      "All the moments you might have missed from Manchester United's 2-1 win over Luton Town in the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United moved closer to the top four with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road on Sunday.",
      "United made the perfect start to the contest, getting their noses in front inside the first minute through Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane then added a second just six minutes later, turning home Alejandro Garnacho's effort with a clever deflection to put United in a commanding position before the clock had reached double figures.",
      "Despite that flying start, United allowed Luton back into the contest with less than a quarter of an hour played, with Carlton Morris halving the deficit. The Hatters grew in confidence from that juncture and pushed Erik ten Hag's side right up until the final whistle blew.",
      "Nevertheless, United, just as they did at Molineux and at Villa Park earlier this month, got the job done. They have displayed excellent character in recent weeks and that shone through at Kenilworth Road, especially in the latter stages.",
      "Below, MEN Sport has picked out four moments that you may not have spotted from United's three-point haul.",
      "Ahead of kick-off, the Sky Sports cameras honed in on the Kenilworth Road posh seats and spotted former One Direction star Harry Styles taking up his seat next to Luton legend Mick Harford, who scored for the Hatters when United had last visited Kenilworth Road for a league fixture back in 1992. Styles, a big United fan, had earlier met the likes of Gary Neville and Jamie Redknapp in the Sky Sports studio.",
      "As the cameras kept a watchful eye on the directors' box, Harford whipped a packet of Trebor mints out of his pocket, took one for himself and kindly offered one to Styles, who accepted his offer. The former may not have offered him another after Hojlund put United in front just a few minutes later.",
      "It was perhaps a little too early in the contest to be telling the home fans to 'shush', just as he did after Scott McTominay's winner at Villa Park seven days earlier, but Hojlund made sure the Luton faithful took note of his presence. After rounding Hatters goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski before putting United ahead inside 40 seconds, Hojlund wheeled away to celebrate.",
      "After facing the Luton supporters with a pose that could have been interpreted as him saying 'me again', holding his hands out, he turned around, pinched the corners of his shirt and ensured everyone behind the goal took note of his name. It prompted a cluster of unsavoury responses, both via hand gestures and some colourful language.",
      "Hojlund, of course, was celebrating his and United's second just a few minutes later, this time celebrating in front of the other end of the Kenilworth Road Stand.",
      "After soaking up their fair share of Luton pressure, United had a great chance to restore their two-goal lead on the hour mark. A blistering counter-attack saw Bruno Fernandes sent clear by Garnacho and he rounded Kaminski before preparing to take aim with the goal at his mercy.",
      "However, Luton loanee Albert Sambi Lokonga, who joined the club from Arsenal last season, produced a heroic sliding challenge to stop the Portuguese from scoring his first Premier League goal since November 4. The challenge was nothing short of outstanding, with the Belgian throwing everything at it to ensure Luton did not concede for a third time.",
      "Out of frustration, Fernandes kicked the ball with force against the advertising hoarding on the nearside, highlighting how annoyed he was that he had not turned the ball home. The strength of Lokonga's challenge had sent the ball out of play for a throw-in.",
      "As United's players made their way back to the team bus, Ineos' director of sport, Sir Dave Brailsford, was on hand to pass on his congratulations. He had been waiting outside the away team dressing room to greet players and club staff, as well as Luton midfielder Ross Barkley.",
      "Brailsford knows Barkley well from the latter's time at French side OGC Nice, who, of course, are owned by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Brailsford was clearly happy with the win and the mood in the United camp looks a lot cheerier than it did a few months ago.",

      "Manchester United have finally confirmed Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s £1.3billion minority investment has been ratified by the Football Association, a week after the Premier League gave its own green light.",
      "He initially takes 25 per cent ownership of the club with this rising to 28.9 per cent by the end of the calendar year. It officially concludes United’s takeover process, which first began in November 2022.",
      "Ratcliffe has already been getting to work ahead of time, appointing the incoming Omar Berrada as CEO and reportedly making a formal approach for Newcastle chief Dan Ashworth, who has been placed on gardening leave by his club.",
      "His first job is to ensure the boardroom structure is in place ahead of an important summer. However, his debut transfer window in Manchester may not be straightforward.",
      "Ratcliffe will wish to enjoy a statement summer, but the club’s previous spending will impact how much can be dished out this year. United have splashed around £555m over the past three summers and were consequently unable to bring anyone in during January because of Premier League finance rules constraints.",
      "This squeeze is set to impact the upcoming transfer window too and the absence of Champions League football could slash the budget by as much as £40m. One source close to Ratcliffe told The Telegraph that while off-field changes are rapidly being made, on-field transformations may take longer.",
      "They said: “You can’t do it overnight because of FFP and the fact the club has put themselves in a very tough financial position. You can’t buy your way out of it. You can’t do a City because there’s no headroom.",
      "“You can dress things up, invest in infrastructure – you spend as much as you want on the stadium. But when it comes to the squad that’s going to take time and funding. Clearly restructuring the squad has to be a key part of your agenda but you’re tied down by FFP so it’s a steady process.”",
      "Meanwhile, any compensation paid to Newcastle for Ashworth counts towards Financial Fair Play spending, which could further impact the transfer budget. MEN Sport understands that the club are unwilling to meet the £20m asking price Newcastle are demanding.",
      "As things stand, should both OGC Nice - also owned by Ratcliffe - and United qualify for the Champions League then only the highest-placed club would be permitted to feature in the competition due to UEFA multi-club ownership rules.",
      "There are murmurings that these regulations could be relaxed by UEFA chief Aleksander Cerefin in the future, but the current rule prevents clubs with the same owner from competing in the same competition.",
      "That said, there have been cases where teams under the same entity have met in Europe, such as RB Leipzig and RB Salzburg in the 2018/19 Europa League. Both clubs had to show that staff involved with day-to-day operations had no connection or shared interests, and that they were essentially run by two different regimes.",
      "Ratcliffe could do the same with OGC Nice and The Daily Mail suggests the 71-year-old may consider handing over the running of the French club while retaining his majority stake, with his main focus on United. It adds that clarification and a resolution is set to be sought with UEFA by the end of the season.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Bologna star Joshua Zirkzee has sent a Manchester United transfer hint to Erik ten Hag following the 2-1 win against Luton Town.",
      "The 22-year-old has made an impressive start to 2023/24 season after significantly struggling for form in the previous campaign following his permanent exit from Bayern Munich. From 27 appearances this season, the Netherlands international has scored ten goals and picked up five assists.",
      "Under Thiago Motta, Bologna have been flying with Zirkzee scoring the winner against Lazio this past weekend to make it four consecutive Serie A victories. Following that triumph, Bologna sit fifth in the table, level on points with Atalanta in the final Champions League qualifying place, although their current position could still be enough to earn a spot in next season's competition.",
      "Given his impressive form, a number of Premier League clubs are interested in signing Zirkzee with Man United and Arsenal among those linked. Bologna are said to want a fee in the region of £50million but it has now been revealed that Zirkzee has a release clause included in his current contract.",
      "However, the Italian club's sporting director Marco Di Vaio confirmed that the clause is only valid for Bayern Munich, who signed the striker from Feyenoord when he was a teenager. Last summer, United signed Rasmus Hojlund from Serie A outfit Atalanta for £72million with his first few months at Old Trafford challenging as he went 14 Premier League games without a goal.",
      "The Denmark international had shown a prolific edge in Champions League action and that was soon reflected domestically with Hojlund scoring seven goals in six consecutive appearances over the two months. However, United could still look to sign Zirkzee with it seeming as though he watched the recent 2-1 win against Luton.",
      "On Instagram, Zirkzee replied to the post by former United star Tahith Chong, who now plays for Luton with three flame emojis. The 24-year-old played 68 minutes against his old club but was unable to make a significant impact with Teden Mengi, also formerly of United, playing for Luton.",

      "Huddlestone put United ahead 2-0 early in the second half after Ethan Wheatley's opener. Stephen Mfuni scored for City in the 60th minute, but they couldn't equalise with 10 men after Sam Mather was sent off in the 79th minute.",
      "Since replacing former defender Paul McShane in 2022, Huddlestone has been a player-coach for the United Under-21s, making over a dozen appearances for the team and playing the entire 90 minutes in their last four games. But the reason for his inclusion is clear.",
      "According to the Premier League rulebook, \"each team can field a goalkeeper over the age limit\" and up to five \"over-age\" outfield players in Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy matches. Following the win, United sit 10th in the Premier League 2 standings, while City are at the bottom of the 26-team division with only one win in 14 games.",

      "The Premier League has an unknown broadcasting rule in place and it's time to change it for the sake of fans.",
      "The mini Manchester derby took place on Monday night but the game was not broadcast anywhere.",
      "Many fans questioned why they couldn't watch Manchester United Under-21s' clash against Manchester City and speculated it must have been a decision taken by MUTV. However, the reason the game wasn't broadcast live is because Premier League rules prohibit clubs from showing PL2 games while a top-flight game is being shown.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. The Premier League don't allow supporters to watch their club's Under-21 games when any other top-flight side is playing a fixture. And so because Everton played Crystal Palace on Monday, the U21 Manchester derby was not permitted to be shown live because that top flight game was broadcast on Sky Sports.",
      "The rule is bizarre, absurd and ridiculous. Premier League games are not going to lose notable viewership because an Under-21 game in another part of the country is broadcast. There were United and City fans who wanted to watch the U21 derby at Leigh Sports Village from the comfort of their homes and couldn't because Everton were playing Palace.",
      "A large section of Manchester-based fans did not care about that fixture at Goodison Park and would have probably rather played a game of tiddlywinks than watch it. The Manchester Evening News provide the most extensive coverage of United's academy and supporters who wanted regular updates could only follow the live match blog.",
      "A match report was published on the final whistle, which gave colour to readers, but the game should be shown live and the Premier League's ruling is completely non-sensical. The broadcasting rule is not widely known and deserves to be highlighted. Although following academy football is not everybody's cup of tea, the stars of the future are discovered in such matches and there is always huge interest in United's academy system.",
      "The likes of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo have all graduated to the first-team after being regulars at Leigh Sports Village, where tickets are free for supporters. Mainoo's progress has been particularly rewarding to follow. The Stockport-born lad joined the academy aged nine and he often made the cold, winter nights at Leigh worthwhile when progressing to feature for the U21s because it was obvious he had something special.",
      "The Premier League must appreciate the PL2, which is their division for U21 players, is not significant competition to their main product, which is shown on Sky Sports, TNT and Amazon. Sources have indicated the broadcast rule is considered a 'pain' to MUTV and while it's understood there were talks about removing it last year, they came to nothing. There should be a compromise agreed upon for the sake of fans.",
      "Finally, the MEN understands that as a workaround, clubs can move their kick-offs, which must be done in agreement with the opposition and approval by the league in advance.",
      "It's also been suggested by Premier League sources that changes will be likely from the start of the 2025/26 season.",

      "The future of former Real Madrid star Varane at Old Trafford is a hot topic. After sitting out some matches this season, teams from Saudi Arabia were interested in him and might want him again when summer comes. If he leaves, it looks like United now have someone who can fill the void with Kambwala.",

      "Manchester United were beaten 3-1 by Arsenal in the Women's Super League at a sold-old Emirates Stadium in what could prove to be a huge blow to the Reds' Champions League hopes",
      "If last season's triumph at the Emirates was evidence of Manchester United's burgeoning Women's Super League (WSL) pedigree, then it was on the same stage that all of the Reds' deficiencies this term were brought into sharp focus.",
      "It was back in November 2022 that Alessia Russo's late strike helped Marc Skinner's side come from behind to claim all three points against the Gunners. But, on Saturday afternoon, the England forward was a second-half substitute for the hosts as they romped to a 3-1 victory in North London, putting United's hopes of European qualification this season of life support.",
      "In truth, the damage was done long before Russo entered the pitch, as a Geyse own goal and efforts from Cloe Lacasse and Kim Little had Arsenal in firm control of the contest before the break. \"We have to be the one to get under the skin and we have to be the team that doesn’t just try and win one way,\" Skinner asserted pre-match.",
      "But from the moment the Gunners got their noses in front at a sold-out Emirates, it was United who looked unnerved by their opponents' intensity. The Reds had started well enough, with Nikita Parris seizing upon a fumbled clearance from Sabrina D'Angelo and flashing an effort just wide of the post.",
      "READ MORE:I wanted to buy United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Ratcliffe",
      "But Skinner's side were made to pay for the spurned opportunity when Katie McCabe's low corner deflected off their no.23 and into the back of the net to give Arsenal the lead inside 10 minutes. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage when Beth Mead's curling shot deflected narrowly wide of Mary Earps' far post, and again when Stina Blackstenius was played through on goal by Cloe Lacasse but, on both occasions, the interventions of Millie Turner proved decisive.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United came close to restoring parity when Ella Toone's strike ricocheted off the leg of Laia Codina and bobbled just off target. But it wasn't long before the Gunners were back on the front foot; Lacasse nodding home after Katie Zelem's miscued clearance arced straight into her path.",
      "The hosts' grip on the contest was further strengthened on the stroke of half-time, when captain Kim Little coolly dispatched the penalty after Beth Mead was upended by Gemma Evans inside the area. With Eidevall's side threatening to run away with it, Skinner unsurprisingly made an attacking change at the break, as Leah Galton was brought on in place of Gemma Evans.",
      "But it was Arsenal who looked the likeliest to find the back of the net; Blackstenius drawing a smart stop from Earps before Mead's strike cannoned off the post. The look of despondency on the face of Parris after she was, for what must have felt like the hundredth time on Saturday afternoon, called offside, spoke volumes about the meekness of United's showing in the capital.",
      "Lucia Garcia's instinctive finish in the final minute of stoppage time proved to be nothing more than a scant consolation prize for the visitors, who will know that only a flawless end to the season will be enough to keep their hopes of winning a Champions League spot alive.",
      "\"I don't think the word 'damaging' is the conversation,\" Skinner reflected post-match when queried on the potential repercussions of the result. \"We're still chasing. We're seven points behind Arsenal. We have to chase and that's what our team are resilient enough to do.\"",
      "On the criticism coming from some quarters of the United fanbase, Skinner added: \"It's part and parcel of the job. Some people love what you do, some people hate what you do. But we would never stop people from having an opinion. That's not what I'm here for.\"",
      "Though Skinner was keen to stress otherwise, Saturday's defeat is hugely detrimental to United's European ambitions. Of course, it is not just the manager who should be held accountable for the result: the Reds failed to perform to their full capacity and the players will know much more is required if they are to prevent this season from going out with a whimper.",
      "For the United boss, though, it is a defeat that raises further question marks around his own future ahead of the expiration of his contract this summer. Certainly, the voices crying for Skinner's removal will continue to grow louder in the days ahead and, at a time where the club as a whole is at the start of a brand new era, it feels like a period of change for the women's team, too, is inevitable.",

      "Manchester United Women currently play at Leigh Sports Village but the current discourse over Old Trafford raises questions about their long-term future",
      "Every other Sunday, the Whistling Wren pub in Leigh transforms into a riot of red, white and black as hordes of Manchester United fans converge for a pre-match tipple.",
      "The venue is a stone's throw away from Leigh Sports Village; the home of United's Under-21s since 2014 and its Women's team since 2018. For supporters of the latter, the place very much feels like home. After all, the 12,000 capacity stadium has played host to some of the biggest games in the club's history.",
      "It was there in April 2019 that the Reds' secured promotion to the Women's Super League (WSL) with a 5-0 dispatch of Aston Villa, while United's maiden outing in the UEFA Women's Champions League also arrived in that particular pocket of Greater Manchester. But while the stadium has quickly established itself as the spiritual home of United Women, the current discourse around the future of Old Trafford perhaps provides an opportunity to consider where exactly the long-term future of Marc Skinner's side should lie.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Ashworth wants to join United",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS’ purchase of a minority stake in the club having this week received approval from both the Premier League and the Football Association (FA), the dawn of a bright new era for Manchester United now seems, at long last, a distinct possibility. Chief among Ratcliffe's priorities is ensuring Erik ten Hag's side have a world-class stadium to rival any of their European counterparts, with the debate over whether to renovate Old Trafford or build a brand new venue having divided opinion in some quarters of the club's fanbase.",
      "The Manchester Evening News reported last week that United have been advised a new build is the best option, with any potential renovation of club's existing 114-year-old home likely to be complicated due to the railway lines and Old Trafford's existing structures. Although a new stadium would come at a higher capital cost, it is understood it would provide a better return on the club's investment, with any renovations still demanding a considerable financial outlay.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Ratcliffe wants United to create the 'Wembley of the North'; a spectacular venue that is on par with London's 90,000 capacity Wembley Stadium. The 71-year-old's ambitions for Old Trafford could reportedly see a whopping £2 billion pumped into a new stadium, with the club potentially seeking to lobby the Government for funds amid Westminster’s “levelling up” pledges.",
      "Building a new home on the vast swathes of land United own behind the Stretford End is one option that would ensure club ‘stays’ in its spiritual home whilst also moving into a new, state-of-the-art facility, similar to Spurs' move from White Hart Lane to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019. But, whatever Ratcliffe and co. opt to do, the need to factor in some thought for the women's team remains paramount.",
      "It is worth remembering it was less than two decades ago that United Women were disbanded shortly after Malcolm Glazer's completed takeover. At the time, the new regime deemed the women's team to not be part of the club's \"core business\", stressing a desire to focus on the club's women's academy instead of its senior set-up. That all changed in 2018, when United were accepted into the newly-formed FA Women's Championship. The Reds were promoted at the first time of asking and have slowly started to close the gap on the WSL's Big Three of Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "But, with the profile of the women's game only continuing on its upward trajectory, making provisions for a world-class new home for Skinner's side should surely be high on Ratcliffe's agenda. Leigh Sports Village, also home to rugby league team Leigh Leopards, boasts a greater capacity than City's Joie Stadium, Chelsea's Kingsmeadow and Arsenal's Meadow Park.",
      "However, the stadium's location is perhaps not entirely conducive to optimising the club's marketability. When it comes to the distance between WSL venues and their corresponding Premier League stadiums, only Brighton & Hove Albion's is greater than United's.",
      "Add to that the fact the nearest train station is 4.2 miles away and it's easy to spot a link between accessibility and the club's inability to ensure every game is a sell-out. That more than 43,000 fans visited Old Trafford for November's Women's Manchester derby suggests fan appetite is there, while Arsenal's ability to consistently attract record crowds at the Emirates - with this weekend's clash with United already having sold out - shows what can be done if there is a concerted effort to foster a genuine 'one club' mentality.",
      "Indeed, there would be nothing more evocative of that sentiment than making provisions for United Women to be a regular fixture at any potential new stadium, or perhaps modernising the existing Old Trafford with a reduced capacity for both the women's and academy teams.",
      "\"As somebody that admires high performance, Sir Jim (Ratcliffe) coming in is going to be a welcome investment in the whole club,\" manager Skinner said this week following news of Ineos' Premier League approval. \"It’s an exciting time. You can clearly see that we're pushing towards developing the idea of how we want us to look. Everyone at the club, you can feel feel the energy, feel the movement and I think it's really important. It's an exciting time.”",
      "Certainly, it is heartening to see that excitement extend to all facets of the club, including Skinner's side. Of course, change does not happen overnight and there is still work to be done on and off the pitch to ensure the Reds possess the same allure as the rest of the WSL's elite. But, while the Glazer takeover in 2005 stunted the growth of the women's team, there is hope Ratcliffe's arrival could be exactly what United Women need to reach to reach their next level.",

      "Manchester United will not progress to the last eight of the Continental League Cup as a result of the FA punishing Aston Villa Women, but not expelling them from the competition altogether",
      "Manchester United say they are \"very disappointed\" and are 'considering their options' following an FA ruling which has seen them dumped out of the Continental League Cup as a result of Aston Villa's administrative error.",
      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",
      "Maritz, who moved to Bescot Stadium from Women's Super League (WSL) rivals Arsenal earlier this month, was introduced in the second half against Sunderland, despite already being cup-tied. She had featured three times for the Gunners in the competition earlier in the season, starring against Bristol City, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "READ | Major Morgan Rogers to Aston Villa transfer update as third bid tabled",
      "READ |  Tielemans starts, Bailey returns - Aston Villa starting XI vs Newcastle picked",
      "As a result, her introduction against Sunderland was in breach of Conti Cup rule 8.14 - which deals with the fielding of an ineligible player - and the points for the contest have instead been awarded to the Black Cats. An FA statement released on Monday said: \"An independent tribunal have deducted three points from Aston Villa for fielding an ineligible player during their FA Women’s Continental Tyres League Cup group stage fixture against Sunderland on Wednesday 24 January 2024.",
      "\"The FA alleged that the player was ineligible for this game, as she had previously featured in the competition for her former club, which constitutes a breach of Cup Rule 8.19. Aston Villa admitted this charge and acknowledged the breach had occurred. The independent tribunal ordered that the points deducted from Aston Villa be awarded to their opponents Sunderland, while the 7-0 scoreline is to be expunged from the record.",
      "\"As a result, Sunderland will finish as Group A winners, with Aston Villa progressing to the quarter-finals as one of the two best-placed runners-up alongside Tottenham Hotspur.\"",
      "Responding to the news, a Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We are very disappointed with this outcome and do not understand its rationale. We feel that it undermines the integrity of the competition and of the women's game. We are considering our options in response.\"",
      "United have won three of their four games in the Conti Cup this term, beating Everton 7-0, Liverpool 1-0 and Leicester City 3-1.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "\"That's football isn't it? It has its ups and its downs. I remember pre-Ferguson it wasn't great for quite some time - for a more extended period of time actually, for about 25 years.\"",
      "\"Eleven years is a long period of time, isn't it?",
      "\"Fundamentally you want to see your club being where it should be.",
      "\"It's one of the biggest clubs in the world. It should be playing the best football in the world, it hasn't been doing that for 10 or 11 years. So it's certainly related to the decision [to invest].\"",
      "Rivalling local 'enemies'",
      "\"They are one of the best teams on the planet,\" Ratcliffe said of Man City, champions of England for three years running.",
      "\"We have a lot to learn from the noisy neighbour, and our other neighbour [Liverpool]. They are the enemy at the end of the day and there's nothing I would like better than to knock both of them or one of them off their perch.",
      "\"But equally, we are the three great northern clubs and we're all quite close to each other,\" he added.",
      "\"They've been in a good place for a little while. Both of them. There are things to be learned from both of those clubs.",
      "\"They've got sensible organisations, great people in the organisations and a driven elite sort of environment that they work in. And as a consequence, the results have dropped out of the bottom. So I'm very respectful of them, but they're still the enemy.\"",
      "Returning to glory",
      "\"It's not a light switch. It's not one of these things that changes overnight.",
      "\"We have to be careful we don't rush at it in a way, you don't want to run to the wrong solution rather than walk to the correct solution.",
      "\"We have two issues - one is the longer term, getting Manchester United to where, where we would like to get it but there's also the shorter term of getting the most out of the club as it stands today because we would like to see the Champions League for next season if we can.",
      "\"The key challenge here is that longer term. We need to do things well and properly, and thoroughly, and not rush at it, so it's not an overnight change, it's going to take two or three seasons. You have to ask the fans for some patience.",
      "\"I know the world these days likes instant gratification but that's not the case with football really.",
      "\"Look at Pep Guardiola at Man City, it didn't happen overnight, it takes time to build a squad...\"",
      "Assessment of Ten Hag",
      "\"I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"But if you look at the 11 years that have gone since David Gill and Sir Alex have stepped down, there have been a whole series of coaches, some of which were very good. And none of them were successful, or survived for very long. And you can't blame all the coaches.",
      "\"The only conclusion you can draw is that the environment in which they were working, didn't work. And Erik's been in that environment. I'm talking about the organisation, the people in the structure, and the atmosphere in the club.",
      "\"We have to do that bit. So I'm not really focused on the coach. I'm focused on getting that bit right. And it's not for me to judge that anyway. I'm not a football professional.\"",
      "Signings 'top of the list'",
      "Ratcliffe said: \"I think recruitment in the modern game is critical. Manchester United have clearly spent a lot of money but they haven't done as well as some other clubs.",
      "\"So when I was talking about being best in class in all aspects of football, recruitment is clearly top of the list. I'm more thinking about getting recruitment in a good place in the future.",
      "\"There's not much I can do about what's happened in the past, so there's no point they never want me going there really.",
      "\"So our thinking is all about how we become first in class in recruitment going forward. Which means you need the right people.\"",
      "Ashworth pursuit and Newcastle's asking price",
      "\"Dan Ashworth is clearly one of top sporting directors in the world. I have no doubt he is a very capable person. He is interested in Manchester United because it's the biggest challenge at the biggest club in the world.",
      "\"I understand why Newcastle would be disappointed but then you can't criticise Dan because it's a transient industry. You can understand why Dan would be interested because it's the ultimate challenge. We'll have to see how it unfolds.\"",
      "\"A bit silly, personally,\" he said on reports of Newcastle wanting £20m from United to take Ashworth straight away.",
      "\"I won;t get dragged into that. What I do think is completely absurd is suggesting a man who is really good at his job sits in his garden for one and a half years.",
      "\"We had a very grown-up conversation with City about Omar Berrada. When things got done we sorted it out very amicably. They could see why he wanted to take that challenge.",
      "\"You look at Pep Guardiola and when he's done with one of his footballers he doesn't want them to sit in the garden for one and a half years. He doesn't do that. That's not the way the UK works or the law works.\"",
      "Mason Greenwood's future",
      "\"We will make a decision,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"All I can do is talk about the principle of how we will approach decisions like that. Is he the right type of footballer? Is he a good person or not?",
      "\"It's quite clear we have to make a decision,\" he added. \"There is no decision that's been made. He's on loan, obviously, but he's not the only one.",
      "\"We've got one or two footballers that we have to deal with and we have to make a decision on, so we will do that.",
      "\"The process will be: understand the facts, not the hype, and then try and come to a fair decision on the basis of values - which is basically is he a good guy or not.",
      "\"Could he play sincerely for Manchester United well, and would we be comfortable with it and the fans comfortable with it?\"",
      "Redeveloping Old Trafford",
      "\"What our plan is, is that we are going to work on the refurb, which is the obvious one and the one we know that we can afford,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"But we'll put together a small task force which probably we can talk about next week, at arm's length of people who have useful opinions and explore whether a bigger project makes sense.\"",
      "Sir Jim added: \"What we've seen of the stadium so far, there is a really good case to refurbish Old Trafford, probably about £1bn in cost, or something like that.",
      "\"You finish up with a great stadium, it's probably an 80 or 90,000-seater. But it's not perfect because you're modifying a stadium that is slap bang up against a railway line and all that type of stuff, so it's not an ideal world.",
      "\"But you finish up with a very good answer. Manchester United needs a stadium befitting one of the biggest clubs in the world and at the moment, it's not there.",
      "Relationship with the Glazers",
      "Ratcliffe added: \"We have a really good relationship with Joel and Avram, who are the only two of the siblings that we've got to know and have met, actually.",
      "\"And there's a fair amount of trust, I think, between those two parties. And they obviously are very comfortable with us running the sports side of the club.",
      "\"This is going to be a very sports-led club, it's all going to be about performance on the pitch.",
      "\"I'm still a significant shareholder, even in respect of all the other things in the club. We're obviously going to be on the ground, whereas the Glazer family are a fair way away.",
      "\"So I don't see an issue in us being able to influence the club in all the right ways going forward, to be honest.\"",
      "He continued: \"I don't think we're going to be taking the legal agreements out of the bottom drawer.",
      "\"I just hope they gather dust and we never see them. Which it should be. It should be on the basis of a relationship.",
      "\"As long as we're doing the right things, then I'm certain that relationship is going to go very well.\"",
      "'False dawns' and the sale process",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I remember at the Monaco Grand Prix, which was in May, we opened a bottle of very expensive champagne and all celebrated.",
      "\"That was in May… but that was a false dawn and we went through several more false dawns after that.",
      "\"We had a few surprises on the way. Not at the Glazers' making. We just kept bumping into problems, particularly with the non-executives on the board.\"",
      "An 'enormous' challenge",
      "\"[It's] certainly the biggest challenge in sport that we've undertaken. It's enormous - and the club is enormous.",
      "\"The tentacles reach around the world, don't they? Everywhere I go in the world it's Manchester United. It affects an awful lot of people on the planet and getting it right is not easy.",
      "\"We've got to get so many aspects of that club right. And the right people doing the right thing at the right time and doing it well.",
      "\"It's a very complex problem, really, football. That's surprising considering it's just putting 11 players on a football field, and they run around. But it's very complex getting there.",
      "Money not a motivation",
      "Ratcliffe said: \"To be honest, I don't think I'll ever lose money.",
      "\"For me, it's not about a financial investment. The objective was to get involved and being influential in the future of Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"I don't believe I'll ever lose money in it and I'm not interested. I've just put that aside. It'll sit there forever but I don't see that the value is going to devalue. I don't believe that.",
      "\"In that sense, I don't think I've been financially stupid, but it's not my motivation in life at all.\"",
      "Growing the club's revenue",
      "\"We're really, really clear about that - It's football-led. So if we're successful on the pitch, then everything else will follow,\" said Ratcliffe.",
      "\"In monitoring clubs, Manchester United a bit, I think, in the last 10 years or so, that if you're really good in commercial and you make lots of money, then you'll be successful in football because you've got lots of money to spend.",
      "\"But I think, that's flawed because it only starts for a certain while and you start to degrade the brand if you're not careful.",
      "\"But we're really clear that football will drive the club. If we're really successful at football, then commercial will follow. And we'll make more money.\"",
      "Challenging clubs with nation-state funding",
      "\"The nation state bit helps to a degree, but FFP (Financial Fair Play rules) limits the degree by a considerable margin, doesn't it?",
      "\"So ultimately, it becomes about how successful the club is because that dictates your FFP.",
      "\"With FPP you have to operate the club within its own means. So clearly that means that if you've got a bigger club it ought to be more successful than a smaller club, sort of, by definition, because you've got more means they can spend more money and recruitment.",
      "\"FFP has become a new aspect of running the football club, and it's clearly a really critical part of running a football club.",
      "\"And you have to think about how you can manage FFP to the benefit of the club.",
      "\"There are different ways in which you can do that. But ultimately FFP says you have to operate the club within its own means. And, effectively, it takes into account your prior expenditure, and the club's spent quite heavily in the last couple of seasons.",
      "\"So that does impact FFP going forward, because they've used quite a large part of their allowance if you like. So we need to be quite clear in the summer as to what the extent of… I don't know the full answer to that question at the moment.",
      "\"It's obviously related to sales as well as purchases, and so we need to get our heads around that well before the summer window, so we understand the number but there's no question that history will impact this summer window.\"",

      "Ratcliffe has agreed to pay £26 ($33) per share for a quarter of the Class A shares, as well as paying that price for 25 per cent of the Class B shares held by the Glazer family. Each Class B shares confers 10 times as many votes as a Class A share.",
      "Further shares have been issued in return for the initial £158.5m ($200m) capital investment made by Ratcliffe upon completion of the deal. Ratcliffe will invest a further £79.2m ($100m) by December 31 and his ownership will then increase to 28.9 per cent.",
      "United co-chairman Joel Glazer said: \"I would like to welcome Sir Jim as co-owner and look forward to working closely with him and Ineos Sport to deliver a bright future for Manchester United.\"",

This was Ratcliffe's opportunity.",
      "In October 2022, Ratcliffe revealed he had met the Glazers and was told they were not interested in selling. \"They are the nicest people,\" he said of the family. Perhaps this was a telling sign of what would unfold a year later.",

In February 2023, the same month United's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney risked the wrath of fans by claiming the Glazers have done a \"fantastic job\" at the club, several offers were made but it soon became clear the two frontrunners for a complete takeover were Ratcliffe and somewhat of an unfamiliar figure - Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani.",
      "Apart from being the son of the former Qatar prime minister, so little was known publicly about Sheikh Jassim that newsrooms were frantically scrambling around for information, while even basic tasks such as finding authentic photos proved difficult. Almost overnight, he'd become the talk of United's worldwide fanbase and the focus of the media, with everyone equally intrigued about what his vision for the club entailed.",
      "When it emerged Sheikh Jassim wanted to own 100 per cent of United, was willing to clear the club's existing debt, and spend £1.4bn on infrastructure and transfers, the possibilities under a Qatari regime seemed limitless.",
      "There were of course important ethical and moral issues to address, but from a pure footballing perspective, United fans only needed to look four miles across town at the Etihad to see how quickly a transformation can take place under similar circumstances. This offered genuine hope and was a chance for a fresh start, but it almost seemed too good to be true. And so it proved.",

Representatives from both parties visited Old Trafford and Carrington in March to meet United officials and discuss their proposals in detail. While Ratcliffe showed up in person, Sheikh Jassim stayed away.",
      "\"Paying a personal visit was not relevant as far as Sheikh Jassim was concerned. He didn't want the publicity,\" says Solhekol. \"Ratcliffe's attitude has been much more flexible.\"",
      "Having previously made a world-record bid, Sheikh Jassim made a final take-it-or-leave-it offer in June, widely suggested to be more than £5bn but still below the Glazers' asking price. At this point, Ratcliffe's proposal valued United at a higher price but was not for the whole club and would give the Americans the chance to stay. Everything was beginning to point towards one outcome.",
      "After more fan protests outside - and inside - Old Trafford at the start of the 2023/24 season, the thick skins of the Glazers came to the fore once more when reports emerged in September that they were considering taking United off the market - almost 10 months after the announcement of a potential sale. All that fuss, seemingly for nothing.",
      "As a result of those reports, United's share price dropped by 18 per cent in one day and reduced the club's value by more than £600m. It was the biggest drop since the club was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012.",
      "As the weeks continued to pass with no finish line in sight, Sheikh Jassim - like most of the football world - had grown tired of the saga. On October 14, he withdrew from the process because, according to some sources, he \"wasn't willing to dance to the Glazers' tune\". That could well be the case, but perhaps his bid was always destined to fail.",
      "\"Sheikh Jassim and the Qataris never really engaged with the Glazers,\" Solhekol says. \"Ratcliffe has tried to have a relationship with them. He's described them as nice people and been clever with the personal touch. That's been the difference.\"",
      "Sheikh Jassim's withdrawal paved the way for Ratcliffe to pay more than £1.25bn for a 27.7 per cent minority stake in United and take control of football operations, the first step in what many hope will be a full takeover.",
      "Ratcliffe's tenure has started positively and INEOS' encouraging plans have shifted the spotlight away from the Glazers in recent times. However, as long as the Americans remain as majority owners, there will always be pessimism about what the future holds. Whether they decide to relinquish full control one day is still anyone's guess.",

      "Sky in Germany: Xabi Alonso and Zinedine Zidane targets if Bayern Munich decide to part ways with Thomas Tuchel this summer; ex-Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a shock potential interim solution should the German side be forced to make a change mid-season",
      "Tuesday 20 February 2024 16:32, UK",
      "Liverpool target Xabi Alonso is the preferred candidate to succeed Thomas Tuchel if Bayern Munich decide to part ways with the manager this summer – while they are also looking at Zinedine Zidane and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "The pressure has increased on Tuchel following Bayern's 3-2 loss at Bochum on Sunday which leaves the German team eight points behind Alonso's Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "It was also a third straight defeat after they were beaten 1-0 at Lazio in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie last week.",
      "Facing a first trophyless season in 12 years, Bayern's primary plan remains to reach the end of the campaign with Tuchel and honestly assess the situation.",
      "Bayern's hierarchy immediately decided to stick with Tuchel after the embarrassing defeat at Bochum with the former Chelsea and PSG boss not considering his resignation.",
      "Sky Germany's Felix Fischer said: \"It's a lot of pressure. The bosses are looking at game-to-game and watching really closely, as well as an eye on how Tuchel is presenting himself and how the team is playing.",
      "\"They didn't expect the defeat to Bochum at all and now they have a closer look at how the team performs against Leipzig in Munich on Saturday night.",
      "\"It could be a do-or-die game for Tuchel. The bosses want to finish the season with him as a coach, but we know they have some other coaches in the back of their mind.\"",
      "Work is going on in the background regarding his potential successor and, in the event of a summer separation from Tuchel, Alonso is considered the preferred solution internally.",
      "The former Liverpool midfielder is the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Anfield this summer after impressing at Leverkusen.",
      "Klopp has recently hailed the Spaniard as the \"standout\" manager from the new generation of bosses.",
      "Another of the most prominent candidates Bayern have been thinking about too, in the past few hours and days, is ex-Real Madrid head coach Zidane.",
      "There is nothing concrete at this stage, but what Bayern appreciate about the Frenchman is his aura and experience while he is also immediately available.",
      "The 51-year-old, who has been without a job since leaving Real in May 2021, won the Champions League three times in his managerial time at the Spanish club, while he also led them to the LaLiga title twice.",
      "Bayern have also been looking at ex-Manchester United boss Solskjaer as a potential interim solution should they be forced to make a change before the end of the campaign.",
      "Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund knows Solskjaer very well and has been following the Norwegian's path for years. However, there have not yet been any concrete discussions about that eventuality.",
      "Solskjaer has been without a job since being sacked by Man Utd in November 2021. He spent nearly three years in charge at Old Trafford as he guided United to second in the 2020/21 season and lost the 2021 Europa League final on penalties to Villarreal.",
      "The 50-year-old is currently employed as a UEFA technical observer, attending Champions League games and providing reports throughout this season.",
      "Discussing the potential candidates, Fischer added: \"It would be very difficult to get Alonso now, of course. There's no chance because he wants to win three titles with Bayer Leverkusen. It's not an option for now. But for the future, they really have Alonso on their mind as an ex-player and as a really good coach.",
      "\"Zidane is on the list, he was a big player and was really successful as a coach already for Real Madrid. But as far as we know, there hasn't been any contact yet.",
      "\"The same counts for Solskjaer. He is a true legend of Manchester United and he became a nightmare for Bayern during the Champions League final in 1999.",
      "\"But the club wants to finish the season with Tuchel and to help, they have to be successful in the next weeks. Maybe they can continue the work with him, not just this season, but maybe in the next one. That's the target but it's a difficult target right now.\"",
      "With Bayern, Liverpool and, reportedly, Real Madrid circling, is it inevitable Alonso will leave Bayer Leverkusen?",
      "Fischer added: \"It isn't. One of the bosses said that he is certain Alonso will stay at the club. Those words can change, but it's all in the hands of Alonso. He will decide which step is best for him and which he will take next.",
      "\"If he wants to stay with Leverkusen and be successful with that club, he will do that. If there is really a chance to join Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp leaves, or Real Madrid if Carlo Ancelotti leaves or at Bayern if Tuchel leaves, he will do what feels right to him.\"",
      "Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy:",
      "It is testament not only to his suitability for the role, but his status as the next top manager that Xabi Alonso is spoken about separately in the discussion for the Liverpool job to succeed Jurgen Klopp. There is Xabi, and then The Others.",
      "It is a consequence of his small yet sublime body of work so far; the construction at Real Sociedad B, leading them back to the Segunda Division for the first time since 1961-62 and then quickly transforming Bayer Leverkusen into a tactically supreme unbeaten machine.",
      "Only Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich have ever set a better pace atop the Bundesliga. Leverkusen have not been beaten in 32 matches across all competitions, are in the German Cup semi-finals, and the last 16 of the Europa League. They are on a special run and are primed to make history this season.",
      "Leverkusen play with panache and intelligence; lionising possession but also shifting to control the game without the ball as they showcased in a 3-0 masterclass against Bayern.",
      "There have been attempts to suggest Alonso's approach jars with the more direct and transitional qualities of Liverpool's squad. While Bayer do employ a more patient build-up that is comparable to Manchester City, his Real Sociedad B were much less geared to short passing. Alonso has illustrated his adaptability already between those clubs, but also against different opponents.",
      "He already feels like a Liverpool manager, and that's without factoring in his understanding of, and bond with the club developed during five seasons of setting the tempo in their midfield.",
      "Alonso fits the dynamic of an exciting, young team heaving with potential that will need some nips, tucks and to create a new story.",
      "There are complexities; he is still early into his Bayer project and ideally would have mapped a longer period of construction with them. Alonso's focus, rightly, is on crowing a fantastic season with top honours.",
      "The club don't want to lose him, but know he will have his pick of options - Real Madrid and Bayern Munich will soon be knocking too - and can decide his timing.",
      "Liverpool would not want to do anything to disrupt Alonso's current work. He is worth the patience though, and doing whatever is necessary to get.",

      "PGMOL referee chief Howard Webb goes through the latest VAR talking points from the Premier League; Newcastle's penalty was controversially given against Bournemouth despite Fabian Schar being offside; should Jack Harrison's goal for Everton vs Tottenham have stood, plus more incidents...",
      "Tuesday 20 February 2024 20:20, UK",
      "In the latest Mic'd Up, PGMOL chief Howard Webb goes through incidents in Newcastle vs Bournemouth, Everton vs Spurs, Sheff Utd vs West Ham and more...",
      "Initially, Newcastle were flagged offside as a free-kick was played. However, Fabian Schar had also gone down in the area after having his shirt pulled by Bournemouth's Adam Smith.",
      "VAR felt that although Schar was in an offside position, he had not committed an offside offence, before sending referee Michael Salisbury to the monitor to review.",
      "As a result, the referee overturned the initial decision to award Newcastle a penalty for the foul.",
      "Howard Webb: \"It's an unusual situation and somewhat complex... the law specifically allocates some wording around this type of situation.",
      "\"For an offside offence to be committed, the player in an offside position has to challenge for the ball or play the ball - just being in an offside position itself is not necessarily an offence.",
      "\"So the law stipulates that a player who is in an offside position who is moving towards the ball with the intention of playing the ball at some point is then fouled by an opponent - prior to attempting to play the ball - it's the foul that gets penalised because that occurred before the action by the attacker that would commit the offside offence.",
      "\"And that is the exact situation we saw here. When the free-kick is taken, Schar is in an offside position, there's no doubt about that. He then starts moving towards goal and we see Adam Smith pull his shirt. It's a sustained holding offence that starts outside and continues inside.",
      "\"In normal circumstances, we wouldn't flag as soon as the free-kick comes in. The assistant referee waits to see where the ball goes - another Newcastle player might come in from an onside position and head the ball towards goal.",
      "\"Does Schar get involved with the play by challenging for the ball when it's in that dropping zone? He doesn't have a chance to do any of those things because he's dragged down before he gets there.",
      "\"That action by Smith deprives Schar of being involved with a second phase, for example.",
      "\"Imagine if we had flagged immediately as the free-kick is taken. People would say 'what are you doing, you don't know where the ball is going. It might go to Botman, who is onside, and he might score. So why are you stopping this play in this moment?'",
      "\"We see that happen all the time in the Premier League where officials wait to see what happens. Schar might just stand and not continue moving forward, he might not get on the end of the ball. He's not challenging for the ball in that moment so he's not actually committing an offside offence, he's just in an offside position.",
      "\"It happens a lot in the Premier League where goals are scored with players in an offside position.",
      "\"Of course, if the ball goes to Schar and he challenges Smith, that is an offside offence which we would penalise. That would take precedence over any holding offence.",
      "\"If the holding offence happens as he's challenging for the ball, we'd give offside because he's in the motion of challenging for the ball. But at this point, he isn't.",
      "\"So the law stipulates that this is not an offence of offside because he's just in an offside position, he hasn't done anything. And if a player moving towards the ball in an offside position is fouled in this situation, the first offence is the foul because the offside hasn't yet happened.",
      "\"He hasn't done anything in that position that we could penalise as officials.\"",
      "In the final moments of West Ham's trip to Sheffield United, the Hammers thought they should have been awarded a penalty after Jarrod Bowen was seemingly barged over by Anel Ahmedhodzic. However, it was Sheffield United who were given the free-kick with Bowen committing the foul.",
      "Howard Webb: \"A lot of people thought it was a penalty. When you watch it on the TV, it shows a replay that looks like the Sheffield United player is not looking at the ball and bowls into Bowen.",
      "\"When VAR looked at that, knowing that the on-field decision by the referee was a free-kick to Sheffield United for a foul from Bowen, he sees quite clearly that Bowen's arm is on the shoulder of Ahmedhodzic and pulls him towards Bowen and they fall over.",
      "\"The Sheffield United player is actually looking at the ball most of the time, he's trying to maintain his view of the ball. He only can't do that when he's pulled by Bowen.",
      "\"Looking at all the angles we had available, we were able to confirm the on-field decision as a foul to Sheffield United, rather than the penalty most people thought should have been given when people watched it more casually on a TV broadcast.",
      "\"Don't forget, the on-field decision is important. The independent panel - the key match incidents (KMI) panel, which has a lot of ex-players on it - that we put all incidents to were unanimous that this was a correct decision and not a penalty for the action by Bowen of pulling the defender onto him and going down.",
      "\"Ahmedhodzic is square, he's defending in the way he's meant to defend and he's looking at the ball. There's some jostling, which happens in most situations when balls are coming into the penalty area with players in close proximity, so we're not too concerned about that.",
      "\"But then we see the arm coming round, which spins the player and off-balances him and brings him down. That's what the on-field referee saw.",
      "\"From a VAR point of view, you're never going to see that as a clear and obvious error.\"",
      "Everton's Jack Harrison saw the ball divert home off of his leg after a header from Dominic Calvert-Lewin. VAR reviewed it after a tussle between Harrison and Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, but did not see a clear and obvious error in disallowing the goal. It was allowed to stand.",
      "Howard Webb: \"This one is just OK. We know that players are entitled to their space on the field.",
      "\"Harrison places his feet down, he might just place his body a little bit. He doesn't step clearly into the path of Vicario, he doesn't usher him into the back of the goal, he doesn't drag his arm, which is important for the goalkeeper of course.",
      "\"We are seeing more tactics in and around set-pieces that we need to be aware of. We have analysts as well that help us stay ahead of the game on those things.",
      "\"One of the things we're always mindful of is the importance of the goalkeeper in set-pieces. He's the only player that can use his hands so therefore he has a huge advantage. If people are trying to nullify goalkeepers, that can be really impactful.",
      "\"But this is one that's just on the right side of acceptability. Harrison is entitled to use his own space, he has a bit of strength and I don't see a clear action that takes the goalkeeper out and impedes him in a way I would want to see if this was penalised.",
      "\"But we are asking the on-field officials to deal with this first and foremost, not necessarily relying on VAR because a lot of these are subjective calls.\"",
      "Ben Osborn's goal for Sheffield United is initially ruled out for a foul on the goalkeeper, but following a VAR check, the goal is instead chalked off for offside.",
      "Howard Webb: \"You hear the on-field officials penalise Ben Osborn for what they perceive, in real time, to be a foul on the goalkeeper.",
      "\"I think it's the assistant referee on the far side who, on this set-piece, has been given the specific responsibility by the referee of focusing on the goalkeeper. He sees that coming-together, he thinks Osborn has grabbed hold of the goalkeeper's arm and they penalise him.",
      "\"Thankfully, the referee holds his whistle until the ball is in the back of the goal before penalising so the VAR can check whether or not there is a foul on the goalkeeper.",
      "\"When the VAR looks at it, he doesn't really see anything that's worthy of being penalised. He sees a bit of a coming-together, but then he sees the goalkeeper reset. He's not really impacted by that and determines that's not a foul.",
      "\"Of course, we're not only looking at that, we're looking at the rest of the phase of play that leads up to that situation, including whether or not any players are in an offside position and when he looks at that and sees Osborn in an offside position when the ball is last played by a Sheffield United player.",
      "\"Yes, it hits Buonanotte before going to Osborn, but that's only a deflection and therefore is still in an offside position, and still committing an offside offence right in front of the goalkeeper. It's rightly intervened upon by the VAR to confirm the disallowing of the goal, but for a different reason to the one that was given on the field.",
      "\"If it was a deliberate play by Buonanotte, that would negate the position of Osborn. It's not. It hits him, he has no time to control his body movement, he's not actually playing the ball.",
      "\"In this situation, we still send the referee to the screen because the on-field decision was subjective - a foul - it would have been a direct free-kick to the defence. There's no foul, but we send him to the screen to see that and then to also show them the offside and we restart with an indirect free-kick. Good process, good identification.",
      "\"If there'd been no offside, I know the VAR would've intervened to have this goal awarded because he recognised a clear and obvious error in the first decision - the foul on the goalkeeper - which he doesn't think exists.\"",
      "Bournemouth striker Dominic Solanke initially had a goal ruled out against West Ham for offside with on-field officials believing Ryan Christie had played him through. However, when VAR reviewed the incident, it showed Kalvin Phillips made the touch, playing Solanke onside. VAR then advised for a goal to be given.",
      "Howard Webb: \"A good example of why VAR is so important. At full speed, it does look like Ryan Christie plays that ball through to Solanke.",
      "\"The officials communicate to confirm that's what they've seen. You'll hear how much more the officials are communicating too.",
      "\"And when VAR check the video, they see the clear movement by Kalvin Phillips and it plays Solanke onside so a goal can be given.",
      "\"It shows the value of VAR in the Premier League.\"",

Borussia Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw with PSV in their Champions League last 16 first leg.",
      "Factoring the strength of those teams, data providers Opta predict the Premier League still has an 82 per cent chance of claiming a bonus Champions League spot for next season.",

      "Regarding the final bullet point, those two associations will earn one place for the club best ranked in the domestic league behind the UEFA Champions League positions.",
      "For example, based on the collective performance of their clubs last season, England and Italy would have both had an additional spot in the Champions League - meaning Liverpool and Atalanta - both fifth in their respective leagues - would have entered the competition.",
      "Previously in 2005, when Liverpool won the Champions League but finished outside of the top four, the Premier League was granted five potential Champions League berths with the caveat of having to go through qualifiers.",
      "During the 2015/16 season, Spain became the first association to have five teams in the Champions League group stage after Sevilla lifted the Europa League despite finishing outside the top four in LaLiga the previous campaign and Valencia came through the play-off round.",
      "The Premier League has confirmed that in five of the last six seasons and seven of the past 11, the performance of English clubs in Europe would have merited an additional spot.",
      "Remarkably, there is an extremely unlikely chance of there being as many as seven Premier League clubs in the Champions League next season based on the change in rules.",
      "That would require both the Champions League and Europa League winners to be from the Premier League and both teams finishing outside the top five.",
      "Taking the total number of teams from 32 to 36 in the Champions League, the biggest change will see a transformation from the traditional group stage to a single league phase including all participating teams.",
      "Every club will now be guaranteed a minimum of eight league stage games against eight different opponents (four home games, four away) rather than the previous six matches against three teams, played on a home-and-away basis.",
      "The top eight sides in the league will qualify automatically for the knockout stage, while the teams finishing in ninth to 24th place will compete in a two-legged play-off to secure their path to the last 16 of the competition.",
      "Given that the Champions League will almost double in size - from a total of 125 games to 225 - at least four additional matchdays will be required to fit in the extra games. This will inevitably cause issues for domestic leagues, with fewer dates to fit in all their games.",
      "At the time of the new model's announcement back in April 2021, then Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan said: \"More and more games, is no one thinking about us players? The new UCL format is just the lesser of the two evils in comparison to the Super League.\"",
      "Qualification for the two other UEFA competitions, the Europa League and Europa Conference League, will follow the same protocols as in previous years, albeit if the fifth spot qualifies for the Champions League, the Europa League spot will go to the team finishing sixth.",
      "Similar format changes will also be applied to the Europa League (eight matches in the league stage) and Europa Conference League (six matches in the league stage) and both will also include 36 teams in the league phase.",
      "Yes it does - provided the domestic cups are won by those finishing inside the top seven as seen last season with Manchester United winning the Carabao Cup and Manchester City winning the FA Cup.",
      "Based on last season, eighth-placed Tottenham would have qualified for the Europa Conference League and Aston Villa would have been promoted to the Europa League."

      "Monday 19 February 2024 08:10, UK",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's record-breaking double was enough to earn Manchester United a tense 2-1 win at Luton -  a fourth league victory in a row to take Erik ten Hag's side closer to the top four.",
      "The 21-year-old became the youngest Premier League player to score in six straight games as he put United two up inside seven minutes - clinically finishing after 36 seconds following Amari'i Bell's mistake, before instinctively chesting in Alejandro Garnacho's shot from a corner.",
      "Carlton Morris rounded off a scintillating opening 15 minutes by pulling one back and Luton should have levelled with several big chances as they put United on the ropes, with Casemiro lucky not to see red for lunging on Ross Barkley while on a booking.",
      "United were more settled after the break - with Casemiro taken off at the interval - and should have put the game to bed as Bruno Fernandes and Garnacho both failed to score despite both rounding Luton goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski.",
      "The hosts pushed for an equaliser until the last kick of the game - with Barkley hitting the bar - but Rob Edwards queried the amount of added time in the second half, saying: \"I don’t know where that one came from. Man Utd are winning 2-1 so it’s four minutes.\"",
      "But United held on to move within three points of fifth-placed Tottenham, with a top-five spot possibly being enough for a Champions League place next season.",
      "Asked about Hojlund's scintillating form in front of goal, with the striker now on eight goals in his last seven games in all competitions, Ten Hag told Sky Sports: \"We recruited him as he's a strong character. Although he's 21 he can really perform under stress. That's what you need as a Manchester United striker.",
      "\"He doesn't get nervous or lose confidence when he's not scoring. Once you are in a run, you see it, now he's scoring and he's in. That's how he is now. He has a lot of confidence and I'm sure he'll score more.\"",
      "Luton: Kaminski (7); Mengi (6), Osho (6), Bell (5); Ogbene (6), Barkley (7), Lokonga (8), Doughty (6); Morris (7), Woodrow (5), Chong (6)\n\n\nSubs used: Clark (6), Townsend (6), Berry (n/a)\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (6); Dalot (7), Varane (7), Maguire (6), Shaw (5); Mainoo (6), Casemiro (5); Garnacho (5), Fernandes (5), Rashford (6); Hojlund (9)\n\n\nSubs used: Lindelof (7), Evans (8), McTominay (6), Amrabat (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Rasmus Hojlund (Man Utd)",
      "It took just 36 seconds for Hojlund to make history. Bell's slack, square pass along the backline was picked up by the Danish forward. He had the simple task of skipping past Kaminski and slotting home.",
      "The United onslaught continued, as Luton struggled early doors. Casemiro was denied with a block from a corner, which was cleared as far as Marcus Rashford whose shot was saved by Kaminski. Garnacho also stung the Luton goalkeeper's palms in a similar fashion.",
      "But another shot from distance ended up bringing United's second. Garnacho's fierce effort was chested on by Hojlund in a wonderful improvised finish.",
      "Then came the attempted Luton fightback as former United midfielder Tahith Chong saw a shot deflected into the path of Morris, who beat Andre Onana to the ball to head home.",
      "All of a sudden, the game changed as it was Luton on the attack, with United now on the ropes. Morris and Gabriel Osho put free headers over the bar from set-pieces, before Cauley Woodrow saw a clear-cut chance in the box blocked after Harry Maguire cheaply gifted the ball to the impressive Barkley in his own half.",
      "United came under more pressure as Casemiro, already booked for a challenge on Bell, avoided a second yellow for lunging at Barkley. Luke Shaw also picked up a booking and was forced off before half-time. Meanwhile, Alfie Doughty should have brought Luton level by firing wide from the edge of the box after cutting inside.",
      "Ten Hag took Casemiro and Maguire off at half-time and United did seem more controlled after the break.",
      "Diogo Dalot was picked out by Onana in the box and Kaminski smothered the effort. The Luton goalkeeper was equal to fierce strikes from Rashford and Garnacho either side of the hour mark.",
      "United had two chances to seal it, however. The first fell to Bruno Fernandes who rounded Kaminski but was denied by a last-ditch block by the retreating Albert Sambi Lokonga. Garnacho did exactly the same on the break moments later but dallied as he cut back inside and Luton cleared with the goal gaping.",
      "Fernandes put another big chance wide of Kaminski's far post as many began to question Luton would make them pay. They nearly did in the final minute of stoppage time as Barkley headed on a corner - only for it to crash off the bar and over, with Onana scrambling.",
      "Another example of a valiant defeat for Luton.",
      "Ten Hag revealed after the game that he took Casemiro and Maguire off at half-time because he felt the sense that the referee would soon send them off for their next foul.",
      "\"I saw the reaction of the referees and I thought the next one [foul] they would go off. I didn't take the risk. We had good replacements in [Scott] McTominay and [Jonny] Evans. It was the right decision as the performance of those two was very good.\"",
      "Later in his press conference, Ten Hag claimed Casemiro is unfairly treated as officials are booking him when he does not touch opposition players. Last week, the Brazilian was bemused for being booked for a foul on Aston Villa's Matty Cash with minimal to no contact on the player. On Sunday, he was cautioned for a foul on Luton defender Bell.",
      "\"Even when he is not touching opponents, he gets booked,\" Ten Hag said. \"Often on the first moment in the game as well. It was crazy today.",
      "\"The first booking was so unfair. The second? It could have been given. That's why we took him off. But it's difficult to play when you are not even touching an opponent and get booked.",
      "\"Now he is back in the team, he gives so much to the team. So much calmness and organisation. We are very happy, because since he is back, the team has lifted its levels.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Luton manager Rob Edwards felt United \"got away with one\" regarding the Casemiro incident - but refused to blame the officials for his side's defeat.",
      "\"The fact he came off at HT probably tells you that,\" the Hatters boss said. \"They [United] are saying first [yellow card] wasn't [one], but just because the first one wasn't that doesn't mean second one isn't. Maybe they got away with one there.",
      "\"We shot ourselves in the foot, so I won't blame the officiating.\"",
      "On only four minutes of injury time being played in the second half: \"It was back to last season, wasn’t it? I don’t know where that one came from. Man Utd are winning 2-1 so it’s four minutes.",
      "\"But I’ve got to give the players a lot of credit. They showed an air of calmness and belief, commitment to the game plan and dragged themselves to a really good performance. We got back into the game and pushed.",
      "\"There’s lots to like about the performance but you can’t give a team like Manchester United a two-goal headstart. We got punished with a couple of errors and it was hard to recover from that.\"",
      "On losing top scorer Elijah Adebayo to an injury in the warm-up: \"Losing your No 9 and then going 1-0 down after 40 seconds is not the ideal way to start against Man Utd.",
      "\"I think it rocked and wobbled us for a little bit. When 1-0 turns to 2-0 after six minutes, you're fearing the worst and you go 'how do we respond to it?'",
      "Sky Sports' Sam Blitz at Kenilworth Road:",
      "Manchester United put out two midfielders at Luton. One was 18 years old, the other a four-time Champions League winner. One of them was lucky to stay on the pitch by half-time, the other looked cool and composed.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's expert display showed Casemiro, a team-mate 13 years his senior, how it's done.",
      "Mainoo was superb as United calmed down a frantic game at Luton after half-time and hung on for a win. The midfielder won nine possessions in the defensive and middle thirds fn the pitch, more than any of his United team-mates by a country mile. He also ran past an opposition midfielder six times out of the seven times he tried it.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, failed to run past any of his opposite numbers or win a single ball in the United defensive third.",
      "As Jamie Redknapp said after the game: \"It was too much for Casemiro\" but the \"real deal\" \"Mainoo had the \"youthfulness and the presence\" to cope with it. Sunday's game at Luton could herald a changing of the guard in the United midfield.",

      "Newcastle have placed sporting director Dan Ashworth on gardening leave after an approach from Manchester United.",
      "The 52-year-old told the Tyneside club he wanted to leave on Sunday.",
      "Darren Eales, Newcastle United CEO, said on Monday: \"We are naturally disappointed that Dan has chosen to leave, however our exciting journey doesn't stop and the process to recruit a new sporting director will begin immediately.",
      "\"We thank Dan for his efforts at Newcastle United and we wish him and his family well for the future.\"",
      "Ashworth is top of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's list to front up his new football operation at Old Trafford after completing his deal for a 25 per cent stake in the club.",
      "There is yet to be a formal approach for Ashworth, but that is expected to come this week.",
      "Ashworth informed Newcastle of Man Utd's interest last weekend.",
      "Newcastle have not put a figure on Ashworth's services, but it's thought it could reach in excess of £10m should Man Utd want to buy out his contract so he can start work ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Ashworth joined Newcastle from a similar role at Brighton exactly two years ago, with Newcastle themselves paying compensation to attain him.",

      "This revamped man-for-man style that sees Ross Barkley and Albert Sambi Lokonga dictate the game in central areas has a little bit of everything in there. It's a style that is a bit Pep Guardiola mixed in with a bit of Marcelo Bielsa, sprinkled with peak Sam Allardyce when it comes to set-pieces. Teams are having trouble working it all out. Manchester United did for 10 minutes but fell in a hole when Luton got their game going. Erik ten Hag's men were lucky to get in at the break in front.",
      "Yes, Edwards' side lack quality in the final third but their underlying attacking process is functioning to a high level.

      "A favourable run of fixtures for United, which begins at Luton on Sunday - live on Sky Sports Premier League - presents Ten Hag's side with the chance to make ground on their rivals after a miserable start to the season.",

      "Ten Hag says United's limitations in the summer transfer market have slowed down their path to challenging for the Premier League title.",

      "\"They're better than they were but they're still not great. They concede so many chances, they don't really have any patterns, they don't control games or keep possession better than the other teams. But they do have players who can win matches.",

      "Keane says Tottenham and Villa will be \"getting worried\" about United picking up results, but adds that Ten Hag's forwards are getting their defenders \"out of jail\".",
      "\"United still gave up loads of chances, the problems are still there for them,\" Keane said after the Villa game. \"They got away with it today, because the attacking players are scoring goals.",
      "\"But there's no surprise the amount of chances they give up, they do it every week. They've got away with it in three or four weeks. Their attacking players are getting them out of jail.",

      "The findings reveal Erik ten Hag's squad cost a staggering £1.2bn in transfer fees last term, when this side secured a third-place finish in the Premier League, won the Carabao Cup and finished runners-up in the FA Cup.",
      "The record-breaking figure includes huge fees splashed out on Antony (£86m), Harry Maguire (£80m), Jadon Sancho (£73m) and Casemiro (£70m) - but excludes several expensive acquisitions signed last summer, who arrived after the 2022/23 financial year.",
      "European and domestic champions Manchester City sit second in the rankings with a squad cost of £1.1bn, followed by Chelsea (£927.2m, *2021/22 financial year), Real Madrid (£881.9m) and Paris Saint-Germain (£802.4m).",
      "In terms of Chelsea, that total is likely to explode for 2022/23 given the Blues have spent £1bn on new signings since it was calculated, having undertaken a record-breaking transfer splurge after Todd Boehly bought the club."

      "The 18-year-old is among the options United are monitoring, with plans to sign a striker in the summer.",
      "Tel is aware of the interest but has not yet given up hope of becoming first choice at Bayern. He will have discussions with the club in the coming weeks and, if he does not get the feeling the club believe in him, he will weigh up his options in the summer.",
      "Tel has scored six goals and made three assists in only 732 minutes of football for Bayern this season. He is up against Harry Kane and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting for playing time.",

      "Sky Sports' football writers assess the Premier League action from Saturday's games as Liverpool and Arsenal march on while Ollie Watkins makes a statement and Bruno Guimaraes looks at home in his new attack-minded role",
      "Sunday 18 February 2024 18:43, UK",
      "\"It was similar to the last couple of games at home,\" said Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou when quizzed in Saturday's post-match press conference.",
      "He admitted that Spurs have not been at the levels they want over the last few matches. Their last two at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium saw them beat Brentford and Brighton, but neither were easy or all that convincing.",
      "And against Wolves, those nervous moments that Tottenham had been able to navigate over the last few weeks - or at least, find goals to paper over the cracks - finally came back to haunt them.",
      "Despite having Heung-Min Son back in the XI alongside Richarlison, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevki, they ended the first half without a shot on target. Worryingly, only four of their 15 shots in the game overall were.",
      "But it was their inability to stop Wolves on the counter, added to some questionable defending for Joao Gomes' opener, that was their ultimate downfall. While Postecoglou insisted Spurs' defending had been 'outstanding' this season, it has not been their crowning glory in recent weeks.",
      "Now, they have a fortnight before they take on Crystal Palace. The buzz words of 'hard work', 'move on', 'be ready for the game' are all well and good, but Tottenham need to pull themselves out of a performance slump.",
      "Already slipping into fifth by two points after this defeat, that could widen even further by the time March 2 rolls around. There's still plenty of football left to play, but Tottenham will want to have their fate in their own hands heading into the business end of the season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Pep Guardiola had spoken of Chelsea's quality beforehand, describing them as \"an exceptional team\" but the suspicion was that this might be the familiar sound of the City boss praising opponents only for them to leave the Etihad Stadium on the end of a beating.",
      "But Chelsea had their tactics spot on. They knew that City would have most of the possession but if they were able to be composed when under pressure and play that extra pass rather than just clear it, the openings would appear. They managed it time and again.",
      "Cole Palmer has that calmness, Malo Gusto has the energy from deep. Nicolas Jackson and Raheem Sterling have not always been as ruthless as they should have been this season - to say the least - and they missed chances in Manchester. But the goal was superb.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino will be just as pleased by the resilience shown. Conor Gallagher ran himself into the ground. Axel Disasi came up with block after block. Chelsea lost the lead late on. But they have found their spirit recently. That could be more important in the long run.Adam Bate",
      "Erling Haaland is a fantastic player who is likely to end the season as the Premier League's top goalscorer again, provided he remains fit.",
      "But, having scored twice late on last weekend against Everton to signal his return following two months out, this was quite possibly his most frustrating evening in a Manchester City shirt. The life of a striker.",
      "Daniel Sturridge told Sky Sports: \"He goes onto the pitch with the expectation of scoring goals. He's going to go home feeling down about himself, lower than a snake's belly.\"",
      "Jamie Carragher added: \"He's probably not had a game like this in a Manchester City shirt.\"",
      "Haaland had nine shots and an xG total of 1.71 against Chelsea, his most for both without scoring in a single game for Manchester City in all competitions.",
      "It was so unusual to see the chances being squandered. Haaland has had his body language questioned by Pep Guardiola, he pushed away a camera on the pitch at the final whistle here, but what can never be in doubt is his mentality.",
      "Guardiola isn't concerned.",
      "\"I played 11 years and scored 11 goals so I can't give too much advice to Erling [Haaland]. The next one he will score.\"",
      "City have now fallen behind in eight of their last 13 Premier League matches. Rodri again delivered a big moment, but here was a reminder that they cannot rely on one man to dig them out of a hole.Ben Grounds",
      "When Julen Lopetegui left Wolves in the lurch three days before the start of the season, not many gave them hope of surviving relegation let alone having a successful season. But they had an ace up their sleeve in Gary O'Neil, whose reputation is growing with every 'big six' team they swat aside. Beating Manchester City, Chelsea and now Tottenham twice is a sensational feat.",
      "O'Neil has simply made so many of these Wolves players better. He hasn't moaned about the lack of funds to strengthen - he's just got on with his job. A tactical triumph all round.",
      "He's built a Wolves team that can be devastating on their day. Spurs saw this up close as they walked straight into the traps set by O'Neil. Pedro Neto dazzled once again, Joao Gomes scored twice, Craig Dawson led the defensive line majestically. The manager himself called their scintillating counter-attack \"the one thing we know we can do\".",
      "But he also added that Wolves now need to link differing styles of play together. Against Tottenham, they had just 29.1 per cent of possession, fewer shots and a lower xG - similar numbers, you'd imagine, against Manchester City and Chelsea too. It is clear these games are where they thrive.",
      "However, last weekend in a home defeat to Brentford, the script was flipped. They had 71.1 per cent of the ball and almost twice as many shots. Adapting to how different opponents may play against them is the next step in O'Neil's impressive Wolves evolution. With or without the ball, goals and wins are paramount.",
      "But there is one thing that is in no doubt - the future under O'Neil's watch is a bright one. Wolves have a gem.Lewis Jones and Charlotte Marsh",
      "Liverpool could have up to nine absentees ahead of next Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. Games against Man City and Everton follow soon after. Jurgen Klopp says he has problems ahead of a crunch period of the season as his side fight on four fronts.",
      "The Premier League leaders definitely didn't show that in Saturday's 4-1 win at Brentford. Mohamed Salah stole the show on his return as he delivered a goal and an assist off the bench. Cody Gakpo, another substitute, produced the same feat.",
      "Few teams could lose their biggest threats, Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez, and step up their performance. Klopp has a point, losing depth at this vital stage is potentially damaging, but he has a uniquely stacked array of forwards to cope with such an eventuality.",
      "Liverpool managed to average three goals per game in the four matches Salah missed through injury and with Nunez unlikely to be out for long, there is no reason the forwards can't step up again without Jota. Liverpool guarantee goals, whoever is playing.Zinny Boswell",
      "Arsenal began the weekend dreaming about Kylian Mbappe. They will end it questioning if they actually need him.",
      "Since the winter break, when all the talk was about whether the Gunners needed to strengthen up front, Mikel Arteta's side have 21 goals in five Premier League matches. That run includes five goals past Crystal Palace, six in the West Ham net, now five against Burnley.",
      "Still, some will claim Arsenal need that 30-goal-a-season striker. But three reasons suggest they don't.",
      "The first: among those 21 goals since January 20, there have been nine different goalscorers - showing a desire to spread firepower around the team through personnel. Arsenal don't need an Erling Haaland if they have multiple players on 15 goals and defenders contributing from set-pieces.",
      "The second: Arsenal have a starlet in Bukayo Saka who can take on the goalscoring mantle, if one star is needed. \"I have no idea, I don't think Bukayo needs much motivating,\" said Arteta after the game when asked if Saka was affected by the Mbappe links.",
      "The 22-year-old has 12 goals this season including seven in his last six league games and is right in the mix for the Golden Boot.",
      "And the third: Arsenal aren't conceding, meaning less is needed from up top. While they've scored 21 at one end, they've conceded just twice at the other. One was an own goal against Liverpool, the other a late consolation at Nottingham Forest.",
      "In short, Arsenal are looking complete.Sam Blitz",
      "While England fans lick their lips at the prospect of the Three Lions' chances at this summer's Euros, given how many players are hitting top form, Gareth Southgate must have a perpetual headache.",
      "Harry Kane still can't stop scoring for Bayern Munich, Ivan Toney is back from his ban and firing for Brentford, while Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden are just going from strength to strength.",
      "Ollie Watkins has not had too many chances to show what he's capable of on the international stage. He has earned nine caps since his debut in March 2021, but only started three times and played for more than an hour just twice.",
      "He was left out of the Euro 2020 squad and the World Cup 2022 squad, too - but there's no doubt it's time to start looking at him for this summer's squad.",
      "Against Fulham at Craven Cottage, it was his finishing masterclass that helped Aston Villa to their second Premier League win of 2024 and helped them take control of the intriguing battle to reach the top four. Another hat-trick escaped him on this occasion, but his double took him to 18 goals - his best return in four seasons in a Villa shirt.",
      "Granted, he will not be the main man. But the opportunity to take an in-form player, capable of playing as a No 9, but also out wide, to Germany should be one Southgate does not pass up.Dan Long",
      "David Moyes' supporters will point to that Europa Conference League win at the end of last season, as well as the fact that West Ham are still eighth in the Premier League despite a miserable 2024.",
      "But Moyes can't trade off that magical night in Prague forever. The reality is that his side haven't won in eight games. Their push for Europe is seriously faltering, while the style of football leaves plenty to be desired.",
      "West Ham fans must look at their contemporaries - Aston Villa and Brighton, for example - and wonder why their team can't play with similar ambition.",
      "Villa, Brighton and the like won't win every week, but they at least go down fighting. At the moment, West Ham don't even do that.",
      "With Jarrod Bowen, Michail Antonio and Mohammed Kudus leading the attack, the visitors managed just three shots on target at the City Ground.",
      "The trouble with playing the more conservative brand of football favoured by Moyes is that, when results turn, fans don't even have entertaining football to cling onto.",
      "Despite their top-half position, West Ham are comfortably in the bottom half for goals conceded, expected goals and possession percentage.",
      "That helps to explain why so many Hammers fans want to see change in the dugout. It's not just the defeats, but the manner of them that is so damaging.Joe Shread",
      "As Eddie Howe referenced after another chaotic St James' Park draw, Newcastle aren't at their best. Performances are disjointed. Howe's team charged to the Champions League last season playing a very controlled game - they have no control at the minute. There have been 41 total goals scored in their last nine games across all competitions.",
      "He's looked a little rash and unmotivated this season in his role playing at the base of Newcastle's three-man midfield but the switch to play him closer to the attackers has unleashed an exciting version of the Brazilian. He's made 23 runs into the box across his last three games, which is more than he's made in his previous 14 games combined in the Premier League, highlighting his added attacking licence. This new role is right up his street.Lewis Jones"

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly looking to build a new stadium for Manchester United; the British billionaire is set to acquire a £1.2bn stake in the club and will put £239m into the club's infrastructure; Ratcliffe wants to build a 'Wembley of the North'",
      "Friday 16 February 2024 19:07, UK",
      "Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Manchester United have said they are supporting council plans to regenerate an area surrounding Old Trafford, which includes a dedicated 'Stadium District'.",
      "But chief operating officer, Collette Roche, did not offer any indication of what that development could look like when quoted alongside Trafford Council's executive member for economy and regeneration, councillor Liz Patel.",
      "Roche said: \"We will continue to work closely with the council, and other local stakeholders, on how any future development work at Old Trafford can complement their vision and, most importantly, benefit the local community.\"",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported earlier this month Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators.",
      "The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which has moved a step closer after the FA approved the purchase.",
      "\"I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,\" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club, but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",

      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby the government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",
