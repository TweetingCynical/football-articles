      "Manchester United have been told that Matheus Cunha is \"exactly what they need\" as a £62.5million move from Wolves edges ever closer. The Brazilian already has an agreement in place with the Red Devils as the financials are thrashed out.",
      "Cunha has been a leading light at Molineux, helping steer them clear of a relegation scrap. The forward was crucial to their upturn in form throughout 2025 but is now set to be the first signing of Ruben Amorim 's summer rebuild.",
      "The Wolves star is set to compliment the 3-4-3 system that is being implemented in Manchester with ex-Red Devil Louis Saha insisting he has all the traits and the temperament to succeed at one of the world's biggest clubs.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot previously claimed Cunha was more than capable of playing for one of the Premier League's top sides and, after a 15-goal season, Saha believes he will be a shrewd addition.",
      "He told 10bet : \"Matheus Cunha is exactly what United need. He’s got speed and stamina. He’s unpredictable and he’s powerful. He’s got legs, he’s got skills, he’s got the right attitude.",
      "\"He works hard but he’s also creative. He gives the opponents a headache to try to solve the problems he poses. He can be decisive and he can cut it in the Premier League. He’s already shown that he’s good enough. Not only that, I think he can handle the pressure, and he is versatile enough to play in midfield or across the front line.\"",
      "Saha has hinted that Cunha could come in and replace Mason Mount, who has struggled for form and fitness throughout his time in Manchester. The ex-Chelsea man joined for a hefty fee but has been unable to have the desired impact and could lose out.",
      "\"That’s the kind of player that United need,\" said Saha. \"When you look at Mason Mount, who has been unlucky with injury, but he doesn’t exploit the space like Cunha does. Mount finds space, but he’s not dangerous in the pockets when he finds them. It’s disappointing from such a big signing.\"",
      "United are set for an overhaul after a dire season. They're without Europe next year but have acted quick in the market and, alongside Cunha, are making moves to land Liam Delap from Ipswich amid competition from Chelsea.",

      "Worries over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude could land him a spot on the Manchester United departures list this summer. And one former Carrington coach appeared to hint at the South American's penchant for petulance years ago.",
      "Murmurs have been building that Ruben Amorim is ready to sell Garnacho, who was dropped for United's final game of the season against Aston Villa. The Daily Mail reported that on the eve of that fixture, Amorim hung the 20-year-old out to dry in front of his team-mates and told him: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "Justin Cochrane was part of the academy setup when Garnacho helped guide United's under-18s to the FA Youth Cup crown in 2022. The Argentina international was named Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year in the same season, but his temperament perhaps didn't always match his on-field performance.",
      "Cochrane, who has since moved to become first-team coach at Brentford, stopped short of hanging his former protege out to dry. But even on the path to success three years ago, there were comments pointing to potential flaws in a then-17-year-old Garnacho's character.",
      "Speaking to Goal in March 2022 about keeping the clearly talented winger grounded, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender paralleled that comment by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. But even then, talk diverted to ensuring the player's ego remained grounded, something one might not hear unless there were already concerns in that area.",
      "\"My job and the staff’s job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" added Cochrane. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that’s what we’re focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United boss to take issue with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously reprimanded by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts critical of his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth last April.",
      "Ten Hag later said his player had apologised over the incident, suggesting they had moved on from the ordeal. However, Garnacho was later dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, not long before he was fired, for once again liking posts critical of Ten Hag.",
      "Given Cochrane's comments from 2022, it points to a pattern of behaviour most coaches would rather do without. And it appears Amorim has had the last straw, with the player seemingly free to leave if a suitable offer comes in.",
      "Napoli have been strongly linked with the player in recent transfer windows. However, that move could be in jeopardy amid reports Antonio Conte is prepared to leave the club after just one season, in which he secured the Serie A crown.",
      "That could leave the Red Devils scrambling to find a suitor for the player willing to meet their valuation. And that list could only grow shorter if teams looking to invest are at all unsettled when it comes to Garnacho's personality."

      "Antony was labelled a \"ghost\" after he failed to show up for Real Betis in the Europa Conference League final as they were beaten by Chelsea. The Spanish side took the lead, but were ultimately undone in Poland.",
      "Their Manchester United loanee had been crucial in them getting to the final, scoring a stunning goal to see off Fiorentina en route. That is one of several contributions he's made in the final third as the Brazilian continues to rediscover his best form.",
      "It has been a far cry from the Antony we've seen in Manchester with the ex-Ajax man continuing to underwhelm as he fails to deliver on his mammoth price tag. Since moving to Betis though he's been one of La Liga's most productive players.",
      "He endured an off-night in the final however and ex-Blue Frank Leboeuf claims Antony looked more like the player we've seen in Manchester for the last two years.",
      "Leboeuf told ESPN: \"It wasn’t his night. I don’t really follow La Liga except the big games but I thought Antony had a better change in his football. Today I saw the ghost that was playing for Manchester United. The only thing he did was pick fights with Enzo Fernandez.",
      "\"I was very disappointed with his game, I was expecting something more creative and dangerous. Unfortunately for Betis we didn’t see the Antony who has been good during his loan. That guy has to avoid English football, that’s it. Don’t play against English teams and don’t play for any football club in England because it doesn’t suit him.\"",
      "Antony's form in England has been a struggle ever since he moved in the summer of 2022. He found himself well down the pecking order under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim, who eventually sanctioned his loan departure.",
      "In light of his impressive form in Spain the United boss has been quizzed on the player's future. Amorim claimed it was only a good thing that Antony had gone on to thrive. \"We see our players doing well on loan in a different context. That can happen and it's a good sign for the club,\" he said.",
      "Antony's future in Manchester remains in doubt but his exploits with Betis have put him firmly in the shop window. The player himself said: \"My work is playing and I'm doing that well. I have a lot of affection for Betis, for everyone but I have a contract with Man United and I don't know what's going to happen.\"",

      "The race is on and instead of taking the steady approach of a marathoner, several of the Premier League’s giants are out of the blocks like sprinters.",
      "It was not until the third week of last summer’s transfer window that the traditional big six completed a signing - with Tosin Adarabioyo joining Chelsea as a free agent and Lucas Bergvall arriving at Tottenham from Djurgarden on July 1.",
      "But already this summer - despite the window not opening until Sunday - Manchester United have made their £62.5m move for Matheus Cunha, Liverpool have done a deal for Jeremie Frimpong with Florian Wirtz possibly following along the path from Leverkusen, and Arsenal are putting the wheels in motion to add the striker they so desperately need.",
      "The calendar is undoubtedly a factor behind this active start. Last summer’s window began the same time as the Euros, this year’s starts early and pauses briefly to factor in Chelsea and Manchester City’s participation in the Club World Cup.",
      "But it is hard to ignore the two other major circumstances prompting this early rush into action.",
      "Top of the list is the chase for goalscorers. The absence of a prolific No9 was the main reason behind Arsenal being unable to prolong their title challenge. A centre-forward capable of finding the net would have eased the crisis at United. Chelsea’s biggest weakness is the absence of a ruthless finisher. And even Liverpool have rued Darwin Nunez’s misfiring.",
      "They are all fighting for a dwindling number of strikers, which is why Liam Delap is commanding such interest after one good season for a team that won just four games all season. Chelsea are keen, so too United, and the Ipswich player’s representatives have already been holding talks with a number of clubs, pointing to a speedy resolution.",
      "Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, meanwhile, looks destined for north London as Mikel Arteta hopes to add the final piece after the Gunners’ rate of improvement slowed to incremental. That is another transfer that is expected to be completed early in the window - with the Arsenal hierarchy no doubt wary of losing out on their top target. They are also expected to announce the signing of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad early on.",
      "Yet it is not all about the supply and demand of strikers. By ending Manchester City’s era of dominance, Liverpool have opened up a window for their rivals to win a title. This time last year most clubs will have been dreaming but not necessarily believing that they could unseat Pep Guardiola’s side.",
      "Now they are all certain they can do what Arne Slot’s side managed – if they can get the recruitment right. That is why this window could have long-term repercussions, why the gap between success and failure is so thin and we could look back on 2025 a few seasons from now as a period that defined an era.",
      "And that is before considering the long-held fact that the ability to have new acquisitions report for duty at the beginning of pre-season rather than arriving a couple of games into the campaign is rather valuable. Just do not expect a hectic deadline day if the business is completed early."

      "Rashford wants to get his future sorted quickly, otherwise he will have to report for pre-season with United in early July. The problem is that he is being paid £350,000 per week by United on a contract which runs until June 2028 – terms that no other club will meet.",
      "Nevertheless, Barca appear to be interested, with SPORT reporting that the club’s sporting director Deco met with Rashford’s agent at a hotel in the city on Wednesday morning.

      "“The important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better. I liked the young kids, they try. That’s enough for me in the moment. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody to play. They did well.”",
      "United have one more friendly to come during the money-spinning tour, against the Hong Kong national team on Friday. After that, attention will turn towards strengthening a squad which only managed a 15th place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim was able to welcome two new faces in the winter window, with Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven joining from Lecce and Arsenal respectively. Matheus Cunha is set to become the first summer arrival, with United meeting the Brazil forward's £62.5million release clause.",
      "That deal isn't quite done yet, though. “You have to wait for that,\" Amorim saidr. \"I won’t confirm anything. I have no news. We will see. There will be some changes”",
      "United rounded off their league season with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday, but were unable to avoid their worst ever Premier League finish. After ending up 15th with just 42 points, their head coach apologised to the fans.",
      "\"First of all, I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and the team,\" he said. \"Secondly, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support this season and I know it was really hard to support us in many games.",
      "\"But now we have to make a choice. Do we stick in the past? Because this season is in the past. It's over. We could fight each other or we stick together and move forward.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim kept his cards close to his chest when asked about the club's pursuit of Matheus Cunha. Wolves striker Cunha is set for a medical ahead of a £62.5million Old Trafford switch, but some formalities still need to be ironed out.",
      "Cunha has made clear he is a fan of Amorim, who won titles with Sporting CP before moving to the Premier League. In a recent interview with Brazilian media, he all but confirmed his move when speaking about the United boss.",
      "\"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best,\" Cunha told CNN Brasil (via the Daily Mail). \"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal,\"",
      "When asked about linking up with the Portuguese, he added: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help,\" though Amorim is in nio mood to jump the gun.",
      "“You have to wait for that,\" Amorim told reporters during United's post-season tour. \"I won’t confirm anything. I have no news. We will see. There will be some changes”",
      "United fans were given a reminder of why their pursuit of a goalscorer like Cunha has accelerated. Amorim's side began their tour of Malaysia with a friendly against ASEAN All Stars, but fell to a 1-0 defeat in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi were given 45 minutes each in the game, with Joshua Zirkzee not involved after only recently returning from injury. Hojlund and Zirkzee scored just seven league goals between them, while teenager Obi only started his first Premier League match in May.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim also took some small positives - including predicting more minutes for young midfielder Sekou Kone. The 19-year-old, who joined from Malian side Guidars last summer, has made Premier League matchday squads on several occasions without making a senior competitive appearance.",
      "\"The important thing is no injuries, with this weather and everything that we did to arrive here in this day,\" Amorim said. \"But, again, it's not an excuse. We should perform better.",
      "\"We have to control the minutes of everybody. He [Kone] will play more in the next game on Friday. He did quite well but all the young kids tried, that is the most important thing. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody, so everybody can play. They did well.\"",

      "Kirsten Heukels, the body language consultant hired by Manchester United on a £175,000-per-year salary, has defended her role at the club amid criticism from part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Heukels joined the club during Erik ten Hag's time as manager, but was pointed to by Ratcliffe in a discussion of how the club was haemhorraging money when he arrived.",
      "One of Heukels' roles was to help United's players with penalty shoot-outs. Her background was outside football, but during her time the club secured vital shoot-out victories over Brighton and Coventry in successive FA Cup campaigns.",
      "She spoke with United's keepers during her time at Old Trafford, and also met outfield players. However, speaking to The Athletic, she claims there was no direct contact with anyone at owners INEOS.",
      "“I don’t look at life this way,” Heukels said when asked about Ratcliffe's comments. “I believe it was a courageous thing that the team did back then. And I’m proud of what we achieved.",
      "\"The achievements are in the data, so they are proven. I don’t need to explain that to anybody,\" she continued. \"I don’t know enough about him or United today because I’m not involved, but it’s always dangerous to talk about your predecessors this way.”",
      "It was back in March that Ratcliffe referenced Heukels' role and salary - albeit not her name - in an interview with The Times. In the same piece, the billionaire opened up on the financial situation affecting the club since his arrival.",
      "“If you think of it in really simple terms, you’ve got the operating costs, which are all the staff and the fixed costs of running the business,\" he said. \"And then you’ve got all the squad costs, player salaries and player purchases.",
      "“In super simple terms, the club has been spending more money than it’s been earning now for the last seven years, and it ends in a very difficult place. And for Manchester United, that place ended at the end of this year, the end of 2025, with the club running out of cash. I think it’s the first time we’ve probably said that in public, but that’s the fact of the matter.”",
      "Heukels, who also credits former United coach Steve McClaren among others for helping her during her time at Old Trafford, predominantly scouted opposition penalty takers. The 2023 Brighton shoot-out win was described as a breakthrough, while she was also in her role when David de Gea made his first Old Trafford penalty save in nine years during a match against Fulham shortly after.",
      "“I look at how they are walking up to the spot,” Heukels explains. “How their face is holding itself, because you can think you’re looking cool but your face will tell me more and you will leak it all. I will look at body language and their interaction with the goalkeeper — whether they are looking at him or not.”",

Wednesday's fixture was the first of two friendlies on United's schedule as part of a post-season tour which is set to earn the club £8million.",

      "Liverpool stepped away from a move for Matheus Cunha amid concerns about how he might fit into their squad, it has been claimed. The Brazilian international is on the verge of joining Manchester United from Wolverhampton Wanderers in a £62.5million deal after a career-best season at Molineux.",
      "Cunha ended the campaign with 15 league goals - the joint-most for a Brazilian in the Premier League, matching totals posted by Roberto Firmino and Gabriel Martinelli. He also signed a contract extension with Wolves midway through the campaign, allowing them to recoup a significant fee.",
      "This was enough to convince United to match his release clause, and there is optimism the deal can be wrapped up before Cunha links up with the Brazil squad. The forward is part of Carlo Ancelotti's first squad since taking over as head coach, with matched against Ecuador and Paraguay on the horizon in early June.",
      "There was a moment when Liverpool looked as though they might rival United for Cunha's signature. However, according to The Mail, their plans changed before the most recent offer from their fellow Premier League side.",
      "The former Atletico Madrid star is understood to have fans at Anfield, but the Reds' depth in attacking areas remained a factor. It has been claimed they weren't fully convinced when it came to how Cunha might fit into the current system, and instead have prioritised other targets.",
      "Top of that list of targets is Florian Wirtz. The Bayer Leverkusen star is being eyed up in a move which would see Liverpool pay a club record sum of £85m or more.",
      "Arne Slot's men are understood to have stolen a march on Bayern Munich, who had previously looked like the most likely winners of the transfer battle. Manchester City and Real Madrid were also mentioned in connection with the 21-year-old, but Liverpool are now leading the race - much to the frustration of Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen.",
      "\"Much more has been written than spoken,\" Dreesen told TZ (via the ECHO) before attempting what some have read as a dig at Liverpool over their failure to qualify for the upcoming Club World Cup. \"FC Bayern is one of the absolute top clubs in Europe and the world. Our appeal among fans, but also among players, is enormous.",
      "\"The fact that not every player will end up with us is simply part of the package; it's the same for other top clubs. But everyone knows: with FC Bayern, you can win everything every year, you're involved in every competition – the upcoming Club World Cup is a good example of that.",

      "Ferdinand was clear that he will now use his time to focus on other avenues, however, including his management firm 'New Era' and his blossoming production company which produces podcasts and interviews.",
      "The Mail also reported that Ferdinand could now look to move into US football (soccer) coverage with his management company recently signing an agreement with William Morris Endeavor (WME), who represent a number of American celebrities such as Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds from their base in Beverly Hills.",
      "There is certainly a growing demand for Premier League greats offering their insights in the US. The likes of Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Micah Richards have been highly successful on their CBS show, while NBC Sports have brought in Gary Neville this season.",
      "Ferdinand could be looking to follow suit, especially with the 2026 World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico right on the horizon, which is set to bring a fresh audience to the sport in North America.",
      "Ferdinand’s social media statement also indicated that his decision partly stemmed from wanting to spend more time with his family, having said: “I’m excited about what the future holds, spending more time with my family focusing on Rio Ferdinand Presents and my other business interests.”",
      "It follows a report from The Sun last month which suggested Ferdinand and his wife, Kate, are looking to move to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. It was claimed that the couple have already started looking at properties and schools in Dubai, having reportedly decided that now is the right time for them and their family to relocate.",
      "They share two children together, while Kate is also a stepmother to the footballer's three children from his previous marriage to late wife Rebecca Ellison, who died from cancer in 2015. It was also claimed that they will travel back and forth to the UK to fulfil their work commitments, with Kate being the founder of podcast and online platform ‘blended’. However, those reported plans to quit the UK altogether have not been publicly confirmed by Ferdinand.",
      "In a video posted on X, a Liverpool fan account posted a video in which he said: \"Look, football fans have had enough of the likes of Ferdinand and others. They've had enough of bitter commentators not having any neutrality in the job that they're doing.",
      "\"You don't need people like Rio Ferdinand there commentating on a Liverpool game knowing that he doesn't want to see you do anything or win anything. He should be behind the English club. But as is always the case with these commentators, their previous bias creeps in. Let me just say this wholeheartedly, f*** you Rio.\"",
      "Ferdinand wasted no time in responding to the foul-mouthed critique, writing: \"I wasn’t on the gantry when Liverpool scored. Like in the 1st half where I left the commentary position to go back down Pitchside after 36 minutes. I was asked to do the same in the 2nd half prior to the goal. Thanks.\"",
      "Savage defended Ferdinand by saying: “Some of the comments questioned whether Rio’s contribution was impartial given his 455 appearances and 10 major trophies, including six titles, as a United player. But I defy anyone – whether you played the game for United or another club - not to be excited by such an extraordinary finish.",
      "\"Football is an emotional game, and if co-commentators convey their passion when they are watching something sensational, they are only reflecting what viewers are feeling in their armchairs at home. Whether or not you approved of our antics caught on the TNT ‘comms cam’, surely you can’t look at something so incredible and remain indifferent.",
      "\"Rio is a United legend who knows the club, how it works and who calls the shots. He is not going to sit on his hands and sound like he’s reading the shipping forecast when his old team goes from 4-2 down with six minutes left to a 5-4 win. It’s not bias, it’s human emotion.\"",
      "Ferdinand and other pundits also came under fire for their strong criticism of the England men's national team’s performances at Euro 2024, where the Three Lions were lacklustre for much of the tournament despite reaching the final.",
      "He said on an episode of Rio Ferdinand Presents: “If there’s been below par performances, there’s no way that you can expect anyone, us as pundits or fans, to sit there and go, ‘Well done guys – pat on the back.' I played in tournaments where we didn’t do well. I never expected anybody to then come out with positive comments. I don’t think in any industry you work in, if you don’t perform, that you’d expect anything other than criticism.\"",
      "Ferdinand was unfortunately unable to cover Arsenal’s Champions League visit to Paris Saint-Germain last month after being rushed to hospital. The Red Devils icon posted a selfie from a hospital bed on social media with the caption: “Gutted to be missing the Semi-Finals this week on @tntsportsfootball! Wishing the team all the best — I’ll be watching every minute from the iPad!\"",
      "Having received plenty of well-wishes from fans, the former centre-back later revealed he had suffered from a nasty virus, which made him think he was even going to die. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: \"I had a mad virus. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously.",
      "“I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn't even open my eyes. Then, the headache I had… I don't get migraines or nothing else so I don't know what they're like. I thought my head was in a vice and my eyes were going to pop out. Then, I was being sick, projectile vomiting in the toilet, I got back to bed and I was having vertigo. I was holding onto the sheets, I didn't know where I was. It was crazy.\"",
      "He added: \"I had to go to hospital and the doctor even said to me, 'Do you want an ambulance?' So that's when I knew. He went, 'We're going to get your brain scanned.' I thought it was a virus or a flu or something so when he mentioned brain scan and the ambulance, the panic was nuts. I went to hospital and I was in there for a few days. I couldn't even enjoy the hospital food. The soup and the ice cream normally does wonders.\"",
      "That will be alongside its other offerings, which includes the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Women’s Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League and National League, domestic and European club rugby, MotoGP, NBA, UFC and boxing. BT Sport, as it was previously called, won exclusive rights to all live Champions League fixtures and highlights back in 2018.",

      "The England youth international has a £30million release clause in his contract with Ipswich Town, who were relegated from the Premier League this season. Delap still managed to score 12 goals for the Tractor Boys, boosting his stock after three promising spells in the Championship on loan from Manchester City.",
      "But there are doubts for Delap's suitability for United. Boss Ruben Amorim already has two young strikers in his squad - Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund - neither of whom have been prolific since joining the Red Devils one and two years ago respectively. It's feared that adding another relatively inexperienced striker could exacerbate the problems which Amorim is already facing.",
      "That's why former United midfielder Darren Gibson believes that 'established striker' Osimhen would be a better option. \"Honestly? I don't think Liam Delap is an upgrade on Zirkzee or Hojlund,\" Gibson told AceOdds.com. \"They're both so young and they've come in at a difficult time.",
      "\"Normally young strikers would have a more experienced striker to learn from and bounce off them. If United had bought Harry Kane two summers ago I think Hojlund or Zirkzee would be different players learning from him.",
      "\"I don't mean to take anything away from Delap but I don't think he's an upgrade. Rio [Ferdinand] spoke about the pressure at United recently and how players don't realise how difficult it is.",
      "\"Right now Delap is at Ipswich and there's not much pressure on him. He's playing with freedom but it's different at United. They need an established striker.",

      "Should Manchester United sign Liam Delap or Victor Osimhen? Give us your pick in the comments section.",
      "Osimhen is set to be available this summer after a goal-laden loan spell with Galatasaray. The 26-year-old had a falling out with parent club Napoli after firing them to the Serie A title in 2023.",
      "In Turkey, Osimhen has scored 36 goals in 40 games so far. Gala have already won a league and cup double this term, and they'll face Istanbul Basaksehir on Friday looking to extend their 11-point gap to second-place Fenerbahce.",
      "Osimhen's future is a major talking point in Istanbul, with Premier League rivals Chelsea, Saudi Arabian champions Al-Hilal and Italian giants Juventus linked alongside United. The Napoli star has remained tight-lipped on his future, last addressing the topic in February.",
      "\"I don't know [about the future], to be honest,\" Osimhen admitted. \"A few months ago, nobody ever thought I would come to Galatasaray, despite how big of a club they are.",
      "\"I live for the moment. [As] for what's going to happen in the summer, I don't know, but I want everyone to understand something: I really love this club so much. I love the fans, I love everyone associated with this club, from the president down to the coaching staff.\""

      "And third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton had to pick the ball out of his net midway through the second period when Burmese winger Lwin - who has two goals in 20 games in the Thai league - got on the end of Adrian Segecic's defence-splitting pass to score the only goal. United next face a Hong Kong selection on Friday afternoon in similarly difficult conditions.",
      "Here are the talking points from another strange and dispiriting day for Amorim and his team.",

      "And when he got on the end of a deep corner there was a big roar despite no real danger being created.",
      "The sight of Maguire being substituted in a quadruple change after half an hour was a major disappointment, then. Though at least for his sake he was not around when United went behind.",
      "That change also coincided with United beginning to (briefly) play some cohesive football. They were second best for the opening 30 minutes with Ayden Heaven particularly given the runaround by Hai Long Nguyen.",

      "It is hard to be anything nearing positive about Rasmus Hojlund, whose first touch and control was all over the place in another grim struggle for the centre-forward.",
      "He is sapped of confidence and needs a big reset. But whether that is possible in the off-season remains to be seen.",

      "He may have reportedly been told to find a new club after being left on the bench until late against Tottenham last week but he came on here and did actually put some work in down the left flank when many of those around him barely made an impact.",

The Red Devils also fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao, denying them a place in the Champions League next term.",

However, ex-United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster still thinks Amorim will not last long after voicing doubts about his ability to turn the club's fortunes around.",

If they don't get off to a good start [next season], which I don't see how they can, I think he's gone after a dozen games.\"",
      "Amorim expressed his regret at how United's season turned out after their final game against Aston Villa. Addressing fans at Old Trafford from the pitch, he said: \"First of all, I want to apologise. It was really disappointing with the team. Secondly, I want to say thank you.",
      "\"We are very grateful for your support during the season. I know it was really hard to support us in many games. But now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. Because this season is in the past, it's over.",

      "United have already started preparing for a busy summer as Amorim looks to revamp his squad. Matheus Cunha is on the cusp of joining the club in a £62.5million move from Wolves, while Ipswich Town forward Liam Delap has also been identified as a key target.",
      "The release clauses of Cunha and Delap combined amount to £92.5m, which have influenced United's swift decision-making. However, the club will also need to move players on to raise funds if more new signings are to be realised.",

Speaking at a press conference during the club's post-season tour of the Far East, he said: \"Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad and we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course.",
      "\"But our big plan is to improve the team that we have and is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future. It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.\"",

      "Arsenal and Manchester United fans are buzzing at the prospect of Viktor Gyokeres joining their ranks this summer. And certain members of his inner circle have already given some considerable clues concerning his transfer fate.",
      "The ex-Coventry star has thrived since joining Sporting Lisbon almost two years ago, having signed for the club under current United boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres has propelled the Lions to back-to-back Primeira Liga triumphs and topped the scoring charts in both campaigns, bagging an impressive 54 goals in all competitions this term.",
      "Sporting's dramatic comeback to secure a 3-1 victory over Benfica and lift the Taca de Portugal saw the Swede bag a pivotal 101st-minute penalty that forced extra time. Partner Ines Aguiar was at the game and found herself swamped by eager fans, all desperate for a scoop on her beau's future.",
      "Amid the frenzy, Lisbon-born actress Aguiar reportedly assured the clamouring crowd and media that he would be staying put, according to A Bola, as she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting.",
      "The sway of a significant other can't be underestimated when it comes to transfers, but the Emirates has some significant edge over Old Trafford in terms of its current allure. Arsenal will return to Champions League contention next term, while United's fall to Tottenham in the Europa League final means they won't play European football of any kind.",
      "The Gunners reportedly entered discussions with Gyokeres' agent this week after Correio da Manha said representatives had jetted to Lisbon. Mikel Arteta caught criticism for failing to add another forward to his ranks last summer, but appears to be on the front foot in correcting that error this time around.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres' uncle, Chris, dished the details on his nephew's future during a chat with the media ahead of the Taca de Portugal final. He divulged the Gyokeres family met up for dinner the night before, where the star's transfer future was a hot topic.",
      "And Uncle Chris wasn't shy about sharing his views from that discussion, albeit perhaps with a pinch of personal bias. Since Gyokeres settled into life at Estadio Jose Alvalade in 2023, his relatives have come to love Lisbon, and Chris went so far as to say the family agreed their golden child should continue calling the city his home.",
      "\"Yes, very much,\" he told Sport.TV, when asked if he and the family felt a connection to Lisbon. \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "The desires of Gyokeres' family won't concern Arsenal or United as much as the player's intentions, given that he will make the final decision. The Red Devils have at least one edge, given Amorim's shared history with the player, but United are no longer the same attraction they once were.",
      "And in fact the team may have already accepted defeat in the race amid word United seem close to bagging Wolves forward Matheus Cunha for £62.5million. Premier League rivals Chelsea are also understood to be eyeing a move for Gyokeres and can offer the Champions League football he'd desire.",
      "Sporting don't appear to be in a rush to sell their prized asset, believed to be on the market for £60m. At a recent press event set up by Radio Renascenca's Bola Branca, vice-president Francisco Salgado Zenha provided some clarity on the matter.",
      "\"Gyokeres? He has three more years on his contract,\" he said. \"At the moment, there are no offers. He has three more years on his contract. I think the answer has been given.\""

      "Liam Delap could get his hands on the number 19 shirt at Manchester United following Raphael Varane's exit and subsequent retirement in 2024. The Red Devils are at the beginning of a major squad turnover this summer, with current manager Ruben Amorim planning to \"improve the team we have\" from the starting eleven all the way through to the academy.",
      "One star that Amorim is reportedly keen to bring in is Ipswich Town striker Delap. He is likely to appear in the transfer market this summer following the club's relegation at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 12 goals and assisted twice in his most recent campaign and is available for £30million due to a relegation clause written into Delap's contract with Ipswich.",
      "Delap has reportedly been in contact with several clubs, including Chelsea, Everton, Newcastle and United, ahead of the transfer window opening.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have agreed to the framework of a deal for the young attacker, including an outline of personal terms with Delap's agents. While other Premier League sides are interested in his services, United could sway Delap towards Old Trafford by offering him a sweetener in the form of his chosen shirt number.",
      "Across his professional career, Delap has opted for the number 19 while representing Ipswich in the Premier League and also during his international career with England's youth squads. Other digits used include 20 with Hull City and seven with Preston North End, but he has seemingly settled on 19 as his preferred squad number for the future.",
      "And United are in luck, as this shirt is currently available on the list of vacancies in their squad. The number 19 was most recently used by high-profile signing Varane, who exited the squad for Como in last year's summer transfer window before retiring just weeks later in September 2024.",
      "Before his exit last summer, Varane was one of the highest earners in United's team, with the Mail reporting that the Frenchman was earning up to £350,000-a-week since signing a contract in 2021.",
      "Other players who utilised the same number as Varane in the past include current United star Amad Diallo and out-of-favour forward Marcus Rashford.",
      "However, it seems like Amorim is going for a more modest squad ahead of the 2025/26 season after their humiliating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Speaking ahead of United's preseason tour through Malaysia and Hong Kong, the Red Devils boss has admitted that the club had two plans based on what went down in Bilbao earlier in May. He said: \"We always prepare two plans.",
      "\"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad. We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Following the 1-0 loss to Spurs that cemented trophyless United's exit from European football for the upcoming campaign, Amorim insists that his team will take their lessons from previous games and look to move forward as soon as possible.",
      "He added: \"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter. It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",

      "Maung Maung Lwin is not a household name, but he might become famous in Malaysia after taking the scalp of United. The result of the post-season friendly does not matter, although there were a few interesting aspects of the contest, including the involvement of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Ruben Amorim made wholesale changes at the interval and Garnacho was introduced, despite having been told before the final day of the season he could find a new club this summer.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Speaking before the Aston Villa match, Amorim confirmed that Garnacho would still travel on the post-season tour. It's possible that the only reason Garnacho has been included on the trip is to protect his transfer value.",
      "Garnacho was omitted from the squad on the final day of the campaign, but he was still given minutes against ASEAN All-Stars, which suggests to the outside world that it's business as usual.",
      "The reality is the relationship between Garnacho and Amorim seems to have broken down, and if that is the case, it damages United's power in negotiations in the summer window.",
      "Garnacho could potentially fetch a transfer fee of £70million, but suitors will submit lower offers if they know United want to sell the winger because Amorim wants him out of the door.",
      "That means including Garnacho on the post-season tour and giving him minutes is perhaps a clever ploy to protect his value. Interested clubs, like Napoli and Chelsea, will probably see right through the tactic, but it's better to have Garnacho involved with the first team than frozen out.",
      "It's obviously difficult to sell a player for their market value when a public decision has already been communicated, so Amorim must do what he can to protect his bargaining power.",
      "Garnacho was pictured with a huge smile when the post-season team photo was taken at Manchester Airport, but he didn't look quite so cheery during exchanges with Malaysian fans the day before facing ASEAN All-Stars - it must be added that a long-distance flight and more games after a draining season are enough to leave any player feeling glum.",
      "It's a shame to see Garnacho's time at Old Trafford end on a sour note, if indeed he does leave this summer, but he has crossed managers on too many occasions. Amorim has reiterated he is still a United player, which seems in name only.",
      "Garnacho's last game for United looks set to be on tour in Hong Kong this week."

      "Maguire wore the armband from the start against ASEAN All-stars because Bruno Fernandes was named on the bench, and he handed the captain's armband to Mainoo before walking off.",
      "Mainoo had never worn the armband for United's first team, so this was the first time he was given the privilege of captaining his boyhood club. Last season, club insiders considered Mainoo as a future captain, but this season has been stop-start for the midfielder and he faces an uncertain future this summer.",
      "It will be fascinating to see how Mainoo's next few months unfold. A compromise needs to be reached in contract negotiations, otherwise, he could genuinely leave the club.",
      "Lacey gets an opportunity",
      "Shea Lacey has missed a lot of time on the pitch this season, but he will look to make up for lost time in pre-season and it was excellent to see him included in the post-season squad.",
      "Although Lacey has trained with the first-team on several occasions, the post-season tour is a new opportunity for him and he was introduced to the game when the first changes were made.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest, with followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have already been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",
      "The set-piece conundrum",
      "Carlos Fernandes is the coach who looks after set-pieces and he steps up to the touchline when there is a dead-ball situation, a routine that didn't change against ASEAN All-stars.",
      "That suggested United were approaching the game seriously. Fernandes would have been forgiven for taking a seat on the bench for the full game, but he jumped to his feet to observe each set-piece.",
      "United conceded 13 goals from corners in the Premier League during the season, which ranks them among the league's worst at defending corners, and that must improve in 2025/26."

      "Ruben Amorim's need for athletic and pacey wing-backs saw him turn to Amad early on in his United tenure, though the Ivory Coast star has tended to be used as one of the two No.10s. Patrick Dorgu has struggled to really give United the attacking threat they need from the left wing and so Amorim could move Amad back to right wing-back to ensure United carry a threat on one of the flanks.",
      "Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui could both fill in at wing-back but neither should be considered a viable option. Both are far better suited to a place in the back three and so they should not form part of United's best wing-back options.",
      "Harry Amass has settled into the first team set-up well and can provide adequate cover for Dorgu, perhaps even pushing him for a start. With Diogo Dalot another option, United should be well-stocked in the wing-back roles. Tyrell Malacia definitely needs to be sold.",
      "If Amad is moved back into the right wing-back role and United complete the sales they are looking to make this summer, Amorim may opt to use Bruno Fernandes as one of the two No.10s rather than as a central midfielder - even if Matheus Cunha arrives - and so at least one midfielder needs to be brought in.",
      "Atalanta ace Ederson is attracting attention from across Europe and his style of play would make him a perfect fit for Amorim's system. He is said to be available for £65million and would be a real statement signing given the calibre of clubs monitoring the Brazilian.",
      "Ederson could start alongside Manuel Ugarte and there's a hope that Kobbie Mainoo can maintain fitness and make himself part of that conversation next season. There's a chance United could cash-in on Mainoo but his talent is clear and they should be doing all they can to keep hold of him.",
      "United can't be deceived by Casemiro's heroics en route to the Europa League final. The Brazilian midfielder needs to be moved on this summer. That would still leave United with two options in every position across the midfield, with the adaptability of the likes of Fernandes meaning they would still have cover if multiple players were unavailable.",

      "Lasts summer, Chelsea signed Sancho on loan with an obligation agreement to sign him permanently, but they could make the extraordinary decision to break that contract.",
      "Sources have confirmed Chelsea would have to pay 'a significant fee' if they wish to break their agreement, which is believed to be £5million. It is practically unheard of for a club to break such an agreement and it would be embarrassing for Sancho to be sent back to Manchester.",
      "Sancho made a bright start at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea supporters waxed lyrical about their 'bargain signing', but the 25-year-old has suffered a poor second half of the campaign.",

      "Antony has become one of Europe's most in-form wingers at Real Betis, Elanga has been excellent in the Premier League and McTominay has won the Scudetto with Napoli in Italy.",
      "Sancho has contributed three goals and five assists in the league, which is similar to his former output at United, and he's the only player not to have improved since departing Old Trafford.",
      "That suggests Sancho is at fault for his decline just as much as the environment at United."

      "In better news, the list of players being linked with moves to Old Trafford continues to grow. Bryan Mbeumo, Ederson, Benjamin Sesko, Victor Osimhen, Hugo Ekitike and Moise Kean are all players reportedly on their radar.",

      "It meant Antony did not get the fairytale conclusion to his Betis loan spell he was looking for. He joined the Spanish outfit in January and had played a key role in helping them reach the final, scoring four goals and registering three assists in eight knockout appearances.",
      "Overall, the Brazilian, who joined Betis on a straight loan deal without an option to buy, scored nine times and racked up five assists in 26 games for the Spanish outfit, who have already made it clear that they hope to sign him again this summer.",
      "However, ahead of the transfer window officially opening for business on Sunday, the winger, who joined United from Ajax in September 2022, has admitted he is currently unsure what will happen, despite insisting he has been \"very happy\" in Seville.",

      "Manchester United's season was not bookended by silverware, after all. After the Snapdragon Cup in pre-season, the Maybank Cup eluded them in the post-season tour.",
      "Neither would ever be housed in the Old Trafford museum or featured as attractions for picture opportunities as part of the stadium tour. Ruben Amorim looked uncomfortable enough to be standing behind the Maybank Cup at Tuesday's pre-match press conference.",
      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",
      "There was a Sergio Aguero in the ASEAN All-Stars line-up, but it wasn’t that one. Instead, Maung Maung Lwin wrote his name into Malaysian football folklore as the matchwinner against United.",
      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",
      "They sang ‘Glory glory Man United’ in the stands. In a season that could not end soon enough for United, it goes on, on, on."

I felt when we finished every time the supporters were with us. Let's see for next season.",

      "The crowd are unfailingly enthusiastic and wowed by the mere presence of United players young and old. The stadium has filled up a little more since kick-off and the lower blocks behind the goals are packed to the rafters.",
      "It's 31 degrees and the players' shirts are already sticking to their bodies. Considering the temperature, the pace and intensity of the game is decent, although the quality in the final third has lacked.",
      "United youngster Munro has just conceded a foul about 35 yards from goal for dragging Dukuly to the turf. He escaped a booking and the effort from Hai Long went miles over the bar.",

      "However, it is understood there is a £5m break clause that can be paid to pull out of the deal which would see Sancho return to Old Trafford. If that does happen, it's understood that he won't be reintegrated back into the United squad.",

      "Against Betis, Sancho came off the bench and scored an impressive goal to help Chelsea win 4-1 to become the first team to win all three of Europe's club competitions. And after the win, Maresca was once again asked about the 25-year-old.",
      "\"I said yesterday in the press conference,\" he explained. \"From now on we are going to sit with the club and decide what happens for next year.",
      "\"If we finish fourth, it is also because of Jadon, if we win tonight it is also because of Jadon. It is normal in a season to go a little bit up and down, it is part of the game.\""

The winger made a bright start to life at Stamford Bridge with four assists in his first three Premier League games for Enzo Maresca's side.",
      "But that form has only proven to be fleeting, with the former Borussia Dortmund star becoming an anonymous presence on the pitch for much of 2025, with just a single goal and assist this year for Chelsea in the league.",
      "It's why there is so much talk of the Blues exercising their option to opt out of an obligation to buy Sancho this summer. Paying a £5m penalty fee is sensible instead of paying potentially four times that amount for a player who has shown little promise at Stamford Bridge.",
      "It feels increasingly possible that Sancho will become United's problem once again this summer when he returns for the club's pre-season in July.",
      "Yet there is a scenario in which he could end up staying in West London, in what would be a welcome relief for United. The 25-year-old started Chelsea's most recent game on Sunday against Nottingham Forest - arguably their most important fixture of the campaign.",
      "The 1-0 win at Forest secured a place in next season's Champions League and a £100m cash boost. Sancho starting such a crucial game indicates that Maresca has some trust in United's loanee.",
      "If he starts Wednesday's final against Real Betis and goes on to perform well, could that be enough to convince Chelsea to sign him permanently? The emotion of winning a first major trophy since 2021, even if it is Europe's third-tier competition, could sway their decision.",
      "United know all about how powerful winning silverware can be to making major football decisions. Ineos' decision to keep Erik ten Hag last summer was heavily influenced by the Reds' famous FA Cup win over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium.",
      "It still feels unlikely that Sancho will be at Chelsea next season, but there could still be one last opportunity for that change. The power brokers at Old Trafford will be praying for their on-loan forward to show his worth in Wroclaw, Poland tonight."

      "\"Obviously as a footballer you are always going to listen and hear about some rumours, but I have a contract here until 2028 so I am happy here.\"",
      "Uncertainty over Alejandro Garnacho's future at Manchester United has filled many column inches over the past few weeks. But the forward made clear he was happy at United just three weeks ago when speaking alongside Ruben Amorim ahead of the Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Plenty has changed since then. The 20-year-old hasn't started a United game since the 4-1 second leg win over Athletic. The defeats to West Ham and Chelsea were dead rubber Premier League games, but it seemed unlikely Amorim would throw Garnacho back into the starting XI against Tottenham in the Europa League final after nearly two weeks without a start. And so it proved.",
      "Garnacho was named on the bench for the showpiece event, being brought on in the 70th minute of United's listless defeat. His frustration boiled over when speaking after the game.",
      "\"I played every round to help the team reach the final, and today I only got 20 minutes… I don’t know,\" he told ESPN Argentina.",
      "\"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next. This season was s***, losing the final and not beating anyone in the league.\"",
      "Now, it must be added that Garnacho is still only 20 and allowances should be made when players are speaking in the heat of the moment. But this isn't the first time the youngster has risked the wrath of his manager since his first-team breakthrough and there comes a point when a line must be drawn.",
      "He was told he was free to leave the club following the outburst, and as much as he is a talented player who United should be keen to build a team around, if Amorim is going to build a squad capable of getting United back to where they want to be then character and professionalism will be key.",
      "Nobody of a United persuasion wants to see a talented player like Garnacho leave the club, but if he can publicly declare his happiness at the club and then U-turn just weeks later, perhaps it's best for both parties to go their separate ways."

      "The Portuguese manager has endured a difficult spell at Old Trafford since taking over in November. Under the 40-year-old's leadership, United have secured only eight Premier League wins after he succeeded Erik ten Hag, culminating in their worst-ever finish in 15th place.",
      "The Red Devils also suffered a disappointing 1-0 loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao, denying them Champions League football next season. Despite a dismal season, Amorim has received backing from the club's owners to continue in his role, following reported crisis talks in Monaco after the defeat to Spurs.",
      "United are gearing up for a summer of change, with Matheus Cunha understood to be close to sealing a £62.5million transfer from Wolves. Meanwhile, some players are expected to be offloaded to generate funds for further signings.",
      "However, Amorim has admitted that any squad revamp could be limited after being quizzed at a press event held as part of United's post-season tour in the Far East.",
      "He said: \"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.\"",
      "It was a candid moment from Amorim and former United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster believes his honesty could be a problem for the club. The ex-England international suggested it had provided players with \"excuses\" for subpar performances.",
      "Despite having the backing of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other club executives, Foster also cautioned Amorim that his tenure at United may be short-lived if he fails to impress next season.",
      "\"Amorim just constantly comes out and he's too honest, he's too emotional and he's too open,\" Foster said on his Fozcast podcast. \"I think it gives the Man United players excuses. It gives them a psychological excuse to not produce and to not come up with the three points at the end of the game.",
      "\"If they don't get off to a good start [next season], which I don't see how they can, I think he's gone after a dozen games.\" Amorim displayed his remorse to fans for United's awful campaign following their 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season.",
      "Speaking directly from the Old Trafford pitch, he said: \"First of all, I want to apologise. It was really disappointing with the team. Secondly, I want to say thank you.",
      "\"We are very grateful for your support during the season. I know it was really hard to support us in many games. But now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. Because this season is in the past, it's over.",

      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho were already out of dodge. Alejandro Garnacho has been swiftly and decisively dealt with after his unburdening in the San Mames mixed zone.",
      "Eleven years ago, Louis van Gaal bullishly said, “I don’t need a holiday” at his unveiling by United, four days after leading the Netherlands to fourth place at the 2014 World Cup. That was the last time United were gearing up for a season devoid of European football.",
      "Amorim insists he does not need to “disconnect” from the summer activity back at base. “It was important to finish the season, that was important,” he noted. “We needed to close that chapter.",
      "“It’s not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for questions! So I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "“But to tell the truth, I closed that chapter. I’m excited. I’m nervous. I want to work to the next season. So I don’t have a feeling that I need to disconnect.",
      "“I had the feeling to close the season but now it’s a new season. So I’m excited. I don’t need to rest. I just need to prepare for next season.”",
      "Apart from the presence of four journalists from Manchester, Amorim had a new audience in Kuala Lumpur. He and Mason Mount arrived to the sound of ‘Glory glory Man United’, a song that was not played in Bilbao or Manchester last week.",
      "The media WhatsApp group for the friendly with ASEAN All-Stars has 61 members. Hundreds of fans have been milling around the United hotel, pens and smartphones in hand for signed or photographic mementoes.",
      "Amorim was in a gracious mood given that this week is akin to a detention for the worst United squad in 51 years. Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi accidentally entered the eighth-floor room reserved for the press conference and were redirected elsewhere before local media could get a picture of them.",
      "United first visited Malaysia in 1995 and there was already an established supporters’ club. The signing session at the team’s hotel had to be abandoned following overcrowding amid intense demand. That was David Beckham’s first exposure to anorak fans familiar with him through United's official magazine.",
      "A United official half-joked that they did not know what day it was after the Sunday evening flight from Manchester. A few players in one of the lifts were complaining about the commercial activities they had been subjected to. Amorim was more statesman-like.",
      "“It's amazing to see, even in difficult seasons, to see how many fans this club has,” he enthused. “It's our duty to be here, it's a pleasure.",
      "“They are outside, following this club for many years and it’s really important to have that connection. It makes this club one of the best clubs in the world, so we are happy to be here.”",
      "United are raking in £8million from their two games with ASEAN All-Stars and a Hong Kong XI. Omar Berrada, the chief executive, is here in Kuala Lumpur but the technical director Jason Wilcox isn’t.",
      "Amorim’s alarm was not related to Matheus Cunha or Liam Delap. “I have the phone always on silent,” Amorim apologised. “Especially on this occasion. It's a house alarm. When I'm away, I like to control my kids!”",
      "There are seven kids on tour with United who are yet to make their debut. Godwill Kukonki, Reece Munro, Jaydan Kamason and Jack Moorhouse have made the bench before but this is unchartered territory for Jim Thwaites, Shea Lacey and Tyler Fletcher.",
      "The injury-plagued Lacey, 18, started four games for the academy all season but he already has a large profile on Instagram, with 117,000 followers. He recently deleted every post.",
      "His is a selection that a cynic would say is commercial-led. United claimed they were carefully managing Lacey’s injury as of March. Now he is making a 6,500-mile round trip to Asia. United sources insist Lacey has been picked on merit, as all the youngsters have been.",
      "\"It’s a good opportunity to see the young players,\" Amorim remarked. \"And sometimes we have surprises like Ayden (Heaven) every time he played he proved that he’s a first-team player.",
      "“I think one of the issues sometimes with youngsters is we push too much from the beginning. That sometimes is really hard.",
      "“You have social media, all this pressure around young kids, sometimes it’s hard to control. I don’t want to say any name (to look out for). I believe in all of them and, sometimes like I said, you have surprises.",
      "“My job is to give the tools and the opportunities for the young kids, try to protect them. This is a massive club.",

      "Manchester United have been treading on rakes in the transfer market for a decade now; selling Bruno Fernandes would be the most catastrophic mis-step yet.",
      "Apparently, the clock is ticking on Al-Hilal’s offer to make Fernandes their marquee player ahead of the Club World Cup. That in isolation is not an offer that you would expect to tempt the United captain. But £700,000 a week is a sweetener few could simply dismiss without serious consideration.",
      "If Fernandes is turned on by the prospect of selling his wares in Saudi, then United could expect to receive an offer of around £100million for their skipper. The response should be a firm and final ‘no’.",
      "No doubt the prospect of immediately filling the black hole in the books dug in Bilbao will appeal to the bean counters at Old Trafford. But at some point amid the scrimping and saving, they have to remember they are a football club. And without Fernandes they might have been a football club playing Championship football next season.",
      "The skipper’s influence cannot be overstated. Not only does he make this iteration of United something close to watchable, but he was involved in 40% of their goals last season, continuing his frankly ludicrous consistency with 19 goals and 20 assists in a team that for large swathes of the season had forgotten how to score.",
      "How would United replace Fernandes’ productivity if they took the Saudi cash? Lord knows the answer doesn’t lie within. They would have to spend the same again to gamble on getting anything like the same output from a new recruit, completely defeating the purpose of the sale. And would you back anyone at Old Trafford to pick a winner these days, let alone one to produce on Fernandes’ scale?",
      "There can be no ignoring United’s need for cash this summer. These days, stories of cutbacks rival transfer gossip for sheer volume. INEOS and the Glazers have shown that anyone is fair game, but assuming they wish one day to be taken seriously again as a football club, a line has to be drawn somewhere in the dressing-room, even if only around the pegs of Fernandes’ and Amad Diallo.",
      "You could make a reasonable argument for selling any other player. If Ruben Amorim really thinks so little of Kobbie Mainoo, or United were offered a profit on Leny Yoro, you might pick through the logic while saying goodbye through gritted teeth.",
      "So with almost a squad’s worth of players to take to market, United for the first time in over a decade need to sell smartly. And there’s nothing remotely clever about selling your best player and severely weakening Amorim’s ranks in one misguided motion.",
      "Amorim stated his case when he was asked about selling his captain earlier this month…",
      "“No, it’s not going to happen. He’s not going anywhere because I’ve already told him! I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He’s 30, but he’s still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he’s there for 30 at least, so he’s the type of player we want here and he’s not going anywhere.”",
      "The beleaguered boss is already having a hard time asserting his authority while hiding his disdain for the group at his disposal. If United vetoed Amorim over Fernandes, the manager might as well follow the captain through the exit door.",
      "During his seven months in charge, Amorim has repeatedly backed Fernandes in the face of criticism from outside Old Trafford, most strikingly when it came again from one of the current captain’s predecessors. Roy Keane is among the many who take issue with Fernandes and his flailing arms. But if Keane was leading this mob, blood would spatter the dressing room walls. Actually, Keane would most likely have walked away long ago in fury at his team-mates’ inability to match his standards. And few would blame Fernandes for doing the same. He really is better than this.",
      "MORE MAN UTD OPINION FROM F365\n👉 Man Utd and Spurs insulated from failure; Premier League needs its jeopardy back\n👉 Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "If he is to leave United, it certainly should not be for Saudi. Fernandes, aged 30, remains at his peak and merits a stage like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich – or a post-banter era United should they ever emerge from it – before easing into retirement in an exhibition league if that path appeals.",
      "But, for now, it seems like Fernandes is keen to stay and be part of the rebuild. Selling him would be the clearest signal yet from United that they are no longer a serious football club.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been told that they should “push” Bruno Fernandes “out” of the club if they receive a £100m “offer” from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Jamie Redknapp has picked out a “game-changer” in Manchester United’s squad for INEOS to sell this summer amid interest from elsewhere.",
      "The Man Utd players have pleaded with Bruno Fernandes to remain at Old Trafford amid interest from Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly ‘open’ to joining Al-Hilal this summer after the Red Devils’ loss in the Europa League final.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has offered to fall on his sword for Manchester United this summer and admits sacking Ruben Amorim would be the “easy” decision."

      "United ‘would also be delighted to exchange Fermin Lopez’, who’s also valued at around the €50m mark, though Hansi Flick is said to be loathe to lose the 22-year-old, who has been in and out of the team for much of the season, but finished the campaign in fine form, with three goals and an assist from midfield in the last four La Liga games.",

      "Manchester United are now thinking about where Kobbie Mainoo might go and what sort of fee they can get for him rather than whether they should sell him as Ruben Amorim doesn’t see a future for the midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "Mainoo burst onto the scene under Erik ten Hag last season, ending a stellar breakout season with a goal in the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City ahead of a key role for England at Euro 2024.",
      "But a combination of injury and poor form this term has led to increasing speculation over his future, with his 16 minutes across the two legs of the semi final and final of the Europa League providing pretty clear evidence of Amorim’s lack of faith in the 20-year-old.",
      "And with talks over a new contract but on hold indefinitely, Football Insider claim Amorim is now ‘prepared to see him leave over the off-season’ as he ‘does not see Mainoo fitting into his long- term plans’.",
      "Chelsea were interested in signing the previously ‘untouchable’ midfielder last summer and again in January, and will likely return to the table, though it’s been claimed that United – who reportedly want £70m for him – would rather not sell Mainoo to a direct rival.",
      "The report adds that ‘they then plan to reinvest the money into the first-team squad as they are determined not to weaken Amorim’s options ahead of the new season’.",
      "Former United scout Mick brown, who remains well-connected in the game, claims ‘the talk at the club is more about what sort of fee they could get for him and where he’s going to go’.",
      "“Man United are ready to let Kobbie Mainoo go,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“He’s been in and out of the team this season and didn’t sign the new contract they offered.",
      "“If it were up to me, they would be holding on to Mainoo at all costs.",
      "“I think he’s a top-class midfielder who could start for Man United and for England for the foreseeable future, and he’s come out of the academy.",
      "“But that’s not the way the club sees it and not the way Amorim sees it.",
      "“I don’t think Amorim sees him fitting in with his system and how he wants to play.",
      "“After missing out on the Champions League, they might have to sell.",
      "“The talk at the club is more about what sort of fee they could get for him and where he’s going to go.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims it’s all “gone quiet” over Mainoo’s future at United.",
      "He told GIVEMESPORT: ‘At the moment, no concrete talks taking place. The situation has gone quiet. Let’s see if bids come in this summer.’",

      "It remains to be seen whether the England international can find a place in Amorim’s formation and his pure profit sale would significantly boost United’s budget amid interest from Chelsea.",

      "",
      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nThere were still ‘best in the world’ shouts before the season started, but Martinez has emphatically proved otherwise.",
      "Six errors leading to a shot highlight the growing shakiness of the Argentina No.1, who more often than not cost his team rather than rescued them – though he still managed the latter a few times, admittedly.",
      "He’s nowhere near the world’s best now. His final-day c*ck-up played a bigger part than Villa’s disallowed goal and could well be his final act as an Aston Villa player. Quoting the Mailbox isn’t standard practice, but we’ll make an exception for this timeline: ‘1) Bring attention to yourself that want to leave the club, the game before last game where need a result, 2) Change your agent during the lead up to the big game, 3) Get yourself sent off during the big game’.",
      "",
      "RB: Rico Lewis (Manchester City)\nAlmost every Man City player has disappointed this season. Some did enough to haul them to third, but most went off the boil.",
      "Lewis looked destined for greatness, but this has been a tricky year. With the stars around him struggling, Lewis has looked more like a vulnerable kid than the composed upstart we saw last season. From looking alarmingly comfortable in midfield to being out of his depth, and from solid to defensively frail – next season’s huge. A loan feels beneath him.",
      "",
      "CB: Jean-Clair Todibo (West Ham)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe was willing to risk it all for this guy? For someone with such impeccable judgement, we are shocked that he wanted to spend a fortune on Todibo before UEFA slammed the door in his face.",
      "Manchester United’s loss was supposed to be West Ham’s gain, but the French centre-back had a poor season in a wildly underperforming team.",
      "Todibo played 27 league matches and his loan from Nice will become permanent in the summer for over £30million, for West Ham’s sins. Having officially splashed the cash, the Hammers will be desperate to see some improvement, especially when it comes to one-on-one defending as demonstrated at Ipswich on Sunday.",
      "",
      "CB: Radu Dragusin (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThere had to be some Spurs representation. They did finish 17th, after all. Bloody seventeenth. Still sounds ridiculous.",
      "Dragusin’s poor season has the caveat that he’s been out with an ACL injury since January, but before that, he was he all over the shop. He just seems to be a bad fit for Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs, but he came into the season off a really impressive Euro 2024 which adds to the disappointment.",
      "Being surpassed by Kevin Danso hasn’t helped – especially when the January signing is still no more than a back-up centre-back, but far more the right kind of back-up centre-back.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Igor Julio, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Lewis Dunk and Leny Yoro.",
      "",
      "LB: Leif Davis (Ipswich Town)\nThere were England call-up shouts for this guy when him and Ipswich were in the Championship. They’re going back down and we are not convinced Davis will be a transfer target for any Premier League club this summer.",
      "The Alfie Doughty comparisons were thrown around early, but Davis never came close. Just two assists – despite taking set-pieces all year – isn’t good enough. We expected more from him, and naively, Ipswich.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Ian Maatsen and Oleksandr Zinchenko.",
      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Ipswich Town)\nWe have no idea where poor Kalvin Phillips goes from here. Leeds United, probably. But will they even want their old fan favourite after a miserable campaign at another newly-promoted team? We’d be surprised, but there’s no future for him at Man City.",
      "The player who bossed games for Leeds and England looks long gone. Now 29, this summer is career-defining. He played just 30 minutes across Ipswich’s final nine league games.",
      "",
      "CM: Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nAfter a breakout season and a starring role at Euro 2024, Mainoo was meant to take the next step.",
      "United’s struggles aren’t on him, but we still expected more from someone who seemed ready to assume the role of a team leader. He’s not being written off – far from it – but that next step might not be in Manchester. Defeat in the Europa League final could force the club’s hand financially.",
      "Worryingly, he already looks a bit leggy. He’s dropped down Ruben Amorim’s pecking order, despite seemingly fitting the 3-4-3 like a glove.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Mats Wieffer, Carlos Soler, Guido Rodriguez, Edson Alvarez, Ilkay Gundogan and Lucas Paqueta.",
      "",
      "RW: Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nFrom Premier League Player of the Season to Phlop of the Season.",
      "Problems in his personal life have contributed to a bitterly disappointing year, but we all know there is a world-class player in there. Getting adequate rest to recover physically and mentally will go a long way to Foden coming Back Stronger in 2025/26.",
      "Foden only scored or assisted in six games all season, with a purple patch in January (six goals, one assist in four games) followed by a costly mistake against Arsenal and a complete fade-out. The 24-year-old didn’t score or assist from February onwards.",
      "",
      "AM: Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)\nThe Arsenal captain fell from the highest high from every attacking midfielder in the Premier League, but not necessarily to the lowest low. Christopher Nkunku, Fabio Carvalho, Joshua Zirkzee and Lucas Paqueta arguably reached deeper depths of despair.",
      "Odegaard has been the heartbeat of this Arsenal team since 2021/22 but his performances undoubtedly dipped this campaign. The ankle injury he suffered in September clearly hindered him for the rest of the campaign as his influence waned.",

      "ST: Rasmus Hojlund (Manchester United)\nA shaky debut season was to be expected, especially when there was an outstanding purple patch before an unfortunate injury. But showing no signs of improvement, only regression, has left the club’s supporters fearing they’ve signed a dud.",
      "He only scored four goals across the entire Premier League campaign. That’s the same number of goal involvements as Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson. Not only has Hojlund shown a lack of conviction in front of goal, but his overall play has been very poor.",
      "By almost every metric, he ranks near the bottom for Premier League strikers: take-ons, penalty-box touches, passes, aerials, shots, assists… the lot. Even his xG per 90 (0.33) is worrying for a main striker.",
      "Dishonourable mention: Evan Ferguson. It’s arguable that as a disappointment, Ferguson blows Hojlund out of the water. The latter being worse than last season was half-expected, but people were hyping Ferguson all the way to the moon.",
      "",
      "Manager: Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nSeven wins, six draws, 14 defeats. A 15th-place finish. Knocked out in the Carabao Cup quarters and FA Cup last 16, and defeated in the Europa League final. Miserable.",
      "Yes, it’s not his squad. Yes, it’s a ‘transition’. But come on. This is a team assembled for over £700m, with the second-highest wage bill in the league. They shouldn’t be this bad.",

      "The gap between the Premier League and Championship has become a gulf. The last six teams promoted into the Premier League have been relegated straight back out of it.",
      "All the while, 17 teams become richer, more deeply entrenched and ever harder to shift. Will next season really be hugely different?",
      "There’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, obviously, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is now an absolute chasm.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "You only need look at Spurs and United this season to see why and how.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just building your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "But if they are terrible, is it too much to ask that maybe that be accompanied by some actual consequences?"

      "Man Utd have agreed to Wolves' terms to pay Matheus Cunha's release clause of £62.5m in three parts over two years; United now have permission to start a medical and conclude the deal; First of two summer transfer windows opens on June 1",
      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 15:49, UK",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to undergo a medical at Manchester United after the terms of his £62.5m release clause at Wolves were met.",
      "Manchester United and Wolves had been in contact to discuss the payment structure. United had originally wanted to pay the figure over five years, but will now meet Wolves' terms of three parts over two years.",
      "Wolves have now given United permission to conclude the deal with 26-year-old Cunha and start a medical.",
      "Cunha believes United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and, regardless of interest from other clubs, the Brazil international wants to play for United.",
      "The forward has enjoyed a standout season at Wolves, scoring 17 goals and providing six assists across 34 appearances.",
      "\"What happened [on Tuesday] is that United contacted Wolves and said they would like to trigger the clause but would like to pay the £62.5m in five instalments.",
      "\"Wolves turned around and said you've got to read the contract, it's there in black and white - we signed a new contract with the player in January, these are the terms of the contract, if you want him, the £62.5m needs to be paid in three instalments over two years. United have gone back to Wolves and said they'll accept those terms.",
      "\"United don't want to waste any time, they are pushing ahead to sign him and Wolves have said fine that's all good, you've triggered the release clause, we will now give you permission to speak to the player and also for the player to have a medical.",
      "\"So if all goes well with the medical, Matheus Cunha will become a Manchester United player.",
      "\"A lot of people who don't support Manchester United are asking, 'Where's the money coming from? We thought United were in trouble financially, we thought they'd missed out on the Champions League, potentially £100m. How come straight away they can afford to sign Matheus Cunha?'",
      "\"The £62.5m is not being paid in one lump sum, like most transfers, it's being paid in instalments and it's going to be three instalments of £21m.",
      "\"For a club the size of Manchester United, you would have to say that is affordable. They have got financial fair play PSR concerns like all other clubs, players will be leaving Manchester United this summer as well but Cunha won't be the only signing.",
      "\"I think they will make other signings, but the signings really have to work because you speak to a lot of people in football and they will tell you Manchester United's recruitment has just not been good enough.\""

      "Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing and upsetting; Antony has been on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United since January; Brazilian winger faces Chelsea on Wednesday in the Conference League final;",
      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "The 55-year-old Dutchman has signed a contract running through to June 2027 with the German club.",
      "Ten Hag inherits a team that finished second behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga and reached the German Cup semi-finals after winning both competitions under Alonso the year before.",
      "Alonso left to take over as Real Madrid coach, replacing Carlo Ancelotti who has taken charge of the Brazil national team.",
      "It is Ten Hag's first job since he was dismissed as United coach in October 2024.",
      "He won two domestic cups in his two-and-a-half years in charge at Old Trafford but was fired after the club's worst start to a season, with four defeats in nine league games.",
      "Speaking in his first press conference after the appointment was announced, Ten Hag said: \"Bayer is one of the best clubs in Germany and also belongs to the expanded European elite.",
      "\"The club offers excellent conditions, and the discussions with the officials have impressed me greatly.",
      "\"I have come to Leverkusen to confirm the ambitions that have grown over the past few years. It is an appealing task to build something together in this phase of change and to develop an ambitious team.\"",
      "The club's sporting director Simon Rolfes praised the success and \"quality\" of Ten Hag after announcing the appointment following his experiences at both Ajax and United.",
      "Ten Hag spent four seasons at Ajax from 2018, winning the Eredivisie three times and the KNVB Cup twice, before taking on the role at Old Trafford in 2022 where he won the FA Cup and League Cup.",
      "\"With Erik ten Hag, we are relying on an experienced coach with impressive sports successes. His six title wins with Ajax Amsterdam were exceptional,\" said Rolfes.",
      "\"With three championships and two cup victories, he and Ajax dominated Dutch football unchallenged from 2018 to 2022. And even through the subsequent successes with Manchester United under sometimes difficult conditions, Erik has proven his quality as a coach.",
      "\"Our visions of football align. With technically demanding and dominant football, we want to pursue the highest goals in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and Champions League.\""
