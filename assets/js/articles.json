      "Manchester United transfer target Benjamin Sesko has earned comparisons to Erling Haaland and the 22-year-old hopes to become \"even better\" than the Manchester City star. Sesko is currently at the centre of a major transfer battle.",
      "Newcastle had an opening bid for Sesko rejected by RB Leipzig, but have since returned with an improved offer worth an initial £69.5million plus £8.6m in add-ons. The Red Devils, meanwhile, have also lodged a bid of £65.2m up front and £8.6m in add-ons.",
      "However, it is claimed that those in Manchester are confident that Sesko prefers a move to Old Trafford over a switch to Newcastle. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Sesko, but he is an exciting young prospect who has been compared to Haaland.",
      "Sesko did essentially replace Haaland at Red Bull Salzburg after he left the club for Borussia Dortmund and the Slovenia international has claimed that most of his team-mates believe that he is better.",
      "Addressing the comparisons, Sesko explained that his electric pace was the trait most similar to Haaland. \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy,\" he said.",
      "\"They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is. My teammates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko also regards Haaland as one of his idols, adding: \"He's an amazing player, I've big respect for him and I usually watch many YouTube videos about him. I'm very happy I received Haaland's jersey. I want [to] keep it for my jersey collection. He also said 'well played', I was very happy.\"",
      "The Red Devils do have a potential edge over Newcastle in the form of Christopher Vivell, who is currently working as their director of recruitment. Vivell has been credited for discovering Sesko when he was at Salzburg and spearheading their move for the striker.",
      "And Vivell has previously stated that Sesko is a \"special player\" who has \"enormous potential\". Speaking back in 2022, Vilvell said: \"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents and has enormous potential to become a top player.",
      "\"He has all the qualities to do that. He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air. Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6'4\") is mobile and technically strong. His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has introduced a new rule to training at Manchester United - the losers pick up ALL the equipment used that day.",
      "The Portuguese manager's debut campaign after taking over from Erik ten Hag last November proved to be a disaster. However, things have been looking up for him in pre-season, with United winning the Premier League Summer Series in the USA. They recorded victories over West Ham United and Bournemouth, while also drawing 2-2 with Everton.",
      "Amorim has been cutting no corners in his quest to transform United, who were so often criticised last season. One of his methods has been bringing a competitive edge to training drills, to introduce a more intense environment. And one key factor has been the use of forfeits for losing teams, which normally involves requiring them to pick up the equipment from the day's training.",
      "United young star Toby Collyer has commented specifically on the rule, telling The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Right-back Diogo Dalot also discussed how the standards in pre-season have been raised compared to last term. The Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",
      "It comes alongside Amorim's work to enhance his players' understanding of his preferred 3-4-3 formation. The United boss refused to budge from his favourite set-up last term, even when the team's form was at its lowest. And now he is doubling down.",
      "He sets out his defenders in his preferred back five, with substitute defenders standing behind his starters as he shifts them left and right by kicking the ball into a particular area of the pitch. It can be a time-consuming and laborious process, but Amorim is fully focused on the details.",
      "Another area of the pitch where United were regularly outclassed was in midfield. This season, Amorim believes his players will be able to dominate the middle of the park.",
      "When asked why he is feeling so confident, he said: \"I think it's the time to train. Even the certainty of the movements can help a player to be faster, if you are thinking, 'I jump, I don't jump.'",
      "\"We train when they need to jump; they already know. Sometimes it's one metre, one second. That is something that the tactical aspect and the physical aspect are together.\"",
      "United face an ominous start to the new Premier League campaign. On the first day of the season, they host title-chasing Arsenal at Old Trafford before a difficult trip to Fulham the following week.",
      "A home clash against newly promoted Burnley is swiftly followed by an away clash against Manchester City and then another home match against Chelsea. These games will be the biggest test of whether Amorim's methods have been absorbed by his players.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has said YES to joining Manchester United, putting them in pole position for his signature. Sesko, 22, has become the latest player to snub Newcastle, who made two bids for the RB Leipzig star.",
      "Newcastle's second offer, totalling £78million, was accepted by the German side earlier this week. But after a summer spent missing out on their top targets, the Magpies have suffered rejected once again.",
      "All parties are now aware of Sesko's preference to move to Old Trafford, as first reported by the Athletic. Ruben Amorim's side offered a total package of £73.8m, so they'll need to negotiate with Leipzig in order to reach a club-to-club agreement.",
      "Personal terms aren't expected to be an issue, as the Red Devils' pursuit of a striker nears a successful conclusion. Sesko - who Old Trafford chiefs have had on their radar since he was playing for Slovenian club Domzale aged 16 - was a target for Arsenal before the Gunners opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "In that case, it was Amorim who missed out, having coached the Swede at Sporting Lisbon. They then looked into signing Ollie Watkins, although Aston Villa were demanding £60m.",
      "At 29, the Red Devils didn't feel that he represented good value. England international Watkins could now be an option for Newcastle, who are preparing for life without Alexander Isak after he informed club officials that he wants to leave.",
      "Liverpool are preparing a second offer for Isak after their opening bid of £120m, inclusive of add-ons, was rejected last week. Like Sesko, Isak has been training alone amid the race to sign him.",
      "The Slovenian's move to Manchester could also signal the departure of Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for just £30m after two underwhelming seasons. Sesko would be part of a new-look forward line at Old Trafford including summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The pair were both linked with moves to Newcastle but chose to work with Amorim, despite the Magpies boasting Champions League football. Other targets who Newcastle missed out on include James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike and Joao Pedro.",

      "\"I feel that is the only way we are going to get where we want to go, which is to maximise quality over quantity. That is the way it has always been, the way we work, we try to improve, we have don it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It has been a challenging summer as you know. We have missed out on loads of different targets for different reasons. But we are still very competitive and we are still in there trying to bring good players to the club, that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "United's offer matches that of Newcastle, who are willing to pay Leipzig more of the fee up front. That could see Ruben Amorim's side miss out and go back to the negotiating table for Watkins, who was their initial priority.",
      "According to the Sun, the England international feels that the time is right to leave Villa Park after five seasons, having been the subject of a bid from Arsenal in January. Villa turned down their £60m offer before Watkins finished the campaign with 17 goals in all competitions.",
      "The report adds that given Villa's PSR concerns, a bid in the region of £40m to £50m could be enough to prise him away. That could tempt the Red Devils, who'd be able to use the money saved from buying Sesko on another problem area, defensive midfield.",
      "What's more, Villa have agreed a deal to sign a new striker. Evann Guessand is set to arrive from Nice for an initial £26m plus £4.3m in add-ons.",
      "Although United believe that they're Sesko's preferred destination after years of interest, Leipzig are said to be keen on doing business with Newcastle because of the structure of their offer, boosting Watkins' chances of getting his move to Old Trafford. The Slovenian is currently training away from Leipzig's first-team squad as the race to sign him hots up.",
      "Watkins isn't the only alternative for Amorim, though. Porto star Samu Aghehowa, who was previously a target for Newcastle and Villa, and Benfica's Vangelis Pavlidis are both on their shortlist, while it's claimed in Italy that Juventus have offered the Red Devils the chance to sign Dusan Vlahovic for a cut-price fee.",
      "There's also the option of keeping Rasmus Hojlund, who United would be willing to sell for £30m. Speaking after the Dane scored during their 4-1 win against Bournemouth in pre-season, Amorim hailed: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "\"The important thing is the strikers who are here are working hard they are improving and helping the team. That is the most important thing.",

I have criticised his behaviour in the past but he knows what it takes to win titles, he has that experience. He can inspire other players and he has all the qualities needed of a top goalkeeper.",

One fear I have is for Aston Villa, I am worried about them with top players leaving the club, I’m not sure where it will leave them next season.\"",

      "Hojlund has struggled for goals and is linked with a move away with the Bundesliga now a live option. Leverkusen, who have received plenty of cash this summer, could face competition from AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus according to Caught Offside.",

      "Omar Berrada has insisted major figures at the club are working hard to strengthen Amorim's squad this summer. Speaking to reporters at the weekend, the United CEO said: \"We have to do a lot of multi-tasking.",
      "\"We have a team back home led by (director of football) Jason (Wilcox), the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it. What we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.\"",

      "Barcelona face a race against time to sell players to make room for Marcus Rashford in their squad, it has been claimed. The Catalan club face a familiar problem as they aim to register the England international, who completed a loan move from Manchester United in July.",
      "Last summer, Hansi Flick's side found themselves in a similar situation with Dani Olmo. The issue concerns La Liga's wage cap, wit clubs required to trim their bill - ideally by offloading senior players - if they want to add any new arrivals to their squad.",
      "They were eventually able to register Olmo in time for the start of the 2024-25 season, before being forced to jump through hoops for a second time in January. This time around, Rashford isn't the only one facing the same situation.",
      "Barca completed a loan move for Rashford with an option to buy, and he - along with new keeper Joan Garcia - need to be accommodated. According to Sport (via Football Espana), the club will also need to re-register Wojciech Szczesny after the Polish international's contract expired and he signed fresh terms.",
      "The club are also looking to register youngsters Gerard Martin and Marc Bernal as first-teamers, as well as new signing Roony Bardghji. Swedish winger Bardghji joined from FC Copenhagen earlier in the summer, but will reportedly only be added to the first-team squad after the other five.",
      "Barcelona will get their campaign underway against Mallorca on August 16. They have previously expressed confidence over doing what they need to do to ensure Rashford can play a part, but they're not there yet.",
      "A number of players have already left this summer, including Pablo Torre - who could feature against them for Mallorca on the opening day. Clement Lenglet and Pau Victor are among the others to leave permanently, while Ansu Fati's loan to Monaco will see the Ligue 1 club cover a portion of the player's wages.",
      "The future of Marc Andre ter Stegen could remain a key factor when it comes to Barca registering new players. The German goalkeeper missed most of last season through injury, and Barca had looked to register Garcia as an injury replacement - thereby not having to find extra wage budget for him.",
      "Those short-term replacements account for players expected to miss four months or more, and Ter Stegen has publicly denied this to be the case. According to reports in Spain, the club have begun disciplinary proceedings against the former Borussia Monchengladbach stopper, who is still Barca's captain - though some board members are said to have questioned whether he should retain the armband.",
      "The injury clause allowed Barca to register Olmo last season. Danish defender Christensen missed the first half of the campaign with an achilles issue, but Olmo needed to be re-registered upon the centre-back's January return.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Simon Jordan has told Benjamin Sesko to head to St James' Park over Old Trafford, stating the RB Leipzig striker will have \"less scrutiny\" playing under Eddie Howe than Ruben Amorim. The former Crystal Palace chairman admits he had \"reservations in the past\" over the Newcastle manager, but he now believes the Carabao Cup winners are the right team for Sesko to thrive in.",
      "Newcastle and Manchester United are locked in a transfer battle to sign the 22-year-old. The two sides have submitted big bids to bring Sesko to their respective clubs.",
      "The Magpies struck first with a rejected offer before coming back with an improved proposal worth £70million plus add-ons. However, the Red Devils have lodged a bid of their own worth £65.1m plus a further £8.7m in add-ons, and a final decision from the Slovenian international looks to be imminent.",
      "Jordan appeared on talkSPORT to discuss the choice Sesko faces, admitting that if money weren't an issue, then Newcastle should be his prime destination.",
      "\"If I were in his shoes, if the economics of the deal were that I wasn't being compromised financially by going to Newcastle over Manchester United, I think it's a great move,\" Jordan said, before he went on to discuss the former Bournemouth boss.",
      "\"I think Eddie Howe is a brilliant manager – I had my reservations about him in the past – I've had conversations already. I like him very much, and I think he's done a brilliant job.",
      "\"So I would be looking at Newcastle rather than Man United.\"",
      "Jordan went on to note that everything Sesko does would be looked at under a microscope when playing under Amorim at United, whereas he would have more freedom to grow while developing under Howe. Jordan added: \"I think because Newcastle comes with expectation, but doesn't come with the same pressure that Man United comes from.",
      "\"Whilst people focus on Newcastle, they focus on it because Newcastle makes a lot of noise, because it's a very passionate football club and the fans are very motivated by it. It doesn't have the day-to-day scrutiny that Man United has.",
      "\"It doesn't matter what happens, you can fart in the corridor of Man United – that's heard around the world. It's not the same at Newcastle.\"",
      "United are reportedly confident that Sesko will be heading to the north west of England to add to their attacking line, having secured the signatures of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and ex-Wolves man Matheus Cunha already this summer.",
      "Sesko, though, is considered a ready replacement at Newcastle for Alexander Isak, whose form has understandably caught the attention of Premier League champions Liverpool. The Reds have already submitted a £110m bid for the Swede – which has been rejected – but Howe looks destined to sell the wantaway star should the Magpies first land Sesko.",
      "The Red Devils are in yet another period of transition. In November 2024, they appointed former Sporting CP boss Amorim to help the club compete back in the European places of the Premier League, but another disappointing campaign last season saw them ultimately finish in 15th and without a trophy.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are on the up after securing their first piece of silverware in 70 years in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. They finished fifth last year in the Premier League and are set to compete in the Champions League once again this season.",
      "Meanwhile, United will be without European football this campaign after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "All of these things may well factor into Sesko's decision to pick black and white or Manchester red, with both sets of fans eagerly awaiting to see his choice made soon.",

      "It has been a frustrating summer so far for Newcastle. Anthony Elanga their only senior outfield signing, joining in a £55m move from Nottingham Forest, while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has joined from Southampton.",
      "They have missed out on other targets, though, with French striker Hugo Ekitike opting for Liverpool and Joao Pedro choosing Chelsea. It's not just forwards who have looked elsewhere, either, with centre-back Dean Huijsen moving to Real Madrid and goalkeeper James Trafford deciding to rejoin Manchester City.",
      "One man who could yet move to St James' Park is Yoane Wissa. Eddie Howe's side have so far failed to meet Brentford's asking price for the Congolese international, who has now returned to training in West London, but there is still time left in the window.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" Newcastle manager Howe said over the weekend. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us. I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity.",
      "\"It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.\"",

      "Rio Ngumoha wasn't short of offers when deciding to sign for Liverpool, with Jurgen Klopp indirectly playing a key role in his arrival at Anfield. The 16-year-old signed for the Reds last summer after spending eight years in Chelsea's academy.",
      "Regarded as one of the Blues' most promising players, he was offered a scholarship by the Premier League side. But he opted to join Liverpool's academy, where he initially joined the club's Under-18s squad.",
      "Over a year since his signing, the teenager has emerged as one of the country's most highly-rated talents thanks to his exploits in pre-season this summer with the Premier League champions. With four goals and assists to his name in six games, he capped off the club's season preparations with a stunning solo goal in a 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao on Monday in front of fans at Anfield.",
      "Realising that Ngumoha's ceiling is otherworldly, Liverpool supporters would certainly gain extra satisfaction knowing he rejected Manchester United last summer thanks to the work the Reds had already done to secure his future.",
      "According to The Athletic, the winger had held talks with the Red Devils last June, who laid out their plans for him if he decided to leave Chelsea. While pushing for his signing, United chiefs conceded defeat, believing they were behind Liverpool in the chase for his signature.",
      "While it was Arne Slot at the helm when Ngumoha arrived, credit has been handed to Klopp over the role he may have played in the forward's decision to switch clubs.",
      "The German – who left the club last summer after announcing his decision to leave earlier that season – was known for his penchant for bringing through youngsters into the first-team at Liverpool. The Daily Mail reported that Ngumoha's decision to join Liverpool was motivated by Klopp's methods of integrating academy players into his squad.",
      "The Reds' Carabao Cup final victory over Chelsea last year was directly pointed to as an important factor, as Klopp fielded six Liverpool academy graduates at Wembley. While Caoimhin Kelleher and Conor Bradley started the game, Jayden Danns, Bobby Clark, James McConnell and Jarell Quansah all came on.",
      "Prior to his Liverpool move, Ngumoha had made just one appearance for Chelsea's U21 team and had yet to make his professional debut. He's since done exactly that with the Reds, where he started in their 4-0 win against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup earlier this year and has played a starring role in pre-season.",
      "The winger discussed his experience playing with the first-team this summer while opening up on the influence Mohamed Salah has had on himself and the rest of the young players at Liverpool. \"Training with the best team in the world; the players that you get to train with, you learn from them and you really test yourself against them,\" he said in his first Liverpoolfc.com interview this past week.",
      "\"It has been very good. Patience is key. I don’t want to rush anything. I’m young. Just keep working hard, pushing hard and just showing the manager what I can really do, and affect the team. They really help the young players – especially me, Trey [Nyoni].",
      "\"They help us really settle in. [Mohamed] Salah was one of my role models growing up obviously, so it’s really big [to be] learning from him. Everyone is really professional and you can see why they’re at the top. They’re always thinking about football, recovery, little things like eating right. So, [you] definitely can learn a lot from them.\"",

      "But latest reports suggest that the decision will ultimately come down to which club Sesko would rather turn out for this season - and Sesko is now expected to confirm his intentions by tonight.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday it emerged that United formally submitted a bid of £73.8m for the 22-year-old, speeding up the process that will see him leave the Bundesliga outfit. Newcastle were first to lodge a formal bid that was rejected. Following talks with the Bundesliga club, Eddie Howe's side submitted an improved offer of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "There are added considerations however that could also end up impacting Premier League champions Liverpool. Should Sesko decide to move to Old Trafford instead of St James' Park it would increase the chances of Alexander Isak remaining with the Toon despite expressing his desire to explore new opportunities amid interest from Anfield.",
      "Although the Toon’s asking price remains some way higher than what the Premier League champions appear willing to pay having last week had a first bid rejected.",

      "According to The Mail, Maguire is keen to sign an extension which would see him play out the remainder of his career with United. The club are said to be on the same page, though talks are yet to have begun.",
      "Amorim has included Maguire in a six-man leadership group, along with Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui and captain Bruno Fernandes. This makes an exit unlikely, despite five Premier League clubs looking to pounce.",
      "The interest in Maguire doesn't just come from England, either. According to the same Mail report, two unnamed Italian clubs have explored a move, along with three from the Premier League.",
      "There have also been suggestions of interest from Turkey and France. The five approaches from England and Italy have been knocked back, though, with no indication right now that an exit might follow.",

      "\"Right after the game, we won’t let you out of Old Trafford. Fiorentina can go with [Andre] Onana,\" one supporter wrote under De Gea's message.",
      "\"Welcome home Dave,\" wrote a second, with a third saying: \"We miss you\". \"Will be great seeing you play again. Terrible how our club treat you,\" was the verdict from a fourth.",
      "De Gea's former club are looking to round off an unbeaten pre-season campaign by getting the better of Fiorentina. After a goalless draw with Leeds in Stockholm, Ruben Amorim's team claimed two wins and a draw in the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "There was room for improvement in the last of those games, a 2-2 draw with Everton, which prompted captain Bruno Fernandes to ask questions. Ruben Amorim's side will now hope to go out with a bang before beginning their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17.",
      "United could find themselves without first-choice keeper Onana for the weekend friendly. The Cameroon international has been working his way back from injury and is optimistic about returning for the league opener, but the Fiorentina match-up may still come too early.",
      "\"l'm good, I feel great,\" Onana told NBC during United's spell in the US. \"It's been a few difficult weeks but yeah, hopefully, I will be back for the start of the season. I'm enjoying the training with my guys and we are looking forward.\"",
      "Reflecting on the tour, he added: \"We're happy with the way things are going. We play well, score goals and I'm happy how the team is developing themselves. Let's see. I think it's going to be important to have a good start against Arsenal and then everything is possible.\"",

      "As a result, the 1958 supporters' group are planning a protest ahead of United's first league game against Arsenal on August 17. The group believe that Ratcliffe is \"complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is\".",

      "\"Eventually, if it reached the extent that the Glazer family have been abused, then I'd have to say, 'look, that's enough guys, let somebody else do this'. They can't really come to a match, the Glazers. They've retreated into the shadows a bit now, so I'm getting all the bloody stick.",
      "\"We bought in and I haven't seen them since. It's 'Thank you, Jim, you're doing a really good job'. At the moment, I don't have to walk around like that. But it would defeat the object, wouldn't it? You couldn't tolerate it at that level, it just wouldn't be fun.\"",

      "The Red Devils are going head to head with Newcastle to snap up in the in-demand Slovenian international and have already lodged their first bid of around £73million, matching a similar offer from the Magpies.",
      "United's bid includes a package of £65.2m plus £8.6m in add-ons as they attempt to convince Sesko Old Trafford is the right place to continue developing his career, despite not having any European football to offer.",
      "Newcastle, meanwhile, can give Sesko the chance to play Champions League football this season - hoping he can replace Alexander Isak amid talks with Liverpool over a £150m deal.",
      "But United are hoping they have another ace up their sleeve in Vivell, who signed the forward for Leipzig in the first place.",
      "And before Leipzig, when Vivell was at Red Bull Salzburg, he reportedly discovered Sesko when he was a 16-year-old and signed him from Slovenian club Domzale. According to Bild, this could make Vivell United's secret weapon in negotiations.",
      "As someone he trusts, Sesko might prefer to join United having worked with Vivell in the past, even though he would likely be the main man at Newcastle.",
      "United have shown that they still have that 'big club pull' despite being out of Europe after signing Wolves star Matheus Cunha £62.5m and securing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo for £71m.",
      "Sesko now has a huge decision to make between United and Newcastle as he prepares to leave Leipzig after two seasons. He scored 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "The 22-year-old was left out of Leipzig's friendly clash against Atalanta this weekend amid ongoing speculation.",
      "He is United's number one striker target, but the club still have some alternatives if he does end up chosing Newcastle.",
      "United initially targeted Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins before being put off the club's £60m price tag for a player five years older. They have also been monitoring Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson but it is believed the Blues want at least £80m for the Senegalese star.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been told he could command a bigger salary than expected as Manchester United and Newcastle battle for his signature. Both Premier League teams have tabled bids for the RB Leipzig striker as they look to secure their top summer target.",
      "Newcastle were first to make a formal offer for the 22-year-old that was rejected by the Bundesliga club. The Magpies then returned with an improved bid of £69.5m plus £8.6m in add-ons on Monday.",
      "The Red Devils then made their move on Tuesday with a proposed deal worth £65.2m plus £8.6m in further payments. Sesko, who netted 21 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions last season, is believed to be training separately from the Leipzig squad as the race to sign him heats up.",
      "The Slovenian international has now been advised by former United and Wrexham goalkeeper Ben Foster to turn the situation to his advantage by using it to leverage more money in wages. The 42-year-old also urged him to choose a switch to Old Trafford rather than take on the burden of potentially having to replace Alexander Isak's impressive goal haul at Newcastle.",
      "\"If he goes to Newcastle, the Champions League is a massive draw, but he's got some big boots to fill there with Isak,\" said Foster on his Fozcast podcast. \" As a striker, I don't know if you necessarily need that kind of excess pressure as well.",
      "\"Whereas at United, he hasn't got it so much. They're not the Man United of old but in stature, it's still Manchester United. You're going to get the same wages no matter where you go. The fact that you've got two [clubs interested] means you might just be able to bump it up by an extra £50,000 a week.\"",
      "Newcastle have opted to chase Sesko after Isak, who scored 23 goals across all competitions last season, told the club he wants to leave St James' Park following interest from Liverpool. The reigning Premier League champions had an initial offer for Isak rejected last week, but are expected to return with a second bid.",
      "By comparison, United are looking to improve on Rasmus Hojlund, who boasted a less impressive tally of 10 goals last term. The Red Devils have already bolstered their forward line this summer by signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined sum of £133.5m.",
      "According to a report by the Athletic, United are eyeing other options in case they lose out to Newcastle. Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is one target who is understood to be on their radar and could be allowed to leave Stamford Bridge this summer subject to a reasonable offer.",
      "Meanwhile, French outlet L'Equipe claims that Paris Saint-Germain's Randal Kolo Muani is another possibility United are considering. Juventus were the original favourites for Muani, but the deal is said to have hit a stumbling block.",
      "Sesko was left out of Leipzig's squad for their pre-season game against Atalanta on Saturday. When asked for the reason for his exclusion, head coach Marcel Schafer said it was \"obvious.\"",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that, but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",

      "Pre-season is all about experimenting and Ruben Amorim did plenty of that during Manchester United's tour of the United States.",
      "United brought a successful tour to a close with a 2-2 draw against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday night, ensuring they won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United's tour of the US consisted of three games, two wins, one draw and eight goals. Their performances in the wins over West Ham United and Bournemouth were particularly impressive.",
      "With just one friendly to go - a clash with Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime - head coach Ruben Amorim will potentially use his side's final warm up match to get a good look at the starting XI he plans to unleash for the season opener against Arsenal in just under a fortnight's time.",
      "Over the course of United's opening four pre-season friendlies, the first of which was a goalless draw against Leeds United in Stockholm last month, Amorim made 18 changes to his starting XI, ensuring he got the opportunity to get as close a look as possible at the members of his squad.",
      "However, Amorim has not tested the water with many midfield combinations this summer, starting just two different central-midfield partnerships. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro started side by side against Leeds and Bournemouth, while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte got the nod against West Ham and Everton.",
      "Against the Hammers, Mainoo and Ugarte were excellent, producing performances that would not have looked out of place in a competitive fixture. United set an excellent tempo and the pair of them were drivers of it.",
      "Against Everton, though, United were sloppy in the engine room. They struggled against the Toffees' physicality levels and Ugarte was guilty of giving the ball away far too cheaply for Iliman Ndiaye's first half equaliser.",
      "Concerns about Ugarte's ability on the ball have regularly been expressed in recent months amid United's desire to sign a new midfielder this summer. As solid as he is defensively, his ability on the ball holds him back.",
      "Mainoo, whose long-term position under Amorim remains undecided, has looked at home as a No.8 for the majority of pre-season, playing forward-thinking passes and offering United a degree of energy.",
      "However, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha mean they are leading candidates to start the season as the two No.10s, meaning Fernandes, despite starting two games as one of the playmakers, is expected to make a permanent switch to midfield.",
      "If that expectation transpires, it is currently a wide open race to partner him in the engine room. Casemiro has been his midfield partner in the two games he has started deeper this summer, but the Brazilian is not guaranteed to remain a regular starter once the competitive action kicks off.",
      "Many United supporters believe Mainoo should, one way or another, be in Amorim's first-choice starting XI, ensuring the Portuguese head coach finds a way to make full use of his talent. However, the fact he and Fernandes have not played alongside each other in midfield at any point so far this pre-season suggests Amorim is not thinking about unleashing them as a midfield duo.",
      "Amid the debate that is going on about who will form United's strongest midfield partnership this season, concerns have understandably been raised about how little bite and defensive nous a duo of Mainoo and Fernandes would have.",
      "Both players are renowned for being forward-thinking, and Fernandes will be expected to take up attacking positions, leaving Mainoo potentially exposed.",
      "United need to source a new midfielder ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1, and they are expected to do so amid the likelihood of Toby Collyer being allowed to leave on loan.",
      "In an ideal world, United need a midfielder who is aggressive, good on the ball and defensively sound. However, ticking all of those boxes will come at a price.",
      "But having refused to unleash Fernandes and Mainoo as a paring so far this pre-season, it feels somewhat unlikely Amorim will turn to them come the start of the competitive action.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is not a striker, yet the club turned to the Dutchman in their search for goals. Needless to say, the gamble did not pay off.",
      "Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund scored just seven league goals between them last season, with United finishing the Premier League campaign on a -10 goal difference.",
      "United's pursuit of a new No.9 this summer hasn't exactly gone to plan, with Liam Delap snubbing them for Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres making the move to Arsenal and Aston Villa digging their heels in over Ollie Watkins. Benjamin Sesko is the new priority target, yet with Newcastle also keen to secure his signature, bringing him to Old Trafford is not going to be easy.",
      "Contingency plans are needed, and they will no doubt be in place, but is it really possible United could go another summer without signing an out-and-out centre forward?",
      "United's desire to sign a new striker is clear, but if they can't get a deal over the line then they will be forced to make do with their existing options.",
      "Matheus Cunha was trialled as a false nine against Everton on Sunday, and the £62.5million signing connected well in the move that led to United winning a first-half penalty. However, the former Wolves man was clearly eager to drop deep and get involved in play, leaving United without a focal point.",
      "The experiment didn't work and only further highlighted United's desperate need for a centre forward.",
      "United have been keen to avoid paying over £60m for players, but it's a transfer rule that has been scrapped this summer as they aim to bounce back from their worst domestic campaign in 51 years.",
      "Had the Cunha experiment worked, would they have been tempted to suggest not signing a striker wouldn't be the end of the world given the existing options available to them? It's impossible to say, and there's no indication to suggest they would have done. But as good a player as Cunha is, he will never be the answer to their problems up top.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side rounded off their tour of the United States on Sunday night by being crowned champions of the Premier League Summer Series. United drew 2-2 against Everton to make it two wins and one draw during the tour.",
      "The squad will now fly back to England and return to Carrington. There is now less than two weeks until the new Premier League season gets underway against Arsenal.",
      "The summer transfer window is still open, with United continuing to be linked with several potential new signings. A new striker is the priority for Amorim, with Benjamin Sesko at the top of their list.",
      "Newcastle are battling hard for the RB Leipzig striker's signature, but it has been suggested that United are the current favourites. There are also reports linking United with moves for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Paris Saint-Germain star Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "United have until September 1 to complete their transfer business, and there is likely to be plenty more twists and turns before the window closes next month.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below.",
      "Newcastle have offered a higher package to the Bundesliga outfit, but Sesko's preference is set to be decisive. The Magpies are set to play in the Champions League this season, but there is confidence that the 22-year-old wants to sign for United, who have a longstanding interest in the centre-forward.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Al Nassr have recently contacted Marseille to enquire about the availability of Mason Greenwood. The 23-year-old forward left United to join the French giants last summer in a deal worth £26.6m.",
      "The report claims that Marseille don't want to sell Greenwood, who has four years left on his contract, despite having recently re-signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on a free transfer. However, it's said that an offer in excess of £85m would get the Ligue 1 outfit to engage in talks.",
      "talkSPORT adds that United retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause for Greenwood.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport, Juventus has reached a preliminary agreement with Morten Hjulmand ahead of a potential transfer from Sporting this summer.",
      "The report claims that the Old Lady are yet to agree on a fee with Ruben Amorim's former side after having their opening bid turned down. It's said that Juventus proposed a player-plus-cash swap deal involving Douglas Luiz.",
      "Corriere dello Sport reckons that the Italian giants are unwilling to pay Hjulmand's release clause. Instead, Juventus are reportedly working to agree a deal in the region of £30m...",
      "According to The Athletic, United are closing in on a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. The report claims that the Bundesliga outfit has accepted a €82.5m (£71.8m) bid, plus €2.5m (£2.2m) in add-ons, from Newcastle, but the 22-year-old striker wants to join the Reds.",
      "It's said that United are yet to agree a fee with Leipzig, but talks are advancing towards a conclusion. Sesko was previously linked with a move to Arsenal before Mikel Arteta got his hands on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United officials believe that Benjamin Sesko wants to join the club. The report claims that the Reds have forwarded an official contract proposal to the Slovenian while they negotiate a fee with RB Leipzig.",
      "It's said that Newcastle's bid is currently €5m (£4.3m) more than United's. The 22-year-old striker, whose contract at the Red Bull Arena expires in June 2029, trained individually on Tuesday.",
      "Senne Lammens recently provided an update on his future at Royal Antwerp. The 23-year-old goalkeeper has been linked with a move to Old Trafford this summer following his impressive performances in the Belgian top-flight.",
      "\"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" Lammens told Gazet van Antwerpen. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here. In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground.",
      "\"When teams like that come along, I think you've earned it,\" added Lammens. \"I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place.",

      "Manchester United could be set for a dream final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "United badly needed to fix their goal-scoring issues after netting an abysmal 44 goals in the Premier League last term. Chances were regularly squandered by United's attacking players, who all lacked the composure needed to convert goal-scoring opportunities.",
      "Those problems have been identified and seem to have been partly addressed with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Wolves' Matheus Cunha. And yet a truly top squad needs a reliable goal-scoring No.9, and that's why they are chasing a deal for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",

      "United are understood to have submitted an opening offer for the striker worth just under £74million. It is a significant fee for a player that has never scored more than 15 goals in a single season in one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Amorim's recent comments suggest that United have completed thorough checks on Sesko's character before accelerating their interest. It comes after previous claims that the Reds have faced attitude problems, fallouts and dressing room leaks with their squad.",

      "\"It's not just how they play. It's really important how they play, of course, because that is their job, but their character is really important.",

      "But after a challenging 2022/2023 season marked by several high-profile blunders, the United favourite left - with then-head coach Erik ten Hag opting to bring in Andre Onana from Inter Milan as his successor. The goalkeeper endured a tough period post-United, struggling to secure a new club until he signed up with Italian Serie A side Fiorentina last summer.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly made their move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "And it's clear why so much money is being talked about for such an unproven talent, when you consider just how many attributes he has to succeed in the Premier League. Sesko's pace, power and height are gold dust for English clubs in a market where No.9s who fit that description are, seemingly, so rare.",

      "According to Calciomercato, United have been offered the opportunity to sign Juventus centre-forward Vlahovic this summer.",
      "The 25-year-old bagged 15 goals in all competitions last season including four in nine Champions League appearances.",

      "Marcus Rashford scored his first goal for Barcelona during their pre-season friendly against Daegu FC on Monday.",
      "The Manchester United forward's loan move to Camp Nou will see the reigning La Liga champions foot the bill for Rashford's wages during his stint at Camp Nou - a move that is expected to save United around £12million. Barcelona also have the option to make his transfer to Catalonia permanent for a fee of £26m.",
      "United delayed Rashford's return to Carrington for pre-season training last month as they stripped him of his iconic No.10 shirt. However, he has now realised his dream move to Barcelona - after spending the latter part of the 2024/2025 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Read more here",
      "Juventus are desperate to part ways with Vlahovic this summer and Tuttosport understands that the concept of reaching a mutual termination of his contract could be considered.",
      "This is because Juve are desperate not to continue paying his £20.8m annual salary as they watch their money.",
      "Should he be released from his contract, United may see Vlahovic as a good alternative to Sesko.",
      "If it is true that Sesko has agreed personal terms with both United and Newcastle, the lower bid from the Reds for the Slovenian could cost them.",
      "Ultimately, neither United nor Newcastle are direct rivals for RB Leipzig this summer and therefore the Bundesliga club will have no preference where he moves.",
      "Their only preference will be to make as much money as possible and thus, Leipzig will be leaning towards Newcastle if they are offering them the most money.",
      "Last month, reports emerged suggesting that Amorim was keen to reunite with Hjulmand this summer to bolster the central midfield.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, United could have an opening there as Juventus, who have been keen on the Dane, are now exploring other options.",
      "Among those being considered are believed to be former United loanee Sofyan Amrabat, Brighton’s Matt O’Riley and Spurs star Yves Bissouma.",
      "If a bid for Sesko has been made, this is great news for United.",
      "It is believed that United were only going to bid for the forward if they felt that Sesko favoured them.",
      "Now news that an offer has been launched is circulating, it suggests that the Slovenian may have made his mind up.",
      "United's bid is believed to be valued at just under £74m.",
      "Currently, it is not known which way Sesko will choose this summer.",
      "According to journalist Florian Plettenberg, Sesko has reached full verbal agreements with United and Newcastle over contracts.",
      "Final details with both clubs were agreed last night according to the Sky Sport Deutschland journalist.",
      "Plettenberg believes it is now down to which club can reach an agreement with Sesko first.",
      "This afternoon, RB Leipzig have provided an update on their squad.",
      "In that, they confirmed that striker Sesko has been training with the club but individually away from the rest of his teammates.",
      "The update comes amid reports that United have launched a bid for Sesko.",
      "Bookmakers Betfair have confirmed they have suspended betting on Sesko's move to United this summer with the Reds now seen as overwhelming favourites to sign him.",
      "Betfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom explained:",
      "Having been odds-on 8/15 favourites to sign Benjamin Sesko on Monday, betting is now suspended for Man United to seal a deal for the 22-year-old Slovenian. United have already secured deals for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to boost their attacking ranks this summer. With his future looking unlikely, Rasmus Hojlund is 3/10 to join RB Leipzig, heading in the opposite direction to Sesko.",
      "According to BILD, United are making their move for Sesko.",
      "It is understood that the Reds have launched their first formal bid for the Slovenian.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein understands the bid is valued at £65m plus £8.7m in add-ons.",
      "United are far from done this summer. We know they want a new centre-forward, with Benjamin Sesko of interest, but what other deals could they complete before the window closes?",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is a prime candidate for an exit and bookmakers Bet365 rate him as a 9/4 chance to stay at the Reds this summer with Chelsea the 4/11 favourites to sign the Argentina international.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are the 1/2 odds-on favourites to sign Sesko with United still a short 6/4 to complete his signature.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's situation is an interesting one. He could be allowed to leave Chelsea this summer and United are 9/4 to sign him. If United do not sign either Sesko or Jackson this summer, Ollie Watkins is an option and he's 4/1 to sign from Aston Villa.",
      "Other strikers the Reds could sign include free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin (5/1), and Christopher Nkunku (8/1).",
      "Elsewhere, Bet365 are offering odds on goalkeepers Emiliano Martinez (7/4) and Gianluigi Donnarumma (7/2) to sign for United.",
      "18+ only. Please gamble responsibly. Begambleaware.org.",
      "It is claimed they are now offering Leipzig £69.7m plus add-ons to bring the forward to St James' Park.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until 4pm with all the latest United news.",
      "We are going to kick things off by looking at this man and the latest on his future...",
      "According to The Athletic, Chelsea are in informal talks with United over Alejandro Garnacho. The 21-year-old winger has faced an uncertain future at Old Trafford for a while now after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report also claims that Real Betis want to sign Antony on a permanent basis after his successful loan spell in La Liga last season, but talks haven't entered the 'advanced' stages yet. It's said that United hope to offload Jadon Sancho and they're open to offers for Tyrell Malacia.",
      "The report claims United want a 'clear indication' that Sesko wants to join before submitting a formal bid. It's said that Ruben Amorim's side have already explored the conditions for other strikers, including Ollie Watkins."

      "Although the whole narrative of the fixture will centre around the Spaniard and his homecoming, head coach Ruben Amorim will be focused on ensuring his side finishes pre-season with a positive result and another positive performance.",
      "United have won two and drawn two of their opening four friendlies this summer, scoring eight goals and conceding four. On the whole, it has been a positive summer.",
      "However, pre-season results and performances will count for nothing if United make a slow start to the competitive action. They won just two of their opening seven Premier League matches last term, losing three.",
      "Two of those three losses were 3-0 home defeats at the hands of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. They marked the first of five Premier League home games in which United conceded three goals last season.",
      "United's Old Trafford record in the Premier League last season was terrible. They lost nine of their 19 home games, winning just seven.",
      "They also sieved 28 goals on their own patch in the league alone. Across all competitions, they conceded 43 times at Old Trafford.",
      "In addition to losing 3-0 to Liverpool and Spurs, Bournemouth, Forest and Brighton also scored three goals at Old Trafford last term. As a result, United won just 24 points on their own patch, meaning they had the 14th-worst home record in the Premier League.",
      "For a club of United's stature, that is simply unacceptable. They won just four games and 14 points at home following Amorim's appointment in November.",
      "The backbone to any successful team, more often than not, is turning their home stadium into a fortress. United proved that themselves in former manager Erik ten Hag's first season at the club in 2022/23.",
      "His first season in charge saw United turn Old Trafford back into the fortress it once was, winning 15 of their 19 home league games to collect 48 points. Only Manchester City, who won the title that season, earned more (52).",
      "Across all competitions, Ten Hag lost just two of his first 33 home games in charge of United and he regularly banked praise for the way in which his team made full use of home advantage. Amorim needs to try and hope he can boast a similar M16 record this coming season.",
      "Securing a record like that, though, is an easier said than done task. United need to earn the right to turn Old Trafford back into a fortress.",
      "They were often slow and uninspiring on home soil last season, allowing visitors to get on the front foot and seize control, highlighted by the fact they conceded the first goal in 12 of their 19 home league games. That is a problem in itself that needs ironing out.",
      "Old Trafford was once the most intimidating away ground in the Premier League, but most clubs rocked up last season confident of leaving with all three points in the bag.",
      "Amorim must change that by turning his side's home form around, but he will only be able to do much once his players cross the white line. Nevertheless, as a collective, United need to ensure Old Trafford is not considered as a playground for their opponents again.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has sent Manchester United a cryptic message on social media. The 21-year-old winger has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford for a while now, having fallen out of favour with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The cracks first started to show when the United boss left Garnacho at home for the Manchester derby in December due to concerns with his attitude. The Argentina international appeared to have learned his lesson, earning himself a place in Amorim's side.",
      "Then, on the final day of the season, the Portuguese tactician raised eyebrows when he omitted Garnacho from the matchday squad. The youngster was also benched for the Europa League final, despite having started each of the previous knockout round ties.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Garnacho, among others, has been excluded from the pre-season tour and he's been training separately from the core first-team squad. It's understood that Chelsea are interested in signing the winger, who has three years left on his contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Earlier this month, Amorim provided an update on Garnacho. The United boss described the Blues target as a 'talented boy', who wants 'a different thing with a different leadership'.",
      "\"I think Garnacho, you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy,\" said the 40-year-old. \"And sometimes things don't work out. You cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Garnacho appears to have responded to Amorim's comments with a rather cryptic message on social media. The Chelsea target posted a picture of himself holding his shirt to his Instagram story.",
      "It's not the first time that Garnacho's social media activity has caused a stir. During Erik ten Hag's spell in charge, the Argentine liked a post from a fan criticising the Dutchman's management.",
      "Fortunately for Garnacho, Ten Hag accepted his apology. A few months later, however, the winger was back in the spotlight after he liked another post criticising his head coach, this time from Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "Manchester United have been down this road before.",
      "After signing Rasmus Hojlund from Atlanta in the 2023 summer transfer window, United are now trying to sign another young striker in the form of RB Leipzig ace Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United are understood to have submitted an opening offer for the striker worth just under £74million. It is a significant fee for a player that has never scored more than 15 goals in a single season in one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "The Slovenian international scored 13 Bundesliga goals for Leipzig last season and 14 the season before. It is a respectable return for a player that only turned 22 at the very end of May, but is it good enough to command such an eye-watering price tag?",
      "Newcastle United have, of course, also expressed plenty of interest in the former Red Bull Salzburg striker, making two bids for his services thus far. Their second offer is reportedly worth more than United's opening bid.",
      "Attracting such interest from two Premier League clubs suggests both United and Newcastle are firmly of the belief Sesko is a striker that has the capability to come to England and make all the difference.",
      "The Reds, after finishing last season with a goal difference of -10, have prioritised attacking signings this summer, already bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. However, the missing piece in the jigsaw remains a No.9.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have signed two players with proven Premier League records. They scored 35 league goals between them last term and have plundered 71 career goals in England's top flight.",
      "As a result of their additions to Ruben Amorim's squad, United are within their rights to believe they can take a gamble on Sesko and deploy him at the tip of what would be a new-look attack. The Slovenian would be able to lean on them for support to help ease the burden on his shoulders.",
      "United have also expressed interest in Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins recently. He boasts a proven Premier League record and has plundered 35 goals league since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Watkins would offer a greater guarantee of hitting the ground running at Old Trafford and providing immediate results in front of goal. He knows the league inside out and has a very respectable record.",
      "On the flip side, Sesko has a higher ceiling than the England international, and potential is what United would be buying. Only turning 22 just over two months ago, he is still raw and developing.",
      "However, United, ahead of the start of this season, want to try and implement a long-term strategy under Amorim that can lead them to a position from which they will be able to launch a genuine title charge for the 2027/28 season. 'Project 150' was unveiled last year and it is has been created with the ambition of United winning the Premier League title in 2028 to coincide with their 150th anniversary.",
      "United's aim for the coming season, first and foremost, has to be securing a place back in Europe for the 2026/27 campaign. The Reds will be without European football this season for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "Although United will have fight from a low base to secure their place back in Europe for next season, they will be confident of doing so with the new signings they have made so far. Furthermore, a full pre-season for Amorim already appears to be paying off.",
      "Signing Sesko as a long-term option is something United can, to a degree, get away with this summer amid their additions of proven Premier League operators in Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The club, in the last 12 months or so, has shown through their recruitment they are prepared to sign young players with a long-term plan in mind.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article, and signing him would represent another massive risk in the attacking department, but there is no doubt about his potential, meaning he could prove to be a shrewd addition in the long-term.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Manchester United supporters group The 1958 have announced plans to stage a protest against the Glazer family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe ahead of the club's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford later this month.",
      "United will welcome the Gunners to M16 for their season curtain-raiser on Sunday, August 17.",
      "The 1958, who have organised numerous demonstrations and protests against United's ownership down the years, will march to Old Trafford with new banners being produced reading 'Jim Can't Fix This'.",
      "Ratcliffe secured a minority stake in United last year and the club has since been forced to navigate choppy waters since.",
      "The workforce has been slashed and numerous other unpopular decisions have been made across the board.",
      "A spokesman for The 1958 said: \"It's a new season but the same old ownership issues. Twenty years of the Glazers and their debt mountain is 20 years too long. Enough is enough.",
      "\"We won't allow some natural optimism and a couple of shiny new signings to deflect from the bigger off-field picture. Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and in our opinion is helping keep them in charge.",
      "\"So on 17th August, we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against Jim Ratcliffe – a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",
      "\"This is no longer just about ownership; this is about survival – the survival of our identity, our community, and our values.\"",
      "The spokesman added the protest is for \"every fan who has been silenced, evicted, priced out and disregarded\", adding \"this is about the future of football\".",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe, you have chosen your side and it is not ours,\" The 1958 member continued. \"You now stand shoulder to shoulder with the Glazers.",
      "\"The mask has slipped. You are no saviour. You’re like a (red) devil in disguise.\"",
      "The 1958 group staged a protest ahead of last season's game against Arsenal at Old Trafford, urging supporters to wear black to symbolise how the club is \"slowly dying\".",

      "Manchester United will have a new transfer priority if a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko is completed.",
      "Signing the Slovenian striker will eat up a large chunk of available funds for Ruben Amorim, and United will need to be mindful of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). So far this summer, the Reds have only managed to offload Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "The Catalan club are paying 100 per cent of Rashford's wages during his 12-month loan spell and have the option to sign him on a permanent deal. The deal is thought to save United around £12million and that will no doubt play a role in their ability to afford a move for Sesko.",
      "But where would the arrival of RB Leipzig's star forward leave the struggling Rasmus Hojlund? United's Danish striker has looked completely out of his depth across much of the past few seasons since joining from Atalanta in August 2023.",
      "Tuesday marks the two-year anniversary since his signing at M16 was announced. Much has changed since then for both club and player - with both seemingly at odds with what they now want.",
      "The player himself meanwhile appears less keen to leave. Hojlund insisted during United's recent pre-season tour that he intends to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Elsewhere, Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move away. The MEN reported earlier this summer that Amorim had told the 21-year-old he could leave the club.",
      "It follows Garnacho's complaint about not getting enough playing time in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli and English top-flight rivals Chelsea have shown the most interest as he continues to train away from the senior squad. However, neither club has made a move so far.",
      "If United can sell both players, then the Reds could receive a much-needed £60m cash boost after potentially spending over £70m on Sesko. Signing a new midfielder should then be where United turn to although time is running out before the summer window closes on September 1.",

      "Old Trafford or St James' Park? That is the question facing Benjamin Sesko right now.",
      "With just under four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, the RB Leipzig striker finds himself at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war between Manchester United and Newcastle United.",
      "Both clubs are determined to strengthen their respective forward lines ahead of the September 1 deadline and Sesko has emerged as a leading target for the pair of them.",
      "After finishing last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer.",
      "They have brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, but they are still missing the most importance piece of the jigsaw in the form of a recognised centre-forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who United are open to selling for £30million, regressed last season, scoring just ten goals in all competitions. Fellow attacker Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Bologna last summer, scored seven goals and is not a centre-forward.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap in early-June, United have since been chasing shadows in their striker search. However, it was never unrealistic to suggest sourcing their most important signing could take the most amount of time.",
      "Right now, Sesko occupies top spot on United's wish list. However, unlike Newcastle, they are yet to table a formal offer for the Slovenian international, who scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United do not want to get drawn into a bidding war for the striker, and understandably so, and it is believed they want assurances from Sesko that he wants to move to Old Trafford before potentially making an opening offer.",
      "Despite already spending more than £130m this summer, United are confident of financing a deal for Sesko before overseeing sales. United expect to save £14m this season on Marcus Rashford's wages, they have banked £5m from Chelsea's decision not to sign Jadon Sancho permanently and have raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses inserted in previous sales.",
      "In a better financial position than what was originally anticipated at the start of the window, United have resources available to them to sign Sesko. But is he worth the fee Leipzig are demanding?",
      "As with any transfer pursuit, United's interest in Sesko has split opinion. Many recognise his high ceiling and potential, and also acknowledge his respectable goalscoring record in Germany and Austria, but can United afford to take such a big risk at this moment in time?",
      "On one hand, supporters are within their rights to say yes, acknowledging the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, of which 35 were scored in the Premier League. On the flip side, others believe United should go for somebody who is more established and proven, no doubt mindful of the gamble United took on Hojlund two years ago.",
      "Last week, it was confirmed Ollie Watkins had also made his way onto United's list of options, but Aston Villa are currently refusing to sell him. He has three years left on his contract and scored 16 Premier League goals last season.",
      "However, if United are capable of throwing big-money at Leipzig in an attempt to sign Sesko, they will almost certainly have the funds available to try and change Villa's stance.",
      "Watkins is seven years Sesko's senior, meaning his ceiling is not as high, but what he does boast is a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League campaign, the England international has reached double figures in each of the last five seasons since joining Villa in 2020, scoring 75 league goals. He has plundered 87 goals in all competitions for Villa.",
      "At 29, Watkins is not necessarily as attractive a signing as what Sesko would be, but there is a stronger likelihood of him coming in and hitting the ground running. He has scored 35 Premier League goals in the last two seasons, assisting 21.",
      "Having already swooped for two of the Premier League's best players in Mbeumo and Cunha this summer, Watkins would be a fitting addition to come in and spearhead United's attack.",
      "Sesko currently sits at the top of the wish list, but it would be foolish to turn a blind eye to Watkins and his record.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Three games, two wins, one draw, eight goals and one trophy marked a positive pre-season tour for Manchester United as they won the Premier League Summer Series in the United States.",
      "Beyond the results and performances, United have looked fitter than at this stage in recent years, the manager is secure and no clouds are hovering over the squad.",
      "United's schedule was more streamlined and Chicago was a perfect base. The Endeavor Health Performance Center they trained at only opened this year and the players could socialise in a superb city with next-to-no hassle.",
      "The past fortnight has provided a promising platform for a successful season. With the transfer window open for four more weeks, United are certain to be active with incomings and outgoings and there are unaddressed issues that were apparent before they took off for Chicago.",
      "Here are five talking points from their tour:",
      "Bruno Fernandes, typically, was one of three players to start all three tour games and scored three goals. Fernandes ended the match against Everton in midfield, where he started against Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "Fernandes will flitter between the No.10 and the No.8 over the course of the season as United have a surfeit of options to play behind the striker. Even when Matheus Cunha operated as the false nine against Everton, Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Mason Mount had stints as one of the 10s.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is another option as Amorim ponders how to enhance a midfield arguably as in urgent need of an upgrade as up front. Whenever Fernandes eventually departs United, they are not going to require a playmaker for a while.",
      "United's intention to loan out Toby Collyer all but confirms a midfield recruit is lined up. Amorim criticised the \"lack of pace\" in the area after the goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm and he hooked Mainoo before the hour mark against Everton.",
      "The bigger issue in the 2-2 draw was Manuel Ugarte, who was stuck against the Toffees. Everton preyed on Ugarte's limitations and he wilted against an aggressive press. Ugarte sought protection from the referee and when he attempted to match Everton's physicality he committed an obvious foul.",
      "Casemiro is undeniably a squad player and not even in the new six-man leadership group, having been a part of it under Erik ten Hag. Collyer's three career starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One. Amorim has belief in Mainoo but seems caught between two stools as to his role.",
      "Amorim suggested he was \"happy\" that United underperformed against Everton, easily the least accomplished of their performances, as the players would not be lulled into a false sense of security back at Carrington. This has been a buoyant United tour but the midfield has to be improved.",
      "United's second-best player last season was another playmaker and Amad started behind Rasmus Hojlund in Chicago. In the other two games, he was on the right wing and that appears to be the role Amorim has settled on for him.",
      "Amorim had Geovany Quenda to service Viktor Gyokeres in his final months at Sporting and Amad is a similar profile: a young left-footed winger expected to assume defensive responsibilities whilst offering attacking intent down the right-hand side.",
      "With £133.5million worth of new forwards and the totemic Fernandes in the attacking trident against Everton, United had dexterous playmakers to drop deep and spring through Amad, playing on the shoulder of the last defender. It led to a chance for Cunha and the penalty that Fernandes converted.",
      "Amad played on the wing in Amorim's first United match in charge at Ipswich. Four other wingers are in the bomb squad, either unwilling or incapable of meeting Amorim's demands.",
      "Another 'hidden' attacking asset is Leny Yoro, who is literally stepping up and playing more on the front foot.",
      "One of the last kicks from Rasmus Hojlund in the States was his boot against the post. He was appalled that Patrick Dorgu had shot at goal rather than gone across goal.",
      "Dorgu was well within his rights to shoot. Hojlund may have strayed offside, too. We have become accustomed to that reaction from Hojlund and he vented at Diogo Dalot in Stockholm a little over two weeks ago.",
      "It cannot be easy for Hojlund to continue as United's No.9 when they are enquiring about almost any attainable striker. He is in an identical position to Erik ten Hag last year when United asked every Tom, Dick and Harry if they would take over as manager. Ten Hag remained in situ after the head-hunting but was eventually summoned to the guillotine.",
      "Hojlund is digging his heels in amid United's efforts to flog him but it is unsustainable and could jeopardise the squad harmony. Hojlund was socialising with Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw as recently as United's penultimate night in Chicago. United need to be transparent with the Dane.",
      "This has been the most upbeat United pre-season since 2017. The quirk of that is United entered that summer having just won the Europa League final.",
      "Denying the 'bomb squad' members a seat on the plane to Chicago has indubitably helped. The players have publicly backed Amorim's handling of players who have caused him and the club problems. United are not treading on eggshells with Marcus Rashford any more after he was whisked away to Barcelona.",
      "Ten Hag had Jadon Sancho foisted onto him for pre-season last year and his working relationship with Rashford was practically irreparable. Senior figures at United want to provide unequivocal backing for Amorim and his authority is yet to be challenged over his handling of a player.",
      "The days when Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba rode roughshod over the manager are thankfully over.",
      "Andre Onana is expected to be match-fit for the Arsenal fixture but if he isn't then a 39-year-old deserves to be between the sticks for United.",
      "This tour was additional evidence that Altay Bayindir is the third-best of United's senior 'keepers. In a summer where United are exploring the possibility of recruiting a new goalie, it is peculiar that they are not actively looking to shift Bayindir, whose reputation hinges on a couple of penalty saves in a cup tie.",
      "Bayindir was utterly unconvincing again in the draw with Everton whereas Tom Heaton kept competently against Bournemouth. Onana has to demonstrate clear evidence that he has honed his technique when he does return and the first-choice goalkeeper position can be parked for a year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "The Reds will welcome Arsenal to Old Trafford for their season opener on August 17 and time is running out for them to source a new goal-getter for the visit of Mikel Arteta's side.",
      "It is no secret RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has claimed residency at the top of United's wish list, but they face staunch competition from Newcastle United for his signature.",
      "After reaching an agreement to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves on the opening day of the transfer window at the beginning of June, United were expected to get signings through the door at pace, particularly when it emerged they were interested in signing Bryan Mbeumo the following day.",
      "However, negotiations with Brentford took weeks, so much so he did not finalise his switch to Old Trafford until July 21. With that in mind, United are unlikely to rush into making an offer for Sesko just because Newcastle have made their move.",
      "United are changing how they operate in the transfer market this summer, trying to distance themselves from paying over the odds and rushing into deals.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada told United We Stand in June: \"He [Matheus Cunha] was an important one to get done. We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly.",
      "\"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Berrada is doing is very best to ensure United avoid having their pants pulled down in the window this summer, following several years of reckless spending.",
      "United have been sensible in their recruitment decisions so far this summer and are unlikely to change their approach, despite Newcastle's best efforts to try and get a head start in the pursuit of Sesko.",
      "As much as United need a striker and have taking a liking to the Slovenian, who scored 21 times for RB Leipzig last season, they know they can ill-afford to disrupt all ofthe good work that has been done already this summer by losing sight of the finances.",

      "Who needs to win the Europa League when you can win the Premier League Summer Series?",
      "Manchester United lifted a trophy at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday evening after beating West Ham and Bournemouth, and drawing against Everton, during the United States tour.",
      "The 'celebrations' were obviously muted, but the vibes around United at the end of the pre-season tour are undeniably better compared to the mood in the days building up to the trip across the Atlantic.",
      "The signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford for an initial £65million, announced a day before the flight to the USA, was the catalyst for a more optimistic outlook. It was important to sign Mbeumo in time to travel to the States, and there have been green shoots elsewhere in the friendlies.",
      "United have looked fitter, well-organised and capable of hurting their opponent in the final third. The players were handed individual fitness regimes during their holiday this summer and it seems to have paid off.",
      "Ruben Amorim's decision to exile players who had fallen below expectations has also seemed to pay off, with the players on the USA tour discussing the improved culture and morale in the dressing room.",
      "Amorim has banished the bad eggs. There is a feeling of harmony within the group and the players have seemed notably upbeat during sessions at the Endeavor Health Performance Centre.",
      "The performances themselves have been better. United cruised to victories against West Ham and Bournemouth, although the draw against Everton in the final game was a reminder that there is further work to do.",
      "For all the positivity on tour, some of the old problems remain, particularly in midfield, which is an area that Amorim needs to strengthen before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "United struggled with Everton's physicality in midfield and will struggle throughout the campaign if a fresh face is not added. Amorim also needs to sign a striker, potentially Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Speaking during half-time against Everton, Berrada spoke about transfers and promised that club officials are working long hours to ensure Amorim's squad receives additional reinforcements.",
      "“We have to do a lot of multitasking,\" he said. \"We have a team back home led by Jason, the recruitment team, that is working around the clock to ensure that we continue to find opportunities to strengthen our squad. There are lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure that we stay on top of it.”",
      "Berrada continued: “The mood has been very good. The culture, the standards, the values, we are trying to ensure that we create a team spirit that allows the players to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We have very high standards, Ruben is very clear about that and so is Jason [Wilcox]. It is something we want to see with the players, with the staff, with everyone, because what we want to do is to win and to start winning titles as soon as possible.",

      "Manchester United have made Benjamin Sesko their transfer priority this summer and it appears it is just themselves and Newcastle left in the race for his signature.",
      "At the moment, it appears that Sesko is torn, with the Magpies holding the luxury of Champions League football while United can offer him the chance to play a crucial role in Ruben Amorim's rebuild. Indications at present suggest that Sesko may well favour the Reds.",
      "However, there is still the matter of negotiating a fee with RB Leipzig which could throw up a hurdle for United considering that finances remain tight for Amorim and co. It is looking likely that United will need to spend around £70m for Sesko which shall only be affordable if player sales are agreed.",
      "Therefore, there is a chance that United may not be able to sign Sesko even if the Slovenian decides that he wants to move to Old Trafford. If that scenario plays out, the Reds will need to look at alternatives.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the summer that Jamie Vardy could be considered as a last resort option on a free transfer which would largely split opinions in the fanbase considering his age. Fortunately, there is another option who would likely be cheaper than Sesko but still provide a longer term solution than Vardy.",
      "Former Brentford forward Ivan Toney is currently plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al Ahli and has impressed, bagging 30 goals in all competitions last season. This form earned him a call-up to the England national team at the end of the campaign under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Toney has previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag was credited by ESPN with interest only to decide that Joshua Zirkzee was a better fit for his system.",
      "The 29-year-old returned to the United conversation this week as he commented: \"Let's go my son,\" underneath Bryan Mbeumo's social media post marking his debut for the club. At Brentford, Toney formed a lethal partnership with Mbeumo and clearly the pair remain close.",
      "If United have to pivot away from Sesko, Toney could be a safe option. He has played as a lone striker before, has excelled in the Premier League and already has an existing relationship with a key new addition to this squad.",
      "United may not be able to pay him what Al Ahli are, considering their new wage structure. But, perhaps Toney could be open to a wage cut considering he could move back to the Premier League, be a key player and increase his chances of being on the plane to the World Cup next summer.",
      "This is the sort of scenario Amorim will genuinely need to consider if a deal for Sesko cannot be completed.",

      "Manchester United are in the final stretch of pre-season ahead of the beginning of the Premier League campaign at home to Arsenal a week on Sunday.",
      "Anticipation among the supporters is undoubtedly building but before that first match against the Gunners, there are clearly two transfer priorities that need to be addressed. First, is the signing of a new centre-forward.",
      "Now, the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have given United more options at the top end of the pitch. However, neither man would prefer to be the one, in a 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Therefore, a new striker should be considered a necessity and, in fairness to the Reds, it appears to be United's current priority. RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko has been shortlisted as the top candidate to perform that role and there is talk that a bid has been lodged for his services.",
      "Currently, Newcastle are pushing hard to bring the Slovenian to St James' Park as a replacement for Alexander Isak. Should he choose to sign for United, it may still not be a done deal as the Reds would need to negotiate with the Bundesliga club in regards to a fee.",
      "Ultimately, this really needs to be completed before the game against Arsenal but, even if it is, there are no guarantees that Sesko could start that match due to his short transition time into the United squad. Should that priority be sorted with Sesko, or perhaps another striker, the focus needs to be on one outgoing in particular.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is arguably the only sellable asset that United want to part with this summer. Marcus Rashford was also one but his loan switch to Barcelona has already been concluded.",
      "Both Garnacho and Rashford represent 'pure profit' for United and with the latter already gone, it is up to the Reds to sell the former quickly. The Argentine is thought to favour staying in the Premier League and Chelsea are believed to be interested.",
      "But, will Enzo Maresca's side offer the amount of money needed to convince United that selling is the best option. Last month, it was claimed that Chelsea would only be willing to pay up to £30m for Garnacho which would be considered a cheap deal.",
      "Naturally, the Reds will be pushing for more but with the danger of Financial Fair Play (FFP) penalties, United will need to bring something back in for Garnacho. Even if that means just £30m.",

      "Manchester United could finally be about to find a solution to Ruben Amorim's long-winded search for a new striker this summer. United have missed out on two of their targets this window with Liam Delap joining Chelsea and Viktor Gyokeres moving to Arsenal.",
      "The Reds' poor end to last season has left Amorim's options short with no European football to offer. After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier in the window, United are now prioritising a new centre-forward.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is at the top of their list after the 22-year-old was snubbed by Arsenal. However, United aren't alone with Newcastle pushing hard to strike an agreement with RB Leipzig to sign the striker.",
      "A club-record deal worth at least £70million has been put on the table by Eddie Howe's men but it remains unknown what Sesko's official preference is. It's been widely reported that the Magpies are keen to get the deal concluded before the Premier League starts next weekend.",
      "United are believed to be keen on signing the Slovenia international but as of right now, they are yet to submit a formal bid. Should Sesko move to Newcastle and Amorim miss out on a striker for the third time, the club will be forced to look at Plan D or even Plan E.",
      "Ollie Watkins is, on paper, the next best option with the Aston Villa centre-forward boasting an impressive goalscoring record. The England international is understood to be available for transfer this summer with Unai Emery said to be willing to sell him.",
      "The Mirror have claimed that Watkins could be sold in order for Villa to sign Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea. That has been followed by The Athletic, who have reported that Chelsea would be open to letting him depart if the right deal emerges.",
      "It may not be the circumstance that United want to be in but it largely comes down to their poor performance last season. It remains to be seen whether they can afford Sesko, but if Newcastle win the race, United could benefit from the Jackson and Watkins domino effect.",
      "If Villa are willing to sell Watkins to bring in Jackson, the England international surely has to be bought. United know they can't go into the new season without another striker and the longer the window goes, the more every club will become desperate.",
      "Should Jackson be available for Villa and Emery push for it, the green light is there for Watkins. Signing the 29-year-old is less of a risk for United than Sesko due to his Premier League experience and it is highly likely to be a cheaper package to construct.",

      "\"It was a tough time in my career, but they’re the moments that either make you or break you,\" was Marcus Rashford's admission regarding his time playing under former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.",
      "While he admitted that his style of coaching was not conducive to good performances from the winger, Rashford felt that he learnt different qualities of perseverence under the Portuguese head coach. The next time that the United academy graduate was managed by someone from that part of Europe, his career at the club came to an end.",
      "While Ruben Amorim and Mourinho's nationalities are merely coincidental, the two men do share similarities when it comes to their man-management. Rashford's association with United may not have ended altogether yet but his loan move to Barcelona is the beginning of the end.",
      "In Catalonia, it appears they have a tailored plan in mind for Rashford which Mourinho is unlikely to agree with. Speaking on Monday after Rashford scored his first goal for Barca in a 5-0 victory over Daegu FC, his new head coach Hansi Flick explained his thoughts on where the United man shall be utilised.",
      "\"Rashford can play as a No. 9 [like Robert Lewandowski], and as a No.11 [like Raphinha],\" Flick explained. \"We put him [Rashford] in the centre today because Ferran Torres was injured.\"",
      "\"I always thought it was better for him to come from the side, especially the left side.\" This move to Barcelona is clearly a big final chance for Rashford who will know that if he does not perform, not only is his place at the World Cup next summer in doubt, but so is a permanent move to the La Liga giants.",
      "It seems if he is going to impress Thomas Tuchel and Flick, he will need to prove Mourinho wrong in the process.",

      "Newcastle United may have made the first move in the race to sign 22-year-old striker Benjamin Sesko, but Manchester United could reportedly use the selling club's desire for Rasmus Hojlund as a makeweight in a potential deal.",
      "United's summer transfer window has been all about improving their attack, after a miserable season in front of goal. Rising star Sesko from RB Leipzig fits the bill, but the Magpies have stolen a march on Ruben Amorim's side, submitting a bid of around £78 million.",
      "The Reds are yet to follow up their interest with a bid, with journalist Fabrizio Romano saying that they will advance their plans if they can get a firm answer from Sesko that he would like to join the club. It has been reported that Leipzig are interested in taking on Hojlund on loan if there is a deal to be done at Old Trafford, which could grease the wheels if United commit to the transfer.",
      "Hojlund himself is set on staying at Manchester United however, and he has repeatedly said that he is ready to fight for his place in the squad, whatever happens next. Improvements to the attack in the 10 positions, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joining the club, could benefit him over the course of the upcoming season.",
      "Commenter Cromwellswart says: \"By selling Hojlund and buying Sesko or whoever it maybe, we're simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. We can't just have Chido playing second fiddle to Sesko. It's clear we need Hojlund and a new striker, or we buy two new strikers. And I'm starting to get the feeling that I'd rather we kept Hojlund and looked elsewhere, than sell him to buy Sesko. Hojlund deserves another shot in this team.\"",
      "Realperson writes: \"We could do with Sesko and Hojlund competing for the striker role. Last season Hojlund was poor and lacking in confidence for most of it. He’s shown in his first season and in this preseason that he can play. Sesko would be new to the Premier League. I wouldn’t trust either to play every game well. Obi is young and developing. Zirkzee is a support striker and should be competing with Cunha and Mbuemo.\"",
      "A_grace says: \"A forward, a good defensive midfielder with pace and a new goalkeeper to replace Altay are definitely needed and every player must lift their game if Utd want to qualify for Europe this season. Hojlund should be kept to support the new striker.\"",
      "Others say that Hojlund does not have a future with the club if Sesko joins. Tt84 says: \"It seems like the players do not trust Hojlund, which I think means he has to go. I thought he did alright over the pre-season but that's only from what I read.\"",
      "LesJohnson writes: \"Amorim does not trust Hojlund, that is obvious, and is waiting for Zirkzee to get fit and play that vital link role up front.\"",
      "Bluecheetahs says: \"As much as I'd like him to stay and fight for his place, I truly believe a loan move to Leipzig (with Sesko coming to us) would be the best for this lad's career. I'd prefer Zirkzee as cover for Sesko... and dont forget Cunha and Mbeumo can both play as a striker.\"",

      "Former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown, who ‘remains very well-connected within the game’, has named the Blues as the ‘expected winner’ in the race to sign him, with an ‘answer given’.",
      "“Everybody is expecting Garnacho to leave,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“Chelsea are the one club who have shown a genuine desire to bring him in. He’s been linked with a lot of clubs, the likes of Tottenham and a few others, but none of them have made a move yet and Chelsea have.",

      "“I think he would get a sizeable contract at Chelsea, but I think to the point where he’s the kind of player that if you bought him for £30million and he was okay, not disastrous, but you wanted to shift him on next summer or the summer after, it feels very doable to Europe.",
      "“I do think it’s a low-risk deal. But then, if it is so low risk, then it is interesting that so far nobody has bitten. There seems to be very little interest aside from Chelsea, which is slightly surprising.”",

      "20) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in the agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "19) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. But it looks like Sesko is the man for United, which could see Newcastle return for Watkins.",

      "18) Arnaud Kalimuendo – Rennes to Brentford\nAfter scoring 17 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games last season, Kalimuendo is a wanted man. AC Milan are keen but Brentford have reportedly ‘made contact’. This link shows a willingness to sell Yoane Wissa, which is great news for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jeremy Jacquet – Rennes to Arsenal\nAnother defender, Mikel? That’s insane. Arsenal’s interest in Jacquet will only be accelarated should Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior leave. The latter is attracting interest from all over Europe, but Arteta wants to keep him. Arsenal even rejected an offer from Portugal earlier this summer for the Pole, who’s destined for a place on this rumour ranking very, very soon. A fresh report has suggested Arsenal could sign Jacquet and loan him back to Rennes, William Saliba style. This rumour just became more realistic…",

      "16) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year but Man Utd are winning the race. It looks like Newcastle are about to take another gargantuan L. What a summer it’s been for those guys.",

      "",
      "14) 🔽 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin recently in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £50m and expected to move due to his lack of desire to sign an extension. Guehi has also been linked with Liverpool, who could continue their assault on the Magpies by hijacking the deal…",

      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThere are no negotiations between United and Chelsea but Romano says the winger is giving his ‘full priority’ to the Club World Cup winners. The Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Poor Tyrique George knows he doesn’t stand a chance and has asked to leave. This club, man…",
      "",
      "11) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "10) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal has dropped down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

      "6) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nLiverpool rejected an offer of around £70m from Al-Hilal for Nunez in January and will not delude themselves into thinking a summer sale could generate nearly as much. But another piece in their Isak puzzle could fall into place thanks to the Magpies’ owners. PIF want to give the Saudi Pro League runners-up a shiny new centre-forward and Nunez has been earmarked as that man, with a club-to-club agreement now in place, per Romano. It all comes down to personal terms but it’s looking promising.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nLast Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by that evening, it was Sesko. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, United are now ‘closing in’ on the signing of the 22-year-old Slovenian, who wants Old Trafford over St James’ Park. That’s bad news for Liverpool and their pursuit of Isak, who might stay at Newcastle after all.",

      "4) 🆕 Evann Guessand – Nice to Aston Villa\nThe Villans have been linked quite a bit but an agreement with Nice came out of nowhere in the end. The Nice striker will join for £30m, which could open the door for Watkins to depart.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – Chelsea to Everton\nWell, that was an underwhelming year for Dewsbury-Hall…on a personal level, anyway. He barely played for Chelsea in the Premier League and is now set for a switch to the Hill Dickinson. This is a top move for the player and both clubs.",

And on that note, Arsenal are being linked with Rennes’ young centre-back Jeremy Jacquet, who recently signed a four-year contract extension.",

      "Fulham: Wide forward\nThe least active Premier League club this summer, Fulham have only signed a back-up goalkeeper despite a glaring need for a winger. Reiss Nelson could return, but it’s hardly inspiring. Craven Cottage has also been mentioned as a possible destination for Chelsea outcast Raheem Sterling.",

      "Manchester United: Striker\nLike many of their rivals, United are working on signing a player in their priority position. They’ve reportedly chosen Benjamin Sesko over Ollie Watkins — which may be smart, but feels awfully familiar. It’s like picking Rasmus Hojlund over Harry Kane, then signing Joshua Zirkzee over Victor Osimhen.",

      "Nottingham Forest: Centre-midfielder\nJudging by the links, Forest want a central midfielder and we’re on board. Dan Ndoye has replaced Anthony Elanga, so that issue is sorted. Another winger could arrive, but improving Nuno Espirito Santo’s midfield depth is the priority.",

      "Sunderland: Striker\nThe newly-promoted Black Cats have been busy, but they’re lacking quality up front. Chelsea’s Marc Guiu looks close to arriving on loan. That’s something, but not enough.",
      "RB Leipzig’s Lois Openda is reportedly under consideration, which would be one of the coups of the summer. It’s probably fantasy, but still.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Attacking midfielder\nAn attacking midfielder was already the priority — but now it’s urgent, with James Maddison picking up what looks like a serious injury. The poor guy has missed a lot of football already; an ACL tear is the last thing he needs.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was a top target even before Maddison’s setback. That deal was nearly done until Forest threatened legal action and Spurs backed off.",

      "",
      "Wolves: Goalkeeper\nJose Sa was supposed to be replaced by Sam Johnstone, but has lived to fight another year. We’ll probably see a new goalkeeper arrive, with Johnstone now a target for Burnley.",

      "Newcastle fans are very accustomed to board/owner level incompetence, but we genuinely thought we’d got past that when PIF came in. Staveley and her husband seemed to know what they wanted and could make it happen. Since she left we’re approaching comedy club status again. The CEO needs replacing because of illness, which isn’t anyone’s fault, but a serious business wouldn’t sit idle and just be in limbo like we are.",
      "The Sporting Director was a useless sh*te who seemingly did f*** all across all his time with the club, but left just at the most important time of the year with no replacement lined up, apparently having done nothing to prepare the ground for new transfers.",
      "The entire recruiting team needs an overhaul. So many of the players we’ve gone after never wanted to join. Players we’ve landed in the past we had little or no competition for – Botman, Isak, Bruno, Tonali all landed with minimal fuss, so what are we doing differently now than 3-4 years ago? Was Mitchell actually right in saying our recruitment set up was bad? If that were true, how has most of our business worked out so well but this summer it’s been so terrible? Lessons have to be learned.",
      "I completely get why other fans are fed up with hearing about how PSR is holding Newcastle back when there is so much catastrophic ineptitude on display for all to see. We have money to spend, what we appear to lack is any nous in identifying the players who want to join, and the skill to negotiate the right deal.",
      "The Sesko transfer – we’re haggling over a sell on clause according to reports. Why? We need him! We’re absolutely desperate and we’ve not even addressed the other gaping holes in the squad.",
      "The rewards of landing him are so bleeding obvious. All of a sudden from looking utterly f**ked we’ll have two very good strikers. At my most optimistic I believe there might be a  path back for Isak if Liverpool are not just posturing about walking away from a deal.",
      "But even if Isak gets sold if Sesko joins, which seems more likely, Newcastle will have money to spend on the other areas of the squad we’ve not even begun to address. Its win-win and could turn the summer around completely. No-one will care how many targets we missed at the start of the summer if by the end of it our squad is in better shape than at the end of May.",
      "Failure to get Sesko and we are in the worst of all worlds. Guedes from PSG is the next cab off the rank apparently – we’re down to wanting PSG’s third choice striker and supposed to be enthusiastic about this.",
      "This genuinely feels like a home-grown catastrophe, and there has to be accountability. We have to have a Sporting Director who works well with Eddie Howe and team. There has to be a better scouting and recruitment team who don’t waste time on deals with players who simply don’t want to be at Newcastle. And instead of this boom and bust cycle, there has to be a CEO with a strategy of mitigating the unassailable PSR gap over the 10-15 years it may take, with a decision on the new stadium or expanded St James’, new training ground and facilities, and huge investment in youth academies and recruitment.\nJames",

It is just a matter of time and to pretend otherwise is delusional. All Newcastle can do is collect the money. Unlike Woody, I assume they won’t be donating it to charity.",
      "All the talk of loyalty and betrayal is nonsense. It’s not a relationship that’s based on unconditional love, and football clubs (and fanbases) only want players to stay when it’s of benefit to them, and will cut a player loose as soon as it behoves them to do so (age, loss of form, injury, need the money). Why should more be expected for players?",
      "While it would have been nice to receive a fee for Trent, I couldn’t care less when he left, or how he left. The club is the thing and he’s no longer a Liverpool player. Same for Coutinho, Suarez, Torres, McManaman and Owen. I just remember the good times and move on.",

      "A word on Wissa\nI’ve noticed a bit of sympathy shown towards Wissa on this site so please allow me to give a Brentford fan’s perspective on this.",
      "First of all, almost all of the information being reported in the media is conjecture. Nobody involved has gone on the record and said anything of note (apart from some fairly bland comments from Keith Andrews). So we mostly don’t know what is true and what isn’t.",
      "This, it seems, doesn’t stop the media from reporting as if they are “facts”. But let’s be honest, most of the noise here is almost certainly coming from Wissa’s agent who’s trying to stir things up to engineer a move for his client and a massive payday for himself. Maybe, just maybe, there is some ulterior motive there that makes him an unreliable source.",
      "Was he ‘promised’ by Brentford that he could leave this Summer? Does anyone truly believe that?!? I’ve no doubt there may have been some conversations along the lines of “if we get a sensible bid we won’t stand in your way”, but that hardly amounts to a promise. And £25m hardly amounts to a sensible bid for a player who was only outscored by Salah last season for non-penalty goals.",
      "Of the facts we do “know”, Wissa left the Portugal training camp early and wasn’t in the squad for the friendly v QPR last weekend. He also appears to be training separately from the main squad (although even that isn’t certain). I’m struggling to see why there should be any sympathy for the player’s behaviour that has led to this situation? No player should be holding their employer to ransom like this. And I would argue that a player of Wissa’s talent has essentially hit his ceiling already anyway. He’s not being coveted by Newcastle to be their main striker. Maybe he wants the extra coin and champions league prestige, but I wouldn’t say it’s really stepping up to be a back-up centre forward for the 5th placed PL club compared to being the first choice at the 10th placed PL club. There’s only one way Wissa gets even close to matching the 19 goals he scored last season, and that’s staying with Brentford (and not being a d*ck about it).",
      "That’s all to say, I wouldn’t begrudge him the move if it’s what he wants. But it has to be on our terms, and it’s disappointing that some (maybe most) of the reporting seems to be with a slant towards Wissa and/or Newcastle’s perspective, with very little in support of little-old Brentford’s position.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "Crystal Palace – one step back, two steps forward?\nI, along with I’m sure the majority of football fans, wish Crystal Palace well in their appeal against demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League. However, if the worst should happen and the decision not be overturned, they shouldn’t be too down, because I think the Conference League is a Cup they could actually have a damned good chance of winning.",
      "Sure, the Europa League is a higher standard and offers the dream of qualifying for the Champions League via the back door and Palace fans could argue with some credence that if a largely rotten Spurs team could win that then why not them, but it would be quite the long shot, whereas in the Conference League, they ought to be within the half dozen strongest contenders, particularly if they reached the latter stages with no realistic fears of relegation from the Premier League.",
      "Sure, it’d be something of a consolation prize, but I’m sure West Ham fans treasure the memories of their win two seasons back and Palace themselves had a similar experience in winning the FA Cup – their first ever major trophy. When you weigh that up against merely competing in the Europa League and likely being knocked out along the way, it might be a genuine decision which you’d rather go for…\nNick, Bristol",

But doesn’t that cascade down? 4-7th play to decide Champions League teams, then 6-9th for the other European places. At the other end, 15-19 playing for relegation places. Hypothetical: VAR chalk off an Arsenal goal v West Ham in September, they come second, but play a one-off v City for the League?",

      "So let me get this straight. Ozzy, AFC’s answer to what he feels is the unfairness of a league playing as few as 38 games and not enough games, therefore, to even out that unfairness – so really needing multiple season’s worth of games to even things out – is to play a one-off decider? Seriously? As if there could be no issues with say, one team also playing a Champions League final at around this time or a major player with a serious injury for that one game, etc?",
      "North America doesn’t do cups the way football teams in Europe do. The ‘league’ is not a league just jostling for position to get into the cup-like playoffs. In the case of baseball with 162 ‘regular season’ games, they play enough to even out most issues – hence why data-oriented (aka Moneyball) stats work.(Teams can have massive dips in performance and still make the playoffs.) Meanwhile,  ice-hockey and basketball play 82 games, while (American football) only 17.   Yet even with such a massive difference in regular season games, they all still do ‘playoffs.’ At least in ice-hockey and basketball the playoff is a grind, with 4 rounds of best-of-seven series to get to the final and win. This playoff scenario is due to the huge geography of North America limiting teams to playing an even schedule between each other thus being separated into divisions where they will play more games against divisional opponents with a few road-trips thrown in. So they aren’t balancing ‘unevenness’ in the way Ozzy is thinking with playoffs. They’re balancing the unevenness of games against each other.",
      "The reality is that if just one player as in Rodri is the total reason a season was derailed then that is an issue that City’s management should have addressed. And the data shows that the new manager impact is in fact neutral.",

While there are a number of the England team whose performances were immense, Chloe was arguably the stand-out character of the team.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly turned down the chance to sell Harry Maguire this summer and instead want him to sign a new contract.",
      "Maguire has been a much-maligned figure at Old Trafford since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019.",
      "He became the most expensive defender in the world at the time – a title he still holds – with Manchester City’s £77m signing of Josko Gvardiol two years ago the closest contender.",
      "Maguire has made 246 appearances for United over the last six years, winning the Carabao Cup as club captain in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024.",
      "He wore the armband from 2019 to 2023, having been handed the role by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before Erik ten Hag passed it on to Bruno Fernandes in July 2023.",
      "The 32-year-old’s performances have often been heavily scrutinised, and United have looked to move him on in recent transfer windows. However, new(ish) co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and head coach Ruben Amorim clearly rate him highly.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, they are both such big fans that United want to give Maguire a new contract so he can ‘see out his career at Old Trafford’.",
      "This decision has been made despite strong interest in the defender, the report from Mike Keegan says.",
      "Indeed, the Premier League giants – who have signed four first-team players so far this summer – have ‘rebuffed approaches from clubs in England and abroad’.",
      "There are ‘a number of interested parties’, with three Premier League sides and two from Italy ‘exploring a move’ for Maguire, only to be ‘turned away’.",
      "The interested clubs have been informed that ‘the likelihood is that the England defender is likely to extend his contract – and spend the rest of his career at Old Trafford’.",
      "Maguire’s £190,000-a-week contract expires at the end of 2025/26, but the player ‘is keen to stay’ as he ‘desires emulating the likes of Denis Irwin, Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson as key United mainstays’.",
      "There have been no talks over an extension yet, but United are sending out the message that they want to keep him.",
      "If no agreement can be reached, Maguire ‘is unlikely to be short of options’ and is ‘aware of the stunning season former team-mate Scott McTominay’ at Napoli. Presumably because he doesn’t live under a rock.",
      "The Turkish big three, Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are among Maguire’s ‘admirers’, while French clubs AS Monaco and Marseille ‘are monitoring the situation’. Besiktas and Fenerbahce are both managed by ex-United bosses Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho, respectively.",
      "There’s no mention of the proposed new deal including a wage cut or performance-related incentives, and any extension appears to be nowhere near agreed.",
      "As Maguire’s contract enters its final year, clubs abroad can begin negotiating a pre-contract agreement from January 1, assuming he doesn’t commit to new terms before then.",
      "READ NEXT: ‘Selling club’ is not a slur and teams shouldn’t fear it – Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City don’t",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Man Utd hero Patrice Evra has hit out at the Red Devils fans over their “disgusting” treatment of one player as Amorim claims his side “choke in every game”.",
      "A former head of the PGMOL has ‘demanded a rule change’ after one moment in Manchester United’s 1-0 loss to Chelsea on Friday night.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists that he must give his players “the feeling that we cannot lose a match” rather than look to new signings in the summer.",
      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire."

      "Clubs and fans seem terrified of the ‘selling club’ branding that everyone bar Real Madrid should embrace. Spurs and Newcastle must be more Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Modern football fandom is beset with two-word comebacks that should really go directly in the bin.",
      "Lazy, tribal, point-scoring shitpost retorts to shitpost statements. ‘Warra trophy’. ‘Cry more’. ‘Rent free’.",
      "But there’s one two-word sobriquet that most clubs themselves appear to fear above all others, when in reality it belongs in the same social-media bonfire as the rest.",
      "‘Selling club’.",
      "It is a desperate moniker to become saddled with, a slur almost impossible to shake once it has taken hold. It’s one that speaks to so many of football’s wider talking points: of profit above glory; of placing more emphasis on the balance sheet than the league table; of, at the most basic level, a lack of ambition.",
      "But there is something else very important about it, and that is the fact it is complete and utter and total bollocks. There is an utter bereft hollow meaninglessness at the core of the jet-black soul of ‘Selling Club’.",
      "Because do you know which clubs are selling clubs? Almost all of them. And with the possible exception of Real Madrid, for any club that is not a ‘selling club’ at this time it is down to either rank incompetence or not for the want of trying.",
      "Manchester United have spent much of the summer desperately trying to be a selling club. Tottenham and Arsenal both historically suck at the art of selling players.",
      "With Spurs they either sell players long after the need has become obvious, or grudgingly unwillingly let star names go at the peak of their value but in such a way that no useful reinvestment of that windfall can ever follow.",
      "Arsenal are simply incapable of selling players at all. At least, not for any meaningful value. The £22m they received from Real Madrid for Nicolas Anelka 25 years ago remains one of their biggest ever player sales, and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "Against these you have Liverpool and Manchester City, who are just much better at it. Liverpool will not have entered this summer thinking “WE SIMPLY MUST SELL LUIS DIAZ” but at the same time knew there was a price that was worth selling him at, and when someone offered it they accepted.",
      "And it’s not an isolated case. Unlike Arsenal or Spurs, they are happy enough to cash in on even talented homegrown players when the right offer comes along. Our gut feel is that if Jarell Quansah was at Spurs or Arsenal, they would not have sold him for £30m.",
      "But that readiness and willingness to trade in the market is a big factor in why Liverpool have been able to spend as they have this summer.",
      "The way in which they reaped the benefits of selling Philippe Coutinho for the very daftest of money has entered football legend, and those benefits continue to be felt to this day.",
      "Man City operate similarly. They spend plenty, but they are better than most at recouping it as well. There are inevitably mistakes along the way with this approach. Cole Palmer, for instance. But who can really argue with City’s decision to move on Raheem Sterling or Ferran Torres or Gabriel Jesus or Leroy Sane at prices around the £50m mark.",
      "Even though selling Julian Alvarez for around £70m left them short at times last season, it’s hard to argue that wasn’t reasonable business for an understudy.",
      "But again, it’s simply not a deal one can imagine Spurs or Arsenal or Man United pulling off at this time.",
      "A shrewder club than Spurs might, for instance, have considered cashing in on Brennan Johnson this summer. His stock is high after scoring the winning goal in Bilbao, and he is a player who catches the eye because he is very, very good at one particular thing: arriving late and finding space in the penalty area to score from close-range when his opposite number or full-back puts a cross into the box.",
      "It’s certainly a very useful skill to have, and in the right team is absolutely deadly. He is also really quite average at almost everything else. There were many potential ways to upgrade there for minimal or even no financial outlay.",
      "But it’s simply not the way Spurs operate. Always the most painfully self-aware of the fragility of their ‘Big Six’ status, Spurs are perhaps more afeared than anyone of selling any player who might still have some value. Instead they end up with a stockpile that leaves them quite unable to name an even halfway coherent Champions League squad and a logjam for incomings as well thanks to a squad that pulls off the trick of being both bloated yet desperately lacking in so many key areas.",
      "While there are some teams who are good at selling and some that are bad, there needs to be a separate category altogether for Chelsea. We are grudgingly and confusedly coming round to the view that their objectively insane transfer strategy might just be the most correct one for an insane world.",
      "Theirs is not necessarily a route open to other clubs in the way the City and Liverpool blueprints are. And Chelsea have always been pretty handy at this even in the Abramovich days. But under Clearlake they have leaned into it so successfully that even their stupidest signings end up stupid like a fox.",
      "Spent over £30m on Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for some reason? Don’t worry, Everton will make sure you wipe your feet.",
      "Overspent on Joao Felix even after watching him go through a deeply unimpressive loan spell with absolutely no obvious reason to expect anything different on a permanent basis? Here comes the Saudi gravy train.",
      "Burnley are going to give them £20m for Armando Broja as well as a similar amount for Lesley Ugochukwu and £14m for Bashir Humphreys.",
      "And it’s not just teams lower down the foodchain who very much enjoy handing Chelsea vast sums of money. Arsenal simply cannot get enough of handing Chelsea vast sums of money.",
      "We’re not saying there’s anything particularly admirable about Chelsea’s vast football player megamart where players are bought and sold for absurd fees and daft contracts, but there’s something extraordinary about their ability to make their successes vast and even their failures, at worst, not that costly.",
      "Someone, somewhere will, over the weeks ahead, cough up £80m for Nicolas Jackson. And you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "As Spurs make announcements about Radu Dragusin that declare their fifth-choice centre-back will be wearing the number three shirt next season, other clubs are actually selling these players and getting something for them. Like Vinted but for billionaires.",
      "Newcastle are told time and again they must not sell Alexander Isak because it would make them a ‘selling club’. But that’s only true if they don’t actually spend that money on improving the team and the squad.",
      "Because the boring reality behind the ‘selling club’ slur is that what you’re actually describing is a trading club.",
      "And that is what almost all football clubs are, or should strive to be. It was always true, but never more so than now with PSR and squad limits ready to hurt those who can’t get this right."

Without both, this becomes very difficult.’",

      "After taking well over a month to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United are continuing their one-iron-in-the-transfer-fire approach by putting all of their efforts into signing a new No.9 this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the man they want and we can safely assume a first formal bid – if and when it arrives – will fall short of the mark, like the second formal bid, and maybe even a third, before Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds his hands up and pays the piper.",
      "Either that or Sesko chooses Newcastle, which will be absolutely fine by Ruben Amorim, who has become perhaps the greatest-ever purveyor of the This Is Manchester United call to arms, despite being – or perhaps because he is – the worst Manchester United manager in the Premier League era.",
      "After a harrowing first season and with so-called ‘bad eggs’ either moving to Barcelona or currently training away from the rest of the squad while seeking an exit, Amorim has set his sights on footballers with a genuine love for Manchester United.",
      "By all accounts he’s found that deep-seated adoration in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, to whom he offered telling, on-brand advice before they decided to make their dream moves.",
      "“In the meetings with Bryan, with Cunha, we said that. Don’t go to a club because of the manager. Go because of the idea of the club. And they are here because of the idea of the club.”",
      "It’s a non-negotiable he’s stayed true to throughout the transfer window having made the vow before the end of last season when asked about a possible approach for Viktor Gyokeres: “We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "It’s a requirement of any aspiring United player which nearly cost Amorim the signing of Mbeumo, and may well have resulted in the club paying over the odds for the 25-year-old, with Brentford not at all happy that they approached him before them.",
      "But with innumerable post-Sir Alex Ferguson signings seeing a move to Old Trafford as a means to a hefty pay cheque and as their final destination in the worst possible ‘f*** it, I’ve made it’ sort of way, bringing about a whole club malaise that’s seen them plumb extraordinarily low depths, Amorim has quite rightly identified hunger as the key trait in new signings beyond them being excellent at football. If only it didn’t then take so bleeding long to sign them.",
      "We’re aware that a football club that “would have been bust by Christmas” had it not been for the lunch-denying, ticket price-increasing, redundancy king isn’t flush enough to be making offers for multiple players in multiple positions at the same time, but this linear approach to a transfer window has already cost Amorim the chance of a pre-season with a new striker, and threatens to leave him without another much-needed addition when the season starts in less than two weeks.",
      "They clearly have and have had the funds to sign all of Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Sesko, so why not look to sign them at the same time rather than waiting for one to be confirmed before moving onto the next? It’s like a toddler eating a meal from highest-value item to lowest. Don’t forget the central midfield broccoli, guys.",
      "Omar Berrada promised in June to “do our best to do more signings quickly”, adding that “when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money”.",
      "So far they’ve met Cunha’s £62.5m release clause, took 44 days between first contact with Mbeumo and paying Brentford £17m over his market value to sign him, and are currently waiting to either pay the €80m Leipzig want on the terms they set for Sesko or walking away from a deal for a player who’s certainly now the club’s top target if not necessarily Amorim’s – he’s keen on Ollie Watkins – before presumably making a late-window dash to sign a central midfielder.",
      "Because let’s be absolutely clear – Amorim really needs a new central midfielder. He’s walking into a season knowing that none of his current possible pairings will work. Fabrizio Romano has revealed they dropped their not-so-secret interest in Joao Palhinha as Amorim decided he wanted a “less holding defensive midfielder – still defensive but with more intensity in their vision”.",
      "They don’t have that guy, and although they’ve been linked with Sporting’s Morten Hjulmand and Valencia’s Javi Guerra while ignoring the midfielder Romano is essentially describing there in Douglas Luiz, judging by the strategy of the transfer window thus far, United won’t even have made contact with a preferred option, let alone asked for the requisite pictures of them in a Cristiano Ronaldo shirt as a ten-year-old before initiating club-to-club talks.",
      "Amorim is to blame for the Sesko hold-up in so much as United are waiting for the striker to ‘commit’ to them over Newcastle before making a bid. But that in no way stops his bosses from multi-tasking. A lack of funds may do, but amid claims throughout the window that United must sell before they buy, they’ve sold precisely no-one and yet are prepared to take their spending to well over £200m if they get the green light from Sesko.",
      "The transfer window will be a success if United sign a striker and midfielder thanks to Amorim’s hard-and-fast rule on those new signings, but the start to his second season has been hamstrung by the club’s apparent inability to negotiate two signings at the same time.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has hatched a plan to ‘expose’ his ‘lazy’ Manchester United players during the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Ruben Amorim has revealed what was said to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in transfer talks to help Manchester United beat Newcastle to signing them.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly excited at the prospect of Benjamin Sesko joining with the Red Devils ‘very optimistic’ a deal will get done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s ‘spending is to continue’ after landing Benjamin Sesko as they will turn their attention to a new top target.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative."

      "Newcastle and Manchester United have both made bids for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 17:47, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle and Manchester United have both lodged bids in the region of £70m.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes on Man Utd's need for further additions: \"We needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up more and I think that is what the club are trying to do. Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Monday 4 August 2025 08:03, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's \"lazy\" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",
      "Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: \"It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
