      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a dream start to life at Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick tore up Ruben Amorim's plan for Bryan Mbeumo just days after replacing the former Manchester United boss. The ex-midfielder was appointed as his replacement until the end of the season earlier this month.",
      "And Carrick has enjoyed a dream start, having won each of his opening two games against Manchester City and Arsenal. One of his main success stories has been the form of summer signing Mbeumo.",
      "The Cameroonian scored against both City and the Gunners, taking his season record to nine goals in all competitions since his arrival from Premier League rivals Brentford. And despite his form having not changed too much since Carrick’s arrival, the Middlesbrough boss is seemingly taking a very different approach with his demands for the forward.",
      "According to ESPN, former boss Amorim was keen to use Mbeumo’s versatility by employing him in a variety of positions across the frontline. But Carrick was more keen on the forward playing more as a central option with licence to roam.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are stationed to assist him on either flank, with Bruno Fernandes acting as provider. That plan might now need a slight tweak with Dorgu out for an extended period, having picked up an injury against Arsenal.",
      "Asked earlier this month what is different under Carrick, Mbeumo said: “A bit of everything. Training is different, mentality is different. We know we only have one aim and one way to go, so we have to do everything to do it.",
      "\"Every manager has his own character and thinks differently and the manager obviously knows the club very well because he's a legend here as a player, everyone wants to try and do their best as well.”",
      "Former Arsenal star Emmanuel Petit has recently been full of praise for Mbeumo and his performances. He said: “I saw exactly what I thought about this player against Arsenal, it’s Mbeumo. I think in terms of movement, he’s very intelligent.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been in brilliant form since his return from AFCON(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“He’s got this flair in front of the goal. He’s very good in terms of assists as well.” I love his work rate. I love his behaviour on the pitch, technically, mentally as well. But more importantly, I like his movement, the link with his players all the time.",
      "“He brings something different up front. He’s not that physical, but in the meantime, he puts everything he has on the pitch. But I love him because he’s very intelligent.",
      "“When I saw Manchester United buy him in the last transfer market, I thought, this is a good bargain.”",
      "Mbeumo will be aiming to extend his brilliant recent form this coming weekend as United continue their push for a spot in the top four. The Red Devils host Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Representing a prestigious club like Manchester United can leave an indelible mark on a player, making it incredibly challenging to call time on a career in Europe. This was undoubtedly true for Javier Hernandez, who flourished after signing for the club under Sir Alex Ferguson but felt an emotional toll when his career at the top began to near its end.",
      "Hernandez arrived at United in 2010, the same summer he burst onto the global stage with Mexico's World Cup squad in South Africa. He adapted swiftly to English football, netting 20 goals across all competitions as Ferguson's side clinched the Premier League and reached the Champions League final in his debut campaign.",
      "The striker, known to fans as Chicharito, maintained double-figure league tallies in each of the following two seasons but failed to replicate that form under David Moyes. When Louis van Gaal took charge, securing regular first-team football appeared an even greater challenge.",
      "Hernandez received little opportunity from United's incoming Dutch manager. He featured in Van Gaal's opening league fixture but managed only 45 minutes, departing on loan a mere two weeks later and eventually leaving on a permanent basis in summer 2015, when Bayer Leverkusen came calling.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Chicharito might have played for United for the final time but he was still capable of proving his worth in Europe's elite divisions. The Mexican boasted a one-in-two goal average in Germany and netted 16 times in 55 Premier League games for West Ham on his return to England, despite having to adjust to working under three different manager across just over two seasons.",
      "He left West Ham in the summer of 2019, joining Sevilla, only to leave Spain after just a few months to join Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy in January 2020. More encouraging times lay ahead for the forward, but he was visibly emotional when acknowledging that beginning a fresh chapter signalled the conclusion of his European journey.",
      "\"I wanted to speak to you guys because the thing is about to get done,\" Hernandez, who is now 37 years of age, said in an emotional video. \"It's almost certain that I'm going to LA. It's okay, everything is perfect, it's only that, well it's like the beginning of my retirement.\"",
      "Chicharito's passion for the game and being at his best was evident as he broke down in tears",
      "Addressing his father, who tried to interject, he continued: \"Dad, try to understand me. Don't worry, look, what I mean is that we're saying goodbye to a career that we put a lot of effort on and we worked, and I know you guys also feel it. We're going to look at the bright side, but whether we like it or not we are retiring from the European dream.\"",
      "Hernandez's fresh start stateside saw him find the net 39 times across 82 Galaxy appearances before heading back to CD Guadalajara, the club where his journey first began prior to that major transatlantic move.",
      "A storybook homecoming was fairly quiet in terms of goals, with just four in 39 outings before his departure was announced last month. At the time of writing he is free agent with no formal retirement announcement having materialised.",

      "Michael Carrick has made a perfect start at Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was present at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday as Manchester United orchestrated an impressive win against Arsenal. The United co-owner will be delighted with the impact made by interim head coach Michael Carrick, having summoned the former midfielder for a private chat following the latest triumph.",
      "Consecutive victories against Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted United into fourth place in the Premier League standings and strengthened their hopes of securing a Champions League spot. The race remains tight, however, with a group of clubs chasing the same positions and just five points separating United from Sunderland in 11th place.",
      "Erik ten Hag was already in charge at Old Trafford when Ratcliffe purchased a stake in the club in February 2024. United endured a difficult league campaign that year and were weighing up alternative options before the Dutchman guided them to FA Cup success, earning himself a one-year extension.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Shortly before Ten Hag was dismissed in October 2024, Ratcliffe publicly backed the manager, saying: \"I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day it's not my call. It's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how we best run the team in many different respects.\"",
      "\"I agree the Erik ten Tag and [former sporting director] Dan Ashworth decisions were errors. I think there were some mitigating circumstances, but ultimately they were errors. I accept that and I apologise for that.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted renewing Erik ten Hag's contract in 2024 was a mistake(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "After Ten Hag's departure, United turned to Ruben Amorim following his standout achievements with Sporting CP. While the Portuguese coach guided United to the Europa League final, his league record was less convincing, with just 15 wins from 47 matches. Despite this, Ratcliffe frequently spoke highly of Amorim's efforts during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "In an interview with BBC Sport in March 2025, Ratcliffe said: \"If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job to be honest. I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. He's an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time.\"",
      "Pressure mounted on Amorim after United finished 15th in the league and were beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final. Reflecting on the situation during an appearance on The Business podcast in October, Ratcliffe said: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Ratcliffe has not yet spoken publicly about Carrick since appointing him interim head coach earlier this month. Still, the former England midfielder can take encouragement from being chosen ahead of past United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and club legends Ruud van Nistelrooy and Darren Fletcher.",
      "After the Arsenal victory, Carrick postponed his post-match media duties in order to speak directly with Ratcliffe. When approached by journalists, Ratcliffe declined to answer questions, jokingly saying \"just get the smile\".",
      "Asked later about the exchange with the United co-owner, Carrick told Viaplay: \"No, not much as you would expect, I think. There's a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he's delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes is approaching a key juncture at Manchester United as the club consider handing their captain a new contract(Image: PA)",
      "Bruno Fernandes has established himself as a modern legend at Manchester United, though his long-term future at Old Trafford remains uncertain. The club captain continues to attract speculation about a potential summer departure and has been candid about the situation in recent interviews.",
      "Fernandes has addressed speculation surrounding Saudi Arabian interest last summer when Al-Hilal were allegedly willing to stump up £100million for his services. The 31-year-old disclosed in December how former manager Ruben Amorim was instrumental in persuading him to remain, though he suggested United seemed willing to entertain the bid.",
      "This could prove significant if comparable proposals materialise at the end of this season, with his existing deal set to run until summer 2027. United retain an option to extend that commitment by an additional 12 months but the prospect of securing a nine-figure fee for a player approaching his twilight years might prove irresistible.",
      "Fernandes is understood to be seeking wages that would establish him as the club's highest-paid player by a considerable margin should he pen fresh terms. Nevertheless, United might consider it wise to capitalise on his value as one of several possible avenues in what has emerged as a crucial matter for the club.",
      "There's arguably no player currently at United who possesses greater worth than Fernandes. Not merely in terms of prospective market value but also regarding how significantly the side improves when he's around.",
      "Consequently, it's plausible the club will determine it's in their best interests to invest by offering him fresh terms. Fernandes is reportedly demanding a £400,000-a-week deal should he sign new terms at Old Trafford, given his next contract will likely be the final major deal of his career.",
      "It represents a considerable increase from the £300,000 a week he's currently on. Nevertheless, with Casemiro already confirmed to depart in the summer, removing his £375,000-a-week wages from the books will liberate a substantial amount from the salary structure.",
      "There remains a danger in offering a lengthy new deal to a player who turns 32 in September, though. Liverpool serve as a recent cautionary tale after rewarding Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk with fresh contracts last year, only to witness both veterans struggle to replicate their past levels so far this season.",
      "There's the additional condition that Fernandes allegedly wishes to wait and see who gets appointed as the next permanent boss before making his commitment. But following Michael Carrick's flawless beginning as interim boss, which has seen his chances of landing the role improve, that might not remain a concern for much longer.",
      "Fernandes has been open in admitting he'd accept a move to Saudi Arabia if he was no longer wanted at United",
      "The alternative route worth considering is to capitalise on Fernandes' sale while the opportunity remains favourable. Given his age, there's no certainty United will ever receive bids matching those currently being discussed should they opt to retain their skipper for another season.",
      "The Saudi Pro League has proved a valuable negotiating chip for Premier League sides when moving on particular players in recent times. Middle Eastern clubs are prepared to pay premium fees for marquee signings in a bid to enhance their brand, and speculation linking Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr with Fernandes has continued despite their failure to secure the player last summer.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11 in December, he acknowledged he was receptive to playing in Saudi Arabia and said: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain. I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.\"",
      "The monetary incentive is also remarkable, with Fernandes allegedly receiving a contract proposal worth approximately £700,000 per week. After six years at United, there's a possibility this summer could mark the decisive moment for both club and player if all concerned agree a departure serves everyone's interests.",
      "Saudi powerhouses are unlikely to be alone in their interest should it emerge that Fernandes is available. However, the situation is complex given fewer European clubs would be capable of matching Saudi financial muscle.",
      "Bayern Munich have recently been touted as another potential destination, one that would fulfil Fernandes' ambition to continue competing at the highest level. The German giants have ramped up their spending in recent years, with Harry Kane aged 30 when Bayern paid around £100m to secure him from Tottenham nearly three years ago.",
      "United's skipper could follow Casemiro's example by leaving Old Trafford as a free agent(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "In the same Canal 11 interview mentioned earlier, Fernandes also addressed his other preferences after leaving United, saying: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired. I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy... my daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal... the first option would be [former employers] Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting. But I don't want to ruin the image that was left.\"",
      "Money matters but from a practical standpoint, securing a transfer fee for Fernandes isn't necessarily paramount. In fact, allowing his existing contract to run its course and triggering the 12-month extension to retain him at the club until 2028 may prove wisest.",
      "By taking this approach, United would preserve the greatest possible opportunity of maximising the midfielder's remaining peak years. He could then depart in 2028, at which point he'll be 33, and would still be positioned to secure a profitable contract elsewhere given he'd be moving as a free agent.",
      "There's a chance Fernandes could head for the United exit this summer amid talk of big-money bids from Saudi Arabia(Image: Getty)",
      "In this scenario, United wouldn't be required to boost the player's salary and would have greater certainty regarding their timeframe for identifying a replacement. Admittedly, the club would be forgoing the opportunity to secure a substantial fee for their star, but players of Fernandes' calibre are rare, so that could be a worthwhile trade-off to guarantee the rest of his peak years are at Old Trafford.",
      "United paid a combined £67.6m to acquire Fernandes from Sporting in 2020, presuming all performance-related clauses in the agreement have been triggered. Should he depart in 2028, that would amount to approximately £8m per year (excluding salaries) across his eight-and-a-half years in Manchester.",
      "Most would consider that a reasonable investment for a player who has elevated expectations at the club during his time there. Therefore, maintaining the status quo before an amicable exit at the conclusion of his existing deal could prove satisfactory.",

The 29-year-old left United for Napoli for a fee of around £25million, a sale crucial to the club's compliance with financial fair play (FFP) regulations.",
      "Chelsea icon Zola was adamant that FFP rulings had to play a part in McTominay's sale due to the talent United were losing in the midfielder. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, the 59-year-old said: \"Certain choices will never be understood. I want to think that Manchester United sold him for reasons related to financial fair play.",
      "\"Otherwise I really don't get it. He's a complete footballer, he knows how to be on the pitch, he does everything. And he also scores a lot.\"",
      "Zola's comments ring true even more now as he continues to go from strength to strength both for club and for country. However, due to McTominay's homegrown status at United, it seemed like a no-brainer for then-manager Erik ten Hag to sell the Scot and recruit elsewhere in 2024.",

      "Manuel Ugarte signed a five-year deal just days later for a fee rising to £50m with bonuses, departing Paris Saint-Germain for Old Trafford.",
      "However, this deal ended up falling in Napoli's favour as McTominay has gone on to score 22 goals and provide 10 assists in 67 appearances so far.",
      "The Scotland international won Serie A in his debut campaign in Italy and added the Italian Super Cup this season with a 2-0 win over Bologna in the final.",
      "McTominay has been a star reborn for both club and country since his United exit(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "On the other hand, Ugarte has scored just two goals and assisted six times in 63 appearances for United. McTominay will come up against English opposition this week as Zola's former side Chelsea visit Napoli in Wednesday's Champions League encounter.",
      "Zola's comments ring true about McTominay's 'completeness' as a footballer, with the 29-year-old receiving praise for his performances for club and country.",
      "In November 2025, the midfielder scored a wonder bicycle kick for Scotland in the opening minutes during their crucial World Cup 2026 qualifier against Denmark. The game finished 4-2 to the Scots and McTominay was heavily credited for his international performances in getting the nation to their first World Cup since 1998.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The transfer window looks to be a quiet one at Old Trafford with the uncertainty surrounding the managerial situation, despite Carrick's impressive start. However, it hasn't stopped the rumour mill sparking a new wave of speculation at the Theatre of Dreams with the likes of Chelsea star Cole Palmer mooted.",
      "For the former Middlesbrough head coach and his squad, their focus for the remainder of the season will be on maintaining their run of form and keeping their top four challengers at bay.",
      "According to The Guardian, Manchester United are considering whether to step up their interest in Kader Meite.",

      "Elsewhere, goalkeeper Andre Onana is reportedly headed towards an Old Trafford exit having been usurped by Senne Lammens as United's number one.",

      "It was reported on Monday that having supported United as a child, Palmer is open to returning to Manchester and signing for United, despite their struggles.

      "And it wouldn't break the bank, either, after it was reported a fee of £26m will be enough to force a deal this month. United previously looked light in natural striker options during Benjamin Sesko's injury absence, and Meite could be a worthwhile project player after flourishing in Ligue 1.",

      "United likely won't be willing to match the pay package Al-Hilal may offer as they look to recruit a star of tomorrow. However, the career prospects are much greater at Old Trafford, where he could link up with fellow French speakers Leny Yoro, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo.",

      "Discussing United, during a Napoli press conference, McTominay said: \"Michael Carrick is such a great guy. I've got so much love and respect for him.",
      "\"Those two results vs Man City and Arsenal have been amazing, especially for me to watch. So I'm very, very proud of all the players and long may it continue.\"",
      "McTominay added: \"It doesn't surprise me. I wish him [Carrick] all the best. The first matches have been great. Let's hope it continues like that.\"",
      "The remarks reveal just how keenly the Scotland international monitors his former side and arrive mere days after the club were urged to pursue his return to Old Trafford by their ex-striker Giuseppe Rossi. \"It's all up to the coach,\" he said. \"I feel that's all up in the air.",
      "\"You can't really go out and start buying players if you don't know the coaching situation. I always say McTominay because he would actually be a good player for Manchester United at this moment.\"",

      "McTominay departed United during the summer of 2024, sealing a £25million move to Serie A outfit Napoli. He has subsequently flourished, receiving widespread acclaim for his displays in Italy.",

      "Michael Carrick has impressed in the Manchester United hot seat so far(Image: PA)",
      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United will have little option but to hand Michael Carrick the permanent manager's job if he wins 10 of his next 15 matches. The former United midfielder has made a strong start to his managerial stint since the club axed Ruben Amorim, clinching victories against Manchester City and Arsenal in his opening two games.",
      "The ex-Middlesbrough boss currently has a contract that expires at the end of the season, with speculation already surfacing that he might be offered the full-time role if he continues producing results. While many have been struck by United's revival under Carrick, club icon Paul Scholes has suggested officials might be wary about prolonging his appointment.",
      "It follows the club's previous choice to grant Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the permanent post after his impressive caretaker spell. However, former United shot-stopper Foster thinks Carrick would be a certainty for the position if he secures victory in at least two thirds of his remaining fixtures.",
      "His remarks followed his praise of Carrick for helping to ease the burden on his players' shoulders in recent weeks. Foster's backing also came despite him recognising worries about a repeat of the Solskjaer scenario.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"The weight of the badge is phenomenal for Manchester United, but then a new manager comes in, somebody that they know, somebody that they trust and they get on with as a friend.",

      "Whether Carrick ultimately becomes a candidate for the permanent position is yet to be determined. However, Scholes believes United will be left \"scarred\" by their previous choice concerning Solskjaer.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, the ex-United midfielder said: \"He's come into the job now and it's been that bad for a year that it couldn't really get any worse, so the pressure isn't really on you while you're interim manager.",
      "\"Once you take ‎that job full-time, at the start of the season next year, let's say, all of a sudden you've got to be winning games straightaway.",

      "Manchester United could offer the ideal transfer present to Cole Palmer, with his favoured shirt number, should he pull off a sensational switch to the club - as has been mooted in bombshell reports.",
      "The England attacking midfielder, 23, has emerged as one of the Premier League's most impressive performers over the past two campaigns, following his transfer from Manchester City to Chelsea in summer 2023. During his spell at Stamford Bridge, he has netted 48 goals and contributed a further 29 assists across 110 outings.",
      "This campaign has, nevertheless, been impacted by a persistent groin problem. Throughout the past week, stories have surfaced connecting Palmer with a remarkable switch to United. It's claimed that the England international is restless in London and is experiencing homesickness.",
      "The 23-year-old was raised as a boyhood United supporter, but progressed through the academy at rivals City. He established himself in the senior squad under Pep Guardiola during the 2021/22 campaign, before then securing his switch to Chelsea just over a year afterwards.",
      "The Blues are unlikely to surrender their prized asset without strong resistance with reports indicating Palmer is regarded as one of the 'untouchables' whom the club have no intention of offloading. That position could in turn shift, if Palmer genuinely demands a transfer away - back to Manchester or elsewhere.",
      "Should United pursue a deal, then the perfect welcoming gesture could arrive in the squad number he receives. Currently, the club's No.20 jersey is vacant for any fresh arrivals.",
      "That was the number that Palmer wore in his first two seasons at Chelsea. He now wears the No.10 jersey there, however, after switching things around before the current season.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for 10 weeks with an injury(Image: Nigel French/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has been thrown the first major curveball of his tenure as Manchester United interim head coach with the unwelcome news that Patrick Dorgu will miss 10 weeks with a hamstring injury.",
      "Dorgu has been the stand-out performer since Carrick took over from Ruben Amorim, scoring in both the 2-0 win over Manchester City and the 3-2 away win at Arsenal. Converted from a left wingback in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system to a left winger in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 formation, he has been a revelation.",
      "United will now be deprived of his services for around 10 weeks after his exertions against Arsenal saw the Denmark international pick up a hamstring injury. He is likely to miss eight Premier League games, with a potential return coming against Leeds on April 11.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Carrick does not have the luxury of using Jadon Sancho or Marcus Rashford, who are both away playing the position on loan with Aston Villa and Barcelona respectively, or Alejandro Garnacho, who was sold to Chelsea for £40million in the summer after falling out with Amorim.",
      "The most obvious replacement for Dorgu is therefore Mason Mount. The United midfielder has played off the left side as one of the attacking midfielders under Amorim's management and is comfortable cutting inside onto his stronger right foot.",
      "Mount was an unused substitute against Arsenal after replacing Bruno Fernandes in the Manchester Derby. The 27-year-old works hard and has the positional discipline that has made him liked by previous United bosses, despite a lacklustre return of seven goals and two assists in 66 appearances for the club.",
      "If Carrick did opt to start Mount in the next match against Fulham, he would likely ask more from Luke Shaw going forwards on the overlap, with Mount happiest going inside.",
      "Mason Mount is the obvious beneficiary after Patrick Dorgu's injury(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The other most likely option is to shuffle the pack up front. Carrick has played Bryan Mbeumo as a lone striker in both of his matches so far to great effect, with the Cameroon international scoring against City and Arsenal. But the impact of Matheus Cunha off the bench in both games cannot be ignored - and the Brazilian admitted he is desperate to start.",
      "Cunha scored a fabulous winner at Arsenal after coming off the bench for Mbeumo in the 69th minute, linking up with Kobbie Mainoo before curling into the bottom corner from outside the box. He is at his best in the middle of the pitch, ideally playing behind another striker, but has the ability to start on the left and drift inside onto his dangerous right foot.",
      "Matheus Cunha is pushing Michael Carrick to start him(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United do have a left-footer in their starting line-up: Amad. The Ivory Coast international prefers to play on the right side and cut inside, but could be repositioned on the opposite side to resemble a traditional winger. If that were the case, then Mbeumo could be moved back to the right, where he played under Amorim, with Cunha up front and Bruno Fernandes in the No.10 role.",
      "Amad has shown positional flexibility, having been fielded as a right wingback by Amorim. However, Carrick may not want to avoid putting too many square pegs into round holes, given his early success at United has been built around simplifying things and putting players in their strongest positions.",
      "Amad could switch wings (Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick has repeatedly spoken about his belief in the United academy, whose reputation took a beating during the Amorim era. The ex-United midfielder has close links with the young players at the club and will be well aware of Shea Lacey's talents.",
      "The 18-year-old winger has made two substitute appearances in the Premier League this season, while he was sent off in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Brighton earlier this month. Like Amad, he is more comfortable on the right wing, cutting inside onto his left, but could be handed more opportunities in the coming weeks.",

      "Mainoo's stock took a hit during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but strong performances against Manchester City and Arsenal were reminders of the wonderfully talented player United have on their hands.",
      "\"I think part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories, but I think we've seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great,\" said Carrick before Arsenal.",
      "Mainoo is posting United-related photos on his social media again. There had been a nine-month Instagram hiatus, but he's been brought back into the fold by Carrick, who has known him since he was a boy.",
      "The 20-year-old was disenchanted with life under Amorim, and he was set to push to leave on loan in the January window until the Portuguese was axed amid rising tensions with the board.",
      "It was criminal that Amorim could not find a way to fit Mainoo into his system. Amorim overlooked Mainoo in his first game against Ipswich, which set the tone. He experimented with Mainoo as a No.10 and up front. There were jokes within the squad about him playing as a striker.",
      "Amorim eventually settled on his role, deciding he would compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot in midfield. \"He is fighting for the position now with Bruno. I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal,\" said Amorim in August.",
      "\"And then when I changed it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder. So he just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.\"",
      "Mainoo was fighting a losing battle from that moment onwards, but he remained committed to winning his place back, doing extra work during the international breaks and changing his chef at home.",
      "Mainoo took another step forward against Arsenal.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Mainoo's frustration began to show by the end of Amorim's tenure, though. He liked a few ill-timed posts on social media about Amorim, and his half-brother paraded a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford. United insisted that Mainoo knew nothing about the stunt from his sibling.",
      "The frustration was understandable, given he'd gone from starting at Euro 2024 to not getting a sniff of a league start, but Mainoo had little chance when his manager pitted him against Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon. He'd only ever missed two United games due to injury until his recent hamstring issue.",
      "Amorim essentially said Mainoo would never start in the Premier League when he confirmed he was competing with Fernandes. The United captain is undroppable and kept Mainoo out of the team.",
      "Mainoo was the biggest winner from Amorim's sacking, but his departure was bound to be a negative for some others, like Mason Mount, whose relationship with Amorim was strong.",
      "Mount benefited from Amorim's formation, and United were a better team when he was in the starting line-up in the first half of the campaign. Mount delivered consistently strong performances, scoring important goals against Sunderland and Crystal Palace to finally have momentum behind him.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack. It's the quality that when he touches the ball, it's really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him,\" said Amorim last month.",
      "Writing on social media when Amorim's sacking was announced, Mount said: \"Thank you, gaffer. All the best to you and your staff for the future.\" Unsurprisingly, there was no farewell message from Mainoo.",
      "Mount and Fernandes embrace at Selhurst Park.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick has switched to 4-2-3-1 and Mainoo has slotted perfectly back into a three-man midfield, but the tactical switch now means Mount is competing with Fernandes to start as the central attacking midfielder.",
      "Mount was introduced in injury time in the Manchester derby and was an unused substitute against Arsenal. It's too early to say he won't be used as much by Carrick, but he only needs to look at Mainoo's situation from earlier in the season to know what happens when Fernandes is the competition to start.",
      "The silver lining for Mount is that he was in a similar position in the summer when Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed, setting them up as the first-choice players in Amorim's No.10 roles.",
      "Speaking in pre-season, Mount reflected: \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that.",
      "\"Obviously, with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo) are going to elevate us to another level, and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",
      "Mount backed himself and successfully found a way to force himself into the side. That may be more difficult to do against Fernandes, but he's already shown the required talent and mentality to do so. It will also help that Mount could feature on the flanks in the 4-2-3-1. It would be stupid to write him off.",

      "Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Last weekend, Leeds fans' stomachs churned when they spotted Jonathan Woodgate celebrating against Arsenal. You could say Woodgate has 'done an Alan Smith' by switching allegiances to Manchester United.",
      "\"Seeing Jonny Woodgate celebrate a scum winner like that is grim,\" posted a Leeds fan on social media. They may have to get used to Michael Carrick's backroom staff celebrating on touchlines, though.",
      "Carrick has overseen brilliant wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. United sources continue to reiterate that nobody is getting carried away, but Carrick has made a perfect start, helping to restore optimism for the remainder of the season after inheriting a team out of all cup competitions.",
      "The backroom staff have been crucial in those wins. Steve Holland joined Carrick to serve as assistant manager, while Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are first-team coaches.",
      "Holland and Woogate have been hands-on alongside Carrick during training sessions. Woodgate speaks Spanish, which has helped him find common ground with Spanish-speaking players in the squad.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Woodgate signed for Real Madrid in the summer of 2004, he attempted to speak Spanish at his initiation, while Michael Owen, who signed in the same window, chose to speak English. Woodgate immersed himself in Spanish culture and watched Spanish television to help pick up conversations more easily. He said it was \"vital\" to learn. Studying Spanish stood him in good stead when he coached Spanish players at Bournemouth, and it has helped him to endear himself at Carrington.",
      "\"Chuffed for Woody. Hope you get a chance to speak to him at some point. He’s good as gold, brilliant fella,\" was the message from a north-east contact after his arrival at United.",
      "A journalist who interviewed Woodgate during his time at Real Madrid was present in the mixed zone at the Emirates. Woodgate strolled over to have a small catch-up with that reporter.",
      "Woodgate and Zidane during Madrid training in 2004.(Image: 2004 AFP)",
      "Woodgate had the talent to be remembered as one of the finest English defenders of all time, but injuries ultimately curtailed his career. Unsurprisingly, the 46-year-old has passed on knowledge to United's defensive unit since his arrival, working individually with the defenders to help them improve.",
      "Woodgate's coaching career has been interesting. He was an assistant coach at Middlesbrough when they were relegated from the Premier League in 2017. He returned to Boro in the summer of 2019 to become their manager, but he was sacked near the end of his first season.",
      "In 2021, Woodgate joined Bournemouth. He oversaw the remainder of the campaign as interim, guiding the Cherries into the Championship play-offs, before being overlooked for the permanent job.",
      "Woodgate returned to Middlesbrough in 2022 to work as a first-team coach following Carrick's appointment as manager. He departed alongside Carrick when he was sacked by Boro. During their time at Middlesbrough, Carrick said: \"Woody has been massive ever since I’ve walked through the door. The impact on me and around the place is massive… his character, knowledge and love of the game. He sees things a little bit differently than me, having obviously played at the back.",
      "\"We feed off each other in a good, dynamic way. He’s constantly looking at different things to what I might see and helping the boys develop. Defence is one of the things we’ve really been conscious of and trying to focus on. Woody does a lot of work with the back four, and credit to him for that.\"",
      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick and Jonathan Woodgate the assistant head coach",
      "Evans, who retired from playing at the end of last season, has also been responsible for individual work with the defenders. Evans took up a role as head of loans and pathways last summer, but sources with knowledge of his decision to step away in December said it was not a position that suited him.",
      "The academy graduate is now within the thick of the action again, which is thought to be more suitable for this stage of his career, compared to the slow pace of his previous United role.",
      "Evans is hugely respected at Carrington. He is particularly good with young players, having experience of what it's like to come through the academy and what teenagers must do to consolidate.",
      "Respect for Holland is widespread in the coaching sphere. He worked with Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez and Antonio Conte, among others, during his time at Chelsea, and was credited with overseeing the bulk of coaching during his stint as Gareth Southgate's assistant manager for England.",
      "Holland is a boyhood United fan and would watch games from the Stretford End when he was a kid. Carrick had not worked with him before, but agreed with Jason Wilcox that his skillset would be helpful.",
      "Holland and Carrick pictured in discussion.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Binnion's official title at the academy was 'head of player development and coaching' before his first-team promotion. Binnion was U21 manager, but stepped up to help Darren Fletcher when he was caretaker.",
      "He was retained to coach within the senior set-up when Carrick was appointed. Binnion has long been a conduit between the first-team and the academy, advising which players are ready to participate in senior training sessions, but his role has evolved over the last few weeks. Although Binnion was on the bench during Fletcher's two games in charge, he has now moved into the stands to sit with the analysts and pass on information to the bench during matches.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece during the Manchester derby. Binnion's aerial advantage means he can feed back nuggets of information that the coaches in the dug-out may not identify. Binnion has worked tirelessly behind the scenes in the academy over the last few years. Young players, parents and representatives have all benefited from his wise counsel.",
      "Craig Mawson was the only coach on Ruben Amorim's backroom staff to be retained after his exit. Mawson joined United in 2019, having worked his way up at Burnley in different goalkeeper coach positions.",
      "The first-team analyst staff continue to be important. Amorim namedropped Kaita Hasegawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and he is understood to play an important role in the background.",
      "Carrick has been lavished with praise, however, the mini-transformation over the fortnight has been a collective effort. United are heading in the right direction again thanks to their work at Carrington.",

      "Former Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim(Image: Molly Darlington/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has only been in the building a couple of weeks but already he has built up a good chunk of credit in the bank thanks to the opening two results as Manchester United interim head coach. After the draws to Leeds and Burnley, coupled with the defeat to Brighton, the next two fixtures looked daunting.",
      "Manchester City and Arsenal are both battling it out for the Premier League title and have, for much of this season, looked considerably better than the Reds. But what a difference a new head coach can make as the form book was cast out of the window.",
      "Pep Guardiola's City were made to look ordinary by United and even with their injury concerns, that is no small feat.",
      "But perhaps more impressively, Carrick's men travelled to Arsenal on Sunday and managed to end their unbeaten home form this season and put a dent in their title charge too.",
      "While the Reds continue to pick up results, no player can knock on the interim head coach's door and demand more game time. Carrick has introduced a 4-2-3-1 system which largely suits the players at his disposal but has meant some now have different roles.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "For instance, Bruno Fernandes has been reintroduced to the attacking midfield role in the 4-2-3-1, which was an obvious decision to make. Under Ruben Amorim, the Portuguese captain was dropped deeper to allow both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to play as No.10s.",
      "This pushed Kobbie Mainoo out to the peripheries of the United squad and even led him to request a loan move in the summer as he foresaw his minutes being cut. Now Mainoo has been welcomed back into the fold as a holding midfielder and one of Amorim's favourites is now having to deal with a fresh challenge to his position.",
      "Mason Mount's time at United has been plagued by injuries but it felt like he was starting a renaissance at Old Trafford under Amorim. Between November and Christmas, Mount became integral as he benefitted from Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) call-ups and the use of two No.10s in Amorim's system.",
      "He scored two goals in this period, including the winner against Crystal Palace. But after picking up his knock on Boxing Day, Mount has since found his minutes cut again.",
      "Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes embrace after the former scored against Crystal Palace",
      "In three Premier League matches since Amorim left, he has not started and played a total of 30 minutes from the bench. Against Arsenal, he was an unused substitute.",
      "Like Mainoo discovered, Fernandes is undroppable in this team and while Mbeumo can be adapted to the centre-forward role, Mount knows he is battling with the Portuguese for that spot in the starting XI. He is not alone though, Cunha has also found starts hard to come by.",
      "However, he has been called upon more often by Carrick and in the two opening matches of the interim head coach's era, he has secured an assist against City and a winner vs Arsenal. If Carrick wants to freshen things up and change the direction of the game, it is Cunha who will be called upon before Mount so patience will be key for the former Chelsea man.",
      "Mount will take solace from the fact it remains early days and he will still be part of the plans, even if his minutes diminish somewhat. But for now, one of Amorim's favourites is having to make do with a spot on the bench.",

      "Patrick Dorgu pulled up against Arsenal(Image: PA)",
      "Patrick Dorgu could be ruled out with a hamstring injury after being substituted against Arsenal last weekend. Dorgu scored a superb goal in Manchester United's win at the Emirates, but was replaced with nine minutes remaining after going down with an injury.",
      "Michael Carrick suggested Dorgu was brought off with cramp, but the 21-year-old appeared to hold his hamstring when he went down, and subsequently limped away from the stadium. When asked how the injury was as he departed, Dorgu responded: \"We'll see.\"",
      "Dorgu's injury is being assessed and United sources have insisted no timescale for his lay-off is clear at this stage, despite reports claiming he could be sidelined for around 10 weeks.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu played on the right wing against Newcastle on Boxing Day and scored the matchwinner. He built on that performance by scoring against Manchester City from the wing again.",
      "The Denmark international retained his starting role to face Arsenal at the Emirates, and he scored a stunning half-volley to fire United into a 2-1 lead in the second half of the game.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Carrick said: “Pat’s been a big player for us, obviously he’s scored two goals but in terms of the threat and athleticism and quality, he’s been immense down the side with Luke [Shaw] against two teams that ask a lot of questions.",
      "“I am delighted for him because the two goals he’s scored are very different goals. It's nice to see him smiling and happy. He obviously came off with, hopefully, a little bit of cramp, hopefully, it's nothing worse.",
      "“At this stage, it's hard to tell, so we'll just have to wait and see. Hopefully it's not too bad.”",
      "The MEN revealed this week that Dorgu \"does loads of extras\" in training, with a source crediting him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crossing, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The defender knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed three goals and two assists in seven games, representing his hottest run of form since his arrival from Lecce.",

      "Away from the first-team, there's some lunchtime action for United's next generation. One or two familiar names in the mix, not least a certain Kai Rooney on the bench;",
      "Former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was tipped for an Old Trafford comeback as interim manager, only to miss out to Michael Carrick. Now, as Carrick celebrates back-to-back wins, Solskjaer faces a different challenge entirely.",
      "United's managerial choice has already paid dividends, with Carrick securing Premier League victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. Solskjaer has remained unemployed since departing Besiktas earlier this campaign but will be monitoring one of his former club's Premier League rivals very closely this week.",
      "The Norwegian is a UEFA technical observer for the Champions League this season, one of more than 20 footballing figures to hold the responsibility. His role will bring him back to England this week, with Solskjaer set to attend Liverpool's home fixture against Qarabag in a professional capacity.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Manchester United could reportedly be set to shell out £26million (€30m) to secure the signature of Stade Rennais striker Mohamed Kader Meite in the January transfer window, according to French media reports.",
      "At just 18 years old, Meite has quickly become one of the most sought-after talents in European football following his breakout season in Ligue 1. The young forward has netted three goals in 19 appearances across all competitions this term, building on a record of 14 goals in 32 matches at youth level.",
      "French publication Quest-France has reported that United have shown interest in the teenage sensation. This news follows earlier reports from Foot Mercato suggesting that United are planning to thwart Al-Hilal's bid to sign the France Under-21 international.",

      "Juve are reportedly growing desperate in their hunt for a new striker, with Dusan Vlahovic out injured. The Old Lady had been keen on a move for Jean Philippe Mateta, but Nottingham Forest look to be in pole position.",
      "The Italian club saw a move for Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri collapse and attention has turned to Zirkzee.",

      "Dorgu's injury is being assessed and United sources have insisted no timescale for his lay-off is clear at this stage, despite reports claiming he could be sidelined for around 10 weeks.",

      "Despite beating Manchester City and Arsenal, speculation has fuelled suggestions that he could become the permanent head coach. After claiming United will be 'scarred' by their previous experience of giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the job on the back of an interim spell, Scholes then suggested he could return to Tottenham.",

      "Manchester United supporters are currently waiting anxiously to discover if Patrick Dorgu's injury is serious or not ahead of the clash with Fulham on Sunday. The Dane has been a revelation for Michael Carrick having been moved up field in the 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by the interim head coach.",
      "“Pat’s been a big player for us, obviously he’s scored two goals but in terms of the threat and athleticism and quality, he’s been immense,\" declared Carrick after Dorgu had put Arsenal to the sword on Sunday. In Carrick's first two matches in charge, Dorgu has scored in both including a screamer at the Emirates and the goal that sealed victory over City.",
      "However, before Matheus Cunha's winner, Dorgu was substituted with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Immediately after the game, Carrick suggested the injury was merely cramp and he would be assessed.",
      "On Tuesday, reports suggested Dorgu would be out for ten weeks with a hamstring concern. It is understood by MEN Sport that Dorgu is still being assessed and no timeline for his injury has yet been confirmed. But should he be out for one game or an extended period, United will need to replace him.",
      "So with this in mind, we have taken a look at three ways United could choose to line up without Dorgu for however long he is out for.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The first choice for United and probably the most likely option would be to recall Cunha to the starting XI. Carrick has been using the Brazilian as his first choice substitution in recent matches and he has been repaying that faith.",
      "His goal cutting in from the left flank on Sunday was a stroke of genius and will have stood him in good stead to get a start against Fulham at the weekend if Dorgu is injured. Cunha's involvement would weaken the bench but that is a price United will more than likely have to pay.",
      "Manchester United XI with Matheus Cunha replacing Patrick Dorgu",
      "Another option available to Carrick would be to recall Mason Mount to the starting XI. This would be an unorthodox move for the Reds considering Mount is more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "However, the former Chelsea man has experience playing across the attacking midfield three and may need to show greater flexibility if he is to get more minutes in the starting line-up. Now Bruno Fernandes has been moved back to attacking midfield, Mount will find it difficult to unseat him - just as Kobbie Mainoo did.",
      "Therefore, playing him on the left could be an opportunity for him to stake his claim again.",
      "Manchester United XI with Mason Mount replacing Patrick Dorgu",
      "United are not blessed with many left wingers but even so, this seems an unlikely wildcard option. Teenager Shea Lacey is more suited to playing on the right but has featured on the left flank previously in emergencies.",
      "The 18-year-old was sent off for a quick second yellow offence in his last appearance for United but he need not worry about that affecting his chances in the first team. Carrick has made it his mission to show support for the academy players and recently attended their FA Youth Cup fixture vs Derby County.",
      "That being said, thrusting Lacey into a position he is not fully comfortable with while Dorgu is out would be a major curveball.",

The new Chelsea head coach maintains that Palmer is 'untouchable' and will not be departing Stamford Bridge in the foreseeable future.",
      "The midfielder signed a seven-year contract with the Blues in September 2023, including a club option for an additional year. Shortly after departing his native Wythenshawe in south Manchester for west London, Palmer received his first call-up to the England squad, having established himself as a Premier League star at Chelsea.",
      "But reports emerged on Monday suggesting that Palmer, a boyhood United supporter, would be receptive to a return to Manchester and a switch to United, despite their current difficulties. The 23-year-old was said to be willing to entertain approaches from Old Trafford, having allegedly grown unsettled in London, where he has spent the last two and a half years following his £42.5million departure from Manchester City.",
      "However, Rosenior delivered a forthright response before Chelsea's Champions League fixture away to Napoli on Wednesday. When questioned whether Palmer was 'untouchable' and 'happy', Rosenior answered: \"Yes and yes.",

      "It is well-documented that Palmer is a childhood United fan - something which could prove incredibly important down the line if a move begins to formulate.

      "Now, 12 years ago, there was another United fan playing for Chelsea - Spaniard Juan Mata. The classy midfielder won the World Cup with Spain in 2010 and after impressing at Valencia with the likes of David Villa and David Silva, he earned a move to the Premier League with Chelsea.",
      "Despite winning the Player of the Year in his first two seasons, he didn't hold down his place in the third campaign and despite being okay with staying at the club, when United came calling he couldn't turn them down.",

      "He continued: \"When Manchester United called and they said ‘We’re going to go for you and make an offer to Chelsea, we want you to come’, I spoke with them. I really wanted to go and really wanted to feel what it is to be a Manchester United player.\"I had suffered playing against United with Chelsea and they are definitely one of the biggest clubs in the world. At that moment, they were struggling with the first season of [David] Moyes and were not doing great in the league, but that doesn’t matter. I wanted to come to be a player for this club.\"",
      "When he left the club in 2022, he would post on social media: \"Sometimes reality exceeds dreams. Thank you, Manchester United.\"",
      "United would've known Mata was a big fan of the club from when negotiations began, so the lure of joining his dream club would've made the process a lot smoother.",
      "Now, with Palmer, United could look to exploit the same loyalties and get Palmer on board at the club. The Sun are reporting that Palmer is unhappy in London and a return to his homeland may be on the cards, although a return to City is not happening.",
      "At 23, Palmer is the type of player that United could build their team around. He's a catalyst in the number 10 role and the heartbeat of the Chelsea team when playing.

      "Michael Carrick has handled Matheus Cunha superbly so far",
      "The pent-up frustration and disappointment that Matheus Cunha felt at finding his place in the Manchester United team under threat for the first time came pouring out during his celebration at the Emirates. The Brazilian celebrated wildly with the away end before directing his anger down a camera lens.",
      "It's been a strange week or so for the 26-year-old Brazilian, who has found himself on the bench for successive Premier League games for the first time since his move from Wolves in the summer, but has also managed to deliver two decisive moments.",
      "Cunha came on for the final 19 minutes against Manchester City last week and produced a lively cameo. His clever runs offered an outlet to United and he created the goal with which Patrick Dorgu killed the game off.",
      "That wasn't enough to get him back in the team at Arsenal. This time, he got the final 21 minutes and again looked up for the fight. His contribution was even bigger, striding forward and curling a stunning goal into the corner of David Raya's net to earn United a famous victory.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Cunha has taken his goal contributions to seven in 22 games with his efforts over the past week, and once again, it looks like his Old Trafford career is threatening to kick into gear. Despite being signed as a perfect fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, he only showed glimpses under the Portuguese head coach, and his best performances have come as a false nine.",
      "Speaking after the win at the Emirates, Michael Carrick massaged Cunha's ego, showering him with praise for the contribution he has made despite not starting either of his first two games in charge.",
      "\"Matheus coming on, a big impact again like he did last week,\" said Carrick. \"Creating a goal last week. I just fancied him to score when the ball came out of his feet.",
      "\"He kind of epitomises what we've been like this week. Matheus has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact. He's been disappointed not to start but he's used it in a really good way.",
      "\"Two huge moments and he totally deserves that winning goal for how he's applied himself, and I’m absolutely delighted.\"",
      "Carrick has made a bold call with leaving the £62.5million signing out so far, especially for Dorgu. As well as the young Dane has done, on stature and squad status, the safe decision would have been to start the big-money summer signing.",
      "These decisions are even harder for Carrick because of the lack of games to use his squad, which is now only missing Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. In a normal season for United, Cunha could have started in Europe in midweek, but that isn't an option.",
      "There are only 15 games left this season and by the time of the Fulham game this weekend, Cunha will have played a little over 40 minutes in three weeks. That makes the challenge not only of rotation but also of keeping players happy all the more difficult for Carrick.",
      "So far, he has got it right with the Brazilian. Cunha has earned a start, although the problem is nobody deserves to be dropped either. Perhaps Dorgu's injury and the different game plan required to take on Fulham at Old Trafford will open a door.",
      "It certainly feels like Carrick needs to give him that. If he has kept him on side so far and managed to get him to channel his disappointment in the right way, that can quickly change if positive impacts off the bench only lead to more time on the bench.",
      "Cunha is doing the right things at Carrington. Like the rest of the squad, he has embraced the shorter, sharper sessions at Carrington and his form looks to be trending in the right direction again. He has done everything Carrick has asked of him in the past two weeks, and now it is time for that to be rewarded.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "Carrick attended an Under-21 game at Leigh Sports Village last Tuesday and showed further support for the Under-18s at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup. He was joined by his staff and both occasions.",
      "Ruben Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Rooney sat alongside Carrick in the directors' box at Old Trafford to watch the U18s because his son, Kai, made an appearance from the bench. And United's all-time top goalscorer believes it's important to have first-team representation at academy fixtures to show support to youngsters.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Rooney said: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy, which is important for that football club. I have a different focus watching my son.",
      "\"Potentially in the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest. t was great to see them all.",
      "\"He [Kai] has upped the age group to play in the Youth Cup. He helped them get the win. It was a proud moment for me. Even on Saturday, they were all [first-team staff] at the Under-16 game as well before they travelled to London [to face Arsenal]. It has been missing. I have been quite vocal on this.",
      "\"It has been missing in the last few years. It is great to see that coming back into the club. When we had a Sunday game, after training, we used to finish training and go and watch the academy games.",
      "\"That was the norm. That is what I have known at Manchester United. With my two lads in the academy, I haven’t seen that. It was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players, and the players’ parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.\"",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could change his manager's mind and earn a starting role, Amorim, without any prompting, said: \"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Toby Collyer in the press conference, saying: \"He’s from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead just before the half-hour mark when Lisandro Martinez put the ball through his own net, but Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a horror backpass by Martin Zubimendi to draw his side level before the break.",
      "Patrick Dorgu then fired United ahead, but Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for the Gunners when he bundled the ball home from close-range.",
      "But Matheus Cunha had other ideas, as his stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. Following the game, Carrick held talks with Ratcliffe, but when put on the spot about what was discussed, he gave very little away except revealing his boss was a very happy man.",
      "“No, not much as you would expect, I think,” he told Viaplay. “There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",

Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Solskjaer and Carrick contended for the interim job this season.(Image: 2021 Alex Livesey - Danehouse)",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he has spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating him to the Manchester United interim job. Carrick, Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered to take charge of United for the remainder of the campaign, but Carrick landed the role.",
      "United sources described Carrick as 'impressive' throughout the interview process, and he made a dream start to his interim role by overseeing a stunning victory against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas in August. The Norwegian was responsible for Besiktas crashing out of Europe and was axed after just seven months in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick got a first taste of coaching as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and he was retained when Solskjaer took over. Carrick has remained in touch with Solskjaer since working with him during that spell.",
      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",
      "Carrick after beating Arsenal in November 2021.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I think the confidence I'm taking going into the game is what we've seen since I've been here between me and my staff in terms of the game itself, training, how the boys have gone about it. Games from three or four years ago. It's done. It's in the past,\" he said.",
      "\"So as much as the experience kind of helps you in certain moments, I think it's a totally different game on Sunday and two teams going into it, looking forward to it in good shape.\"",
      "Speaking about United's game plan at the Emirates on Sunday, Carrick said: \"I think it's just playing to what we feel the game needs, really.",
      "\"It's never the same. Even if you come in half time and you've had a good performance for 45 minutes, I'm never one that likes to say same again because it's never, ever the same again. You've got to build on it. So it won't be kind of copy and paste.",
      "\"I think there's new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, we need to be at our best. And if we are our best and we're there, we feel we've got a good chance.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "That has seen the Man City academy graduate linked with top clubs around Europe and over the last week there has been speculation that he could move to Man Utd.",
      "Reports have claimed that he is ‘unsettled’ at Stamford Bridge and would like to move back to the North West, although a move back to Man City has been ruled out unless Pep Guardiola leaves.",

      "When asked if Chelsea would need to qualify for the Champions League to keep Palmer, Murphy told BestBettingSites: “No, because they’ve got him under a long-term contract, so they can keep him either way.",
      "“But qualifying for the Champions League would make it much easier to quieten the noise around other clubs trying to get him.",
      "“It would definitely help. This season hasn’t been as fruitful as he’d like because of injuries and getting back to form. He’s had this nagging thigh or groin problem, whatever it is.",

      "Rosenior added: “I’m not surprised at the timing. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there’s people unsettled. It’s not true. Cole’s here, he’s very happy and I can’t wait to see him back on the pitch.”",

      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt has revealed that he “feels sorry” for Matheus Cunha after he came off the bench to score the winner against Arsenal in a 3-2 victory.",
      "The Red Devils came from a goal down to lead 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday before Mikel Merino levelled the scores up with only six minutes left on the clock.",
      "However, just three minutes later, Man Utd substitute Cunha picked up the ball and dribbled to the edge of the box before unleashing an unstoppable winner past David Raya.",
      "Cunha, who joined Man Utd from Wolves in a £62.5m deal in the summer, has contributed five goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances this season.",
      "The Brazilian also started as a substitute against Man City the week before and both Butt and Paul Scholes insist that Cunha will not be happy about his role, although Patrick Dorgu’s injury is likely to mean he starts their next match against Fulham.",
      "Speaking about Dorgu’s impact under interim boss Michael Carrick, Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast: “He was brought in as a wing-back because that was Amorim’s system, but going back to when we were playing, wide players actually would help your full-back, and United have started doing that.",
      "READ: Odegaard binned by Arsenal as Man Utd duo leave in summer exodus of 10 POTY winners",
      "“Against Saka, who is their best attacker by a million miles, it was like playing against two left-backs at times because he was working back, but he’s scoring goals as well.",
      "“I don’t see him there as a left winger full-time, Michael’s obviously seen something in him that he likes because he’s left Cunha out for him, and what a player he is.”",
      "Butt interrupted: “Cunha’s giving you an option off the bench and I do feel a bit sorry.”",
      "Before Scholes added: “He won’t be happy with that, no chance, he won’t be happy with that sentence.”",
      "And  Butt continued: “If you look when Darren [Fletcher] was in charge and he’s looking at his bench, he’s got no one to come on. You’ve got the young lads which is okay, they’re good players but when it’s going bad you need proper pros in that team who can come on the pitch, stick their chest out and go against people.",
      "“He might find himself in a bad position now, Cunha, thinking, ‘I’m a really good sub to bring on, I carry the ball up the pitch, I get the fouls, kill the clock when we’re winning and I can score goals’, he could end up being a super sub.",
      "“Also with the Cunha situation, I think Mbeumo has been brilliant as a nine. I think he’s done that job really, really well. He’s a handful, he’s powerful, he’s quick, you’re thinking Cunha might see himself on the bench for a good few weeks now.”",
      "Self-proclaimed “above average” Premier League footballer Jamie O’Hara would be a shoo-in for Prick of the Week if we still gave out that award…",

      "The lack of a natural option on the left has seen Mason Mount play in Ruben Amorim’s front three for much of this campaign, while natural left-wing-back Patrick Dorgu has been deployed as a left winger under interim manager Darren Fletcher and current boss Michael Carrick.",

      "Champions League qualification would provide a significant boost towards landing their top transfer targets, with midfielders Carlos Baleba of Brighton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton all reportedly of interest.",

      "The report states:",
      "The left winger market is going to be one to pay closer attention to in the coming months with United likely to stick to a back-four system regardless of whether Carrick remains in charge or not.",
      "Sources in Italy have said that AC Milan would consider a sale for Rafael Leao, while Ineos’ Premier League-proven preference brings others such as Tyrique George, 19, and available to leave Chelsea, and Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye, under contract until 2029, into consideration.",
      "Leao has been perpetually linked with a Premier League move for several years, reportedly previously being a top target for Chelsea.",

      "He is widely regarded as one of the best wingers in Europe but has yet to be tested in the Premier League, which could make the signing of Ndiaye more appealing.",

      "The 25-year-old has four goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, but his impact goes beyond statistics. Excellent in one-on-one situations with opposition full-backs, Ndiaye is among Europe’s best dribblers and has the ability to turn defence into attack in the blink of an eye.",

      "A player with immense ability and potential, the 19-year-old has struggled for minutes this campaign and was close to joining Fulham last summer.

      "The Brazilian legend confirmed on social media: “Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever. Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.”",
      "Casemiro has been strongly linked with a move from Manchester United to Saudi Arabia since the 2023/24 campaign, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "The 33-year-old looked finished at the top level towards the end of Erik ten Hag’s time at the club, but became an unlikely success story under recently departed head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "He thrived in Amorim’s much-maligned 3-4-3 system alongside Bruno Fernandes and is set to leave United on a high when his contract expires this summer.",
      "Now that Casemiro will be available on a free transfer, he is expected to head to the Saudi Pro League for one final lucrative contract.",
      "According to former Red Devils chief scout Mick Brown, who remains well connected in the game, it is all but guaranteed that Casemiro will move to the Middle East in the summer transfer window.",
      "“Casemiro is almost certainly going to Saudi Arabia,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "“He’ll be 34 at the end of the season, and the opportunity is there for him to go and make a hell of a lot of money over there and see out the rest of his career.",
      "“The interest has been there for a while and his contract is running out so he can speak to anybody he likes about a move at the end of the season.",
      "“I expect it will be agreed before the season ends and especially now they’ve announced his exit.”",
      "Brown added that United’s timing risked unnecessary speculation.",
      "“I’m not sure why they decided now would be the right time, when he’s still playing a key role in the team, because it’s only going to lead to speculation.",
      "“If he has a bad game now, all the talk will be about ‘is his head elsewhere?’ and along those lines, so it creates a situation and opens the door for criticism.",
      "“I’m told they came to a private agreement a while ago that he would be leaving, whatever the reasons may be for that, but they didn’t have to make it public.”",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed when Casemiro’s exit from Manchester United was decided, while David Ornstein believes he has an advantage over other managers.",

      "Casemiro confirms he will leave Manchester United as a free agent this summer. The Brazilian wrote an emotional goodbye on social media.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick has opted to ‘reject’ a transfer involving England international Harry Maguire.",

      "“I would fully expect that to be the result with Elliot Anderson as well. They would prefer to give him a big wage rise and see him play at Nottingham Forest rather than lose him.”",
      "Former Forest striker Marlon Harewood also told GOAL that he believes Anderson is worth the reported £100million fee the club want for him.",
      "Asked about a potential nine-figure transfer fee, Harewood said: “He is definitely one of those players.",
      "“If someone put that price tag on him, with the money that’s been in the game over the last couple of years, he is definitely worth it. I think he will go on and do really well at whatever club he is at.",

      "And how does Ayden Heaven feel now about the Jason Wilcox big sell?",
      "",
      "Mediawatch is old enough to remember the Daily Telegraph stopping just short of their mystery Manchester United ‘source’ describing Jason Wilcox as a very selfless but powerful lover so we are unsurprised to see James Ducker leading the ‘haven’t Manchester United done some excellent transfer business, after all?’ charge.",
      "Wilcox Ducker reports that Wilcox ‘copped a lot of unfair criticism in the wake of Amorim’s sacking’, before noting that ‘last Sunday at the Emirates Stadium, five of the club’s six signings in 2025 played key roles in consigning Premier League leaders Arsenal to their first home defeat of the campaign’.",
      "That’s one hell of a spin on Benjamin Sesko’s three whole touches from the bench, one of which was the ball smashing him in the face from close range.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About so…",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s introduction for Dorgu, with United leading 2-1 and Carrick sending the signal to push for a third goal, was the kind of positive, attack-minded substitution in keeping with the club’s history and not witnessed enough under Amorim.",
      "Which makes him definitely worth £73.7m.",
      "United had also looked at Gyokeres – who had excelled under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon – but they were unsure how much more there was to come from the 27-year-old. By contrast, they felt Sesko – still only 22 – had a higher ceiling and his best years ahead and they eventually beat Newcastle United to sign him for £73.7m from RB Leipzig. As one source put it: “There are some No 9s that big clubs have signed where you’re wondering how much they have left in the tank.”",
      "Yes, thank f*** they didn’t waste money on that past-it Victor Osimhen (27). Dodged a bullet there. Far, far better to sign a 22-year-old to score four Premier League goals and then sit on the bench.",
      "If there was any doubt that Wilcox’s hands are all over this puff piece…",
      "When Wilcox discovered (Ayden) Heaven had met with Eintracht Frankfurt during the winter transfer window, United’s director of football arranged for the teenager to visit Old Trafford for the Europa League tie against Rangers.",
      "He watched the game from the directors’ box, was greeted by Ferguson and met with Amorim but it was Wilcox’s persuasive pitch about the pathway for the young defender that proved decisive in Heaven rejecting more lucrative offers from Premier League rivals to join United.",
      "Thanks to the Athletic, we have insight into that particular conversation; they reported (at length, obvs) last June: ‘Wilcox persuaded Heaven that if he joined United he would settle quickly into an environment well-suited to him and his ambitions, under a coach committed to playing a back three made up of defenders who are brave in possession, at a club with a long history of developing young talent.’",
      "How’s that working out, fellas?",

      "That is literally how transfers work. Bolton Wanderers are also only one transfer away from a sensational Cole Palmer deal.",
      "But it turns out that the Star actually believe that the ‘one transfer’ that is key to Cole Palmer joining Manchester United is not actually Cole Palmer joining Manchester United. Which immediately makes us think that Man Utd might actually be two transfers away.",
      "Should Fernandes opt to extend his tenure, it raises questions about Palmer’s role in the team. Although Palmer displays versatility in taking up wider roles – particularly on the right – his main prowess lies in the central position.",
      "Therefore, securing Palmer would primarily rely on whether Fernandes is enticed by an attractive deal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Nope. It would rely on Manchester United making a bid, Chelsea accepting that bid, and then Palmer agreeing to move.",

      "But there is still uncertainty over how United will approach the next transfer window due to the current managerial situation. Michael Carrick is in interim charge, but it is not yet clear whether he will remain in the role beyond the end of the season or if the club opts for a higher-profile appointment.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Despite the managerial situation, the internal admiration for Ndiaye is unlikely to go away and he will be a player to keep a close eye on in the summer.",
      "Barring any injury, he will be part of Senegal’s squad for the World Cup and if he performs well there then interest could ramp up further.",
      "A number of other clubs are understood to be tracking Ndiaye, both in the Premier League and abroad. Everton rejected a bid of £40million from Inter Milan last summer, and that is an indication of how highly the Toffees value him, which is no surprise given his contributions.",
      "Ndiaye is contracted until 2029, which puts Everton in a strong negotiating position. They have the backing of their owners, The Friedkin Group, who are prepared to spend in the summer market.",
      "With this in mind, United would need to stump up a big fee to lure Ndiaye away from Everton. No price tag has been set, as Everton insist he is not for sale, so it would take a lot for David Moyes’ side to change their minds.",
      "Everton’s record sale stands at the £75m United spent on Romelu Lukaku in July 2017 and any move would likely need to come close to matching that if they are to get the Toffees to the table.",
      "However, there is an expectation that United will operate with significant financial backing in the summer, particularly if they secure qualification for the Champions League.",
      "Ndiaye is a player to keep a close eye on, but for now, he is focused on playing well and helping Everton push for the European qualification places themselves.",

      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Gary Neville also believes that Carrick is not the long-term solution for Man United and believes they should target more experienced managers like Thomas Tuchel or Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "\"They played properly, with intensity. I think it's right that Carrick keeps the job until the end of the season and then hands the baton over to a Tuchel or an Ancelotti, someone of that world-class ilk.\"",
      "Despite the strong form in the early days of his reign since being appointed as Ruben Amorim's successor, albeit only until the end of the season, Carrick is not getting carried away.",
      "\"We couldn't expect to come here and suddenly dominate the whole game and the ball. We're just starting off, really. It's a great starting point, but we need to put more layers on top, and we'll try to do that in the coming weeks.",
      "\"I give a lot of credit to the staff and the players for how much they've invested and how much they've bought into it.",
      "\"It's alright trying to help them and say certain things, but they've got to live it - and you've seen that with the boys coming off the bench and making a difference.",
      "\"It's a real collective feeling. It's great when it comes together and everyone's in it, and we can celebrate with the fans at the end. That's important and it's a big moment.\"",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 17:29, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",

      "Matheus Cunha scored a sensational 87th-minute winner to clinch a 3-2 victory for Michael Carrick's Manchester United and cut Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League to four points.",
      "Substitute Cunha curled a stunning finish into the corner from 25 yards out, only three minutes after Mikel Merino had hauled the lacklustre hosts level from a Bukayo Saka corner.",
      "Earlier, Arsenal had squandered a lead when Martin Zubimendi's poor pass allowed Bryan Mbeumo to run through on goal and beat David Raya after Lisandro Martinez had diverted Martin Odegaard's cross-shot into his own net for the opening goal.",
      "Arsenal struggled to regain their composure after Mbeumo's leveller and Manchester United, 2-0 winners over Manchester City in Carrick's first game in charge last weekend, went in front when Patrick Dorgu crashed a superb effort in off the bar.",

      "Mikel Arteta tried to change the flow of the game by making a quadruple substitution before the hour mark, but Arsenal continued to flounder before finally restoring parity when Merino prodded over the line for yet another set-piece goal.",
      "At that point, it seemed Arsenal might go on and find a winner, but Cunha silenced the Emirates Stadium when his stunning, long-range effort sparked more wild Manchester United celebrations. There were boos from some home fans at the final whistle.",
      "The victory continues a dream start in the dugout for head coach Carrick, and leaves alarm bells ringing for Arsenal, whose lead at the top of the Premier League is reduced from seven to four points following Manchester City and Aston Villa's wins.",
      "Having been held to goalless draws against Nottingham Forest and Liverpool in their previous two Premier League games, Arsenal are now without a win in three as Manchester United continue to push for a Champions League finish in fourth.",

      "\"In the first half, we were the better team, scored the goal and had control of the game but we had a lot of giveaways in the game that created dangerous moments and in the second half the game changed a little bit.",
      "\"We know the quality they have when they get the space to run. In the second half, there were a lot of duels they won that gave them the momentum of the game and let them run and we never really managed to get into that rhythm of creating chances.",

      "\"The boys had to put an awful lot in today. It probably didn't come as easy as it did last week. Last week, the time, the flow of the game and the momentum was with us pretty much throughout, whereas today we had to dig deep.",

      "\"It's absolutely massive. We know the first game under Michael Carrick was the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. You always get up for those games and results like that can happen. But we knew we had to back it up today.",
      "\"We spoke about it before the game, coming here to face the league leaders, who have been excellent this season. They ask a lot of questions of you, and to go and get the winner after a late setback shows the character of this team. It was a magnificent performance.\"",
