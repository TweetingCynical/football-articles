      "Grimsby boss David Artell believes overcoming Brentford will be a tougher task than their Manchester United giant killing in the Carabao Cup - insisting the Bees' principles are far more deep rooted than at the Red Devils.",
      "The League Two outfit enjoyed one of the greatest nights in their history when they stunned the Premier League giants back in August. They led 2-0 at Blundell Park before being pegged back, but completed the job following a lengthy penalty shootout.",
      "Grimsby remain the lowest ranked side still in the tournament, beating Sheffield Wednesday in the third round, and are now just one game from the quarter-finals. Brentford stand between them and that stage but the west Londoners are fresh off beating Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "Last month they also got the better of Ruben Amorim's side and Artell insists they will pose the toughest test yet. Keith Andrews was hired internally to replace Thomas Frank when he left for Tottenham and the Grimsby boss believes their continued identity makes them a tougher outfit.",
      "He said: “I don’t want loads of letters from Manchester United fans from Kenya or Norway - or Stretford - but I think they’re still in that process of finding their way again.Brentford are fully in, fully understanding. That makes it so much more difficult. I think everyone agrees that Man United are still - maybe not in transition per se - but finding their way under a new manager that needs to be given time.",
      "“I think you can see the fruits of the green shoots of progress from their side, but Brentford are not that team. Brentford are a well-established team. They’ve appointed from within to continue the work that the previous manager [Thomas Frank] did, and I think everyone would suggest that Keith Andrews is doing a brilliant job and he’s taking them on.",
      "“You don’t beat West Ham so comprehensively, you don’t beat the reigning [Premier League] champions [Liverpool] if you haven’t got those principles of play already ingrained. Whether it’s set pieces, whether it’s transitions, whether it’s in possession, whether they come and get you out of possession, all that is already really well implemented into the squad. I’m not sure that was the case with Man United.”",
      "Grimsby have outlined their plan to go after Brentford with their head coach maintaining they will not sit in hoping to force the lottery of penalties. \"We’re not playing for penalties. We didn’t do that against United. We went and got them and they didn’t expect it,\" he said.",
      "Andrews has hinted at changes to the Brentford team as the games come thick and fast but wouldn't be taking the fourth tier outfit likely as he claimed they are \"very respectful around them and the qualities they have\".",
      "Grimsby sit sixth in League Two but have lost three of their last four in all competitions having been beaten by Crewe at the weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could turn their attention to Nottingham Forest ace Elliot Anderson as they look to add a central midfielder to their squad - but the England star could cost as much as £120million.",
      "The Red Devils were keen on adding more quality in the middle of the park back in the summer but ultimately ran out of cash, putting it on the back burner. Carlos Baleba emerged as a target following his stellar efforts with Brighton.",
      "A move was always deemed unrealistic and the player remained at the Amex, but United have a number of midfielders they are tracking with Anderson among them. Newcastle are also keen on the midfielder, who came through their academy before he was sold for PSR reasons.",
      "Anderson has since thrived at the City Ground, becoming one of their top performers. He was part of the triumphant England U21 side at the summer's Euros and has been named in several senior squads with World Cup involvement on the horizon.",
      "Sky in Germany report that Anderson has no release clause, putting Forest in a strong negotiating position. They want somewhere between £100m-£120m if they are to sell their midfielder. That would be a club-record fee for either United or Newcastle.",
      "Anderson only cost Forest £35m but at 22 has his prime years ahead of him. He would also help fill the homegrown quota, making him a more attractive proposition. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has confessed that his exit still irks him and he'd welcome him back with open arms.",
      "The midfielder's value could further skyrocket if he excels at the World Cup across North America next summer. Ruben Amorim is currently playing with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his preferred midfield duo, but pundits believe both players have flaws in that position.",
      "Fernandes is having to play in a deeper role, limiting how much influence he can have in the final third. Casemiro is now into his 30s and, despite some impressive weeks, critics have claimed he lacks the stamina to get round the pitch effectively.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is a clear admirer of Anderson having given him England opportunities and recently lauded the qualities possessed by the Forest ace.",
      "“He’s just a very, very good football player,\" he said. \"He has the physicality, he’s very mobile at No 6. He has the body, he loves to defend, he loves to put his body inside to duels. He loves passing, he loves to break the lines, he’s very mobile in this game. It was a pleasure to see.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe showed he can swallow his pride when admitting there were \"errors\" made at Manchester United regarding the handling of Erik ten Hag's dismissal. Tuesday marks the first anniversary of Ten Hag being sacked at Old Trafford, not long before Ruben Amorim took over as his successor.",
      "United co-owner Ratcliffe fired Ten Hag in October 2024, just a few months after the Dutchman was handed a new deal. The Red Devils rewarded their former chief after he surprised Manchester City to lift the FA Cup, believing that the victory would signal the start of a revival.",
      "It wasn't to be, however, and Ten Hag was shown the door with United sitting 14th in the Premier League at the time. And it wasn't long after that Dan Ashworth was also relieved of his duties as sporting director only a few months into the role.",
      "There's no telling where United might be had they decided to cut ties with Ten Hag in the summer of 2024 rather than grant him a stay of execution. However, Ratcliffe has already conceded it was a mistake in his judgment to grant a reprieve.",
      "\"Those decisions [delaying Ten Hag's dismissal and hiring Ashworth] were errors,\" he said in March 2025. \"There were some mitigating circumstances, but they were errors. I accept that and apologise.",
      "\"It wasn’t just the FA Cup final. The fans were of the view that we’d like to stick with him. With Erik, there was an emotional response. We get criticised for being unemotional and there was a bit of emotion with that.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik, the management team hadn’t been in place more than five minutes. It became clearer three months later. We corrected it and are in a different place today.\"",
      "That's even more true today after United entered unfamiliar territory having climbed to sixth in the table. The Red Devils beat Brighton 4-2 on Saturday to celebrate three straight league wins for the first time under the incumbent chief.",
      "United have also now won four home games in a row since losing to Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season. That's seen the club restore some of its former lustre after looking so vulnerable at Old Trafford for stretches of last term and beyond.",
      "Amorim's side sit level on points with bitter rivals City and are just two points below Bournemouth in second. And after so many questions of faith in Amorim's project, there appear to be signs of their investment paying off.",
      "The Portuguese tactician has had to endure a torrent of scrutiny over whether he too was the right man for the job. And although a long road filled with many more potholes lies ahead, there is renewed trust he and United have the means to weather the journey.",
      "Ten Hag, meanwhile, returned to coaching this past summer but was swiftly sacked once more at Bayer Leverkusen. His loss is proving to be not only Amorim's gain, but the change in leadership also vindicates Ratcliffe and his team - for now.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Many Manchester United fans breathed a sigh of relief when Erik ten Hag was shown the door last year - but the feeling wasn't mutual. The Dutchman, dismissed exactly a year ago today after a dismal start to the season, made his emotions clear in the days that followed his departure.",
      "In an open letter to United supporters, Ten Hag admitted that \"the dream has come to an end.\" He went on to thank fans for their \"unshakeable\" support and said he would \"cherish\" the memories of his two trophy-winning triumphs in the FA Cup and League Cup.",
      "\"Dear fans, let me start by thanking you,\" he wrote. \"Thank you for always being there for the club. Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable.\"",
      "He continued: \"We won two trophies - achievements that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Of course, my dream was to bring more trophies to the cabinet. Unfortunately, the dream has come to an end.",
      "\"I wish all Manchester United fans nothing but success, trophies and glory. Your support and the warmth I received from everyone at the club helped me feel at home. Thank you for this chapter in my life, Erik.\"",
      "Ten Hag spent just over two years at the helm. Despite becoming the first United manager to lift a trophy since Jose Mourinho in 2017, his tenure was ultimately defined by inconsistency.",
      "Brief bursts of promise were often undone by long spells of poor form, with Ten Hag struggling to reproduce the fluency and attacking edge that defined his Ajax side. He guided United to League Cup glory in 2023, beating Newcastle 2-0 in the final and reached the FA Cup final later that same season.",
      "United fell short against neighbours Manchester City on that occasion, but they exacted revenge 12 months later, defeating City to claim the 2024 FA Cup. That victory ultimately saved Ten Hag's job - at least temporarily - after United stumbled to an eighth-place finish in the Premier League that year.",
      "A dreadful start to the 2024/25 campaign, however, left United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe with little choice but to pull the trigger. Days later, Ruben Amorim was announced as Ten Hag's replacement.",
      "A year has passed since Ten Hag's departure, yet United, for the most part, remain as turbulent as ever. Amorim did little to stop the rot last season, with the club slumping to a record-low 15th-place finish in the league. To compound their misery, they were beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final, a defeat that cost them a place in the Champions League.",
      "The 2025/26 campaign began in similarly stuttering fashion, but three consecutive league wins - against Brighton, Liverpool and Sunderland - have offered a glimmer of hope that the tide may finally be turning for both Amorim and United.",
      "This weekend, the Red Devils travel to Nottingham Forest, where victory would secure a fourth straight win, something they haven't achieved in nearly two years. After that, they'll have the chance to take revenge on Spurs before heading into the final international break of the year.",
      "Now, Amorim stands at a crossroads. Sustain this newfound momentum and he could yet transform his tenure into the very \"dream\" Ten Hag once envisioned - restoring belief, stability and a sense of direction at Old Trafford.",
      "But if United slip back into old habits, the mood could sour just as quickly. And as history has shown, inconsistency at Manchester United rarely goes unpunished.",

      "His Barcelona side were defeated 2-1 in El Clásico on Sunday by bitter rivals Real Madrid, although Lewandowski was nowhere to be seen.",
      "Among all this speculation, the Polish star had been sidelined due to injury. He suffered a hamstring issue while on international duty earlier this month. He played on for Poland with a bandage on his thigh but has subsequently been out for a few weeks.",
      "But Barcelona and the 37-year-old were handed a big boost on Monday morning when he appeared for training. He completed a full session and the hope is that he will be available for the club's next La Liga fixture.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has once again called out Jamie Carragher for his criticism of Casemiro, after praising the Brazil international's Manchester United performances this season. Former England internationals Ferdinand and Carragher got into a dispute over their differing opinions on the Champions League veteran last year.",
      "Carragher previously irked Ferdinand when he said , 'Leave the football, before the football leaves you,' referring to former Real Madrid star Casemiro. The Liverpool icon has also called the former defender 'a clown' when he was called out over comments about the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "And now, Ferdinand has offered some sterling praise of Casemiro, but couldn't resist bringing up Carragher's initial comments that he believes to be proven wrong. The midfielder has become a regular under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "The 33-year-old has started seven Premier League matches and partnered Bruno Fernandes in midfield. Ferdinand believes he is showing the qualities that made United sign him in the first place.",
      "\"He built a stellar career, a five-time Champions League-winning career on the back of being the glue, the person that nitted the backline and midfield together and just plugged the gaps,\" Ferdinand said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"He wasn't asked to run all over the place, or be a creator. He was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and marshalling an area. And recently this is what we've seen, we've seen something like the old Casermiro.\"",
      "\"It takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about \"leave the game\",' Ferdinand added. \"Which I said at the time I thought it was highly disrespectful when you're talking about a five-time Champions League winner who is going through maybe a changing approach to football at a time where he looked out of sorts.",
      "\"Players lose confidence, players lose form. But I think the call was too early and it was highly disrespectful for someone that has achieved so much in the game.\"",
      "Ferdinand believes Casemiro has benefitted from a tweak to Amorim's system and is playing an important part in United's good form.",
      "\"And I think by looking at how the system has been tweaked in the approach and you're seeing the benefits in someone like Casemiro,\" he said. \"This isn't a 20-game sequence so we're not going to go too crazy but the games we've seen where there's been an upturn in form (he has had an impact).",

      "Ferdinand has now responded to Amorim's comment, admitting that Casemiro would've been 'embarrassed' by his status in the squad last term. However, the former United skipper heaped praise on the Brazilian for showing the determination to bounce back.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"That could have absolutely humiliated him, and it would have. Football players are intelligent in a football environment.",
      "\"They all smell where they are in the pecking order. So if Amorim's telling you that, every player in that squad would have known Casemiro is at the back of their pack, Toby's being called upon before him.",
      "\"Do you know how embarrassing that would have been for Casemiro? But for him to roll his sleeves up and say: 'ain't happening, you all know I'm better than him, you all know I'm the best holding midfielder at the club. Watch this space.'",
      "\"Toby Collyer's at West Brom now. That's no disrespect; I think he's a really good young player with a bright future.",
      "\"I'm just talking about the element of Casemiro having that grit and determination to roll his sleeves up and say, 'No, you're not going to embarrass me, you're not going to roll me out of this club like that, after what I've done. Let's go.'\"",
      "Ferdinand also brought up comments Jamie Carragher made about the midfielder last season. The United icon called out Carragher last year for his 'disrespectful' remarks about Casemiro and hit out at them once again on Monday.",
      "\"Recently, he's looked like the old Casemiro, and it takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about 'leave the football before the football leaves you,'\" he recalled.",
      "\"I said at the time I thought it was highly disrespectful when you're talking about a five-time Champions League winner who's going through, maybe just a change in their approach to football, going through a time where he looked out of sorts. Players lose confidence; they lose form.",
      "\"Sometimes, players' legs go. But I think the call was too early, and I thought it was highly disrespectful for someone who has achieved so much in this game.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has confessed he would have loved to have seen Marcus Rashford flourishing for Manchester United instead of at Barcelona. Rashford secured a season-long loan move to the Spanish giants this summer after being considered expendable by Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Barca possess the option to snap up Rashford for £30million in 2026 and are said to be keen on making the transfer permanent, albeit at a reduced fee. The 27-year-old has excelled during his loan stint at the Camp Nou - bagging five goals and registering seven assists across all competitions for Hansi Flick's squad so far this campaign.",
      "His resurgence has resulted in him securing a return to the England setup under Thomas Tuchel. Former United and Three Lions skipper Rooney has lavished praise on Rashford's outstanding displays in Spain and Tuchel's choice to bring him back into the national team fold.",
      "\"I'd much prefer to see him do that for Man United, if I'm honest,\" Rooney said on his podcast, as he admitted to feeling sad about how the England star's United career has panned out.",
      "\"But no, listen... I don't think it was the easiest start, the first couple of games, and there were people talking about him, but he's got his head down, he's doing well, he's playing well, and for any young English player, and especially someone you know and you want to do well, it's great to see that,\" he added.",
      "\"Listen, Marcus Rashford at his best is a top, top player and that's what we all want to see and just hope he stays settled and he keeps performing, keeps working and if he does that then I don't think there's any doubt about his ability.",
      "\"And you know what, I think fair play to Thomas Tuchel for bringing him in and playing him as well. Now Anthony Gordon has probably gone ahead of him a little bit in Tuchel's plans, it looks like anyway, you don't know.",
      "\"But for bringing him in and playing him and picking him when maybe people didn't think he should. So I think fair play to Tuchel because that gives a player confidence as well.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has sent out a rallying cry to his Barcelona teammates after suffering a setback during his loan spell with the Spanish giants. The Manchester United forward, who moved to Barcelona on a season-long loan during the summer transfer window, has been in fine form for the La Liga side, netting five goals and providing seven assists.",
      "However, Rashford and his team were dealt a blow over the weekend when they lost 2-1 to bitter rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico, leaving them trailing by five points at the top of the Spanish top-flight standings.",
      "Following the defeat, Rashford took to Instagram to share a message with his 21.3 million followers. \"Clearly, not the result that we wanted yesterday. It's a marathon not a sprint and we will keep fighting,\" Rashford wrote, urging his teammates to bounce back from the loss.",
      "Barcelona assistant head-coach Marcus Sorg spoke after the defeat to Madrid, explaining how mistakes cost the reigning La Liga champions against their bitter rivals.",
      "\"I think in the end, we made more mistakes than we're used to,\" Sorg said. \"It's true that our defensive level was very low. In the final third, our penetration power did not allow us to create more chances.\"",
      "Rashford will have another chance to shine for Barcelona on Sunday when they take on Elche in La Liga, hoping to narrow the five-point gap with Madrid.",
      "It was at the start of the summer when Rashford expressed a desire to leave United after spending the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. No permanent move could materialise, but the Red Devils were able to agree a deal with Barcelona for Rashford to spend the campaign on loan until the summer of 2026.",

It is their first season in 11 years that United are not in any European competition after they finished 15th - their lowest finish in the Premier League era and worst since the 1973/74 season where they were relegated.",

Only one game in the division will be played, with the remainder of the fixture list taking place over the following weekend, this year.",
      "The day after Christmas has become an iconic part of the football calendar, with top-flight ties often filling a decent chunk of the day on December 26. Not this year, however, with the Premier League feeling unable to do so in order to fulfil their contractual obligations.",
      "The division is required to have 33 rounds of weekend fixtures and five midweek. Premier League officials must detour from a busy Boxing Day as a result, as first revealed by the Times. An increasing number of weekends are already spoken for throughout the year, with the FA Cup occupying more space after scrapping replays. The Premier League has been left needing to make use of December 27 and 28 to meet its obligations.",

      "This year, December 26 will see the fewest top-flight games take place since the Second World War. Eight matches were played on Boxing Day in 2024.",

      "Ruben Amorim brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko over the summer, and the new trio - along with a fit again Mason Mount - have been preferred in the front three. Fellow frontmen Rasmus Hojlund and Marcus Rashford have already been offloaded by Amorim, initially on loan, and Zirkzee will be next.",
      "According to reports on the continent, Zirkzee's preference is to stay in the Premier League. This could make West Ham an appealing prospect for a player keen for minutes as he chases a spot in the Netherlands' World Cup squad if they get there.",
      "The Euro 2024 semi-finalists need four points from their final two qualifying games, against Lithuania and Poland, to make sure of their World Cup spot. Zirkzee was part of his country's Euros squad, and scored his first senior international goal in the UEFA Nations League in September 2024, but hasn't featured in any of the World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The London club spent more than £100m over the summer but their only new strikers were free agent Callum Wilson and Scottish youngster Daniel Cummings. Wilson has played just once under Nuno, coming on as a first-half substitute in Friday's defeat at Leeds, and Cummings has yet to make his senior debut.",

      "Scott Parker, David Moyes, Daniel Farke, Keith Andrews and Fabian Hurzeler are all relatively safe as it stands.",
      "Moving onto the managers who could well be out of work some time soon, Ruben Amorim is right at the top of that list. The Portuguese coach was under severe pressure only a few weeks ago and it appeared that one adverse result would have seen him moved on.",
      "Fortunately for him, the Red Devils appear to have turned things around over recent weeks. That has seen the pressure ease but another poor run could see him back in the firing line.",

      "Across London, Nuno Espirito Santo has had a rotten season having already been sacked by Nottingham Forest. He’s now at West Ham and has yet to win a game - and should that run of results continue, it could force the club’s ownership to explore another change.",
      "There are some very worrying signs at Molineux - none least Vitor Pereira’s angry clash with supporters at the full-time whistle. It was the sign of a manager under real pressure.",

      "Having netted the first goal within the opening four minutes, Garnacho felt he still had more to give before Chelsea ultimately suffered a 2-1 defeat. Maresca's decision sparked an outcry from Chelsea supporters on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter).",
      "One fan vented: \"Garnacho was probably the only attacker having a decent game... So of course he's the first one Maresca subs off. No wonder he was shaking his head,\" while another posted: \"Maresca taking out the attacker who was most likely to score today in Garnacho was not the move.\"",
      "A third chimed in with: \"Maresca makes terrible substitutions. Why take off Garnacho so early?\"",
      "Garnacho marked his goal by sitting on the advertising hoarding, joined by team-mate Pedro Neto. The celebration served as a nostalgic moment for United fans – it echoed a similar celebration during their victory over West Ham in February 2024 when Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund struck the same pose.",
      "Back then, the trio were hailed as the future of United. However, Garnacho later made the £40million switch to Stamford Bridge, while Hojlund is also tipped to depart Old Trafford, following promising performances during a loan spell at Napoli.",
      "Before his move to the capital, Garnacho was part of United's infamous 'bomb squad', left out in the cold during pre-season as Ruben Amorim planned a major shake-up that included shipping him off along with several teammates.",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son, Kai, has given fans an update on his recovery from injury following a devastating setback at Manchester United earlier this year. The eldest son of the United icon is keen to follow in his dad's illustrious footsteps, but was dealt a blow when he suffered an injury, lamenting: 'Life couldn't get any worse.'",
      "Clearly inheriting his father's love for football, the young talent has been turning heads with his performances for United's youth teams this season. He made a splash during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament where his dad also made his mark as a young player at Everton.",
      "Kai was on a rapid ascent, earning a call-up to United's Under-19s side, where he held his own against professionals four-years his senior.",
      "Before that promotion, he'd netted a stunning goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that found the top corner, echoing some of his dad's memorable strikes.",
      "Earlier this year, Kai posted a photo on social media showing his right foot in a boot, but has now updated followers on his progress.",
      "Now, posting on Instagram, he shared two snaps enjoying some relaxation time in Dubai, with his foot no longer in a protective boot.",
      "The youngster captioned the pictures: \"Recovering\" followed by an emoji shrouded in smoke.",
      "The exact nature of his injury remains unclear, though the photos suggest he may be nearing a return to the pitch.",
      "The young lad typically plays in a central attacking role, much like his father Wayne, but is also capable of playing on either flank.",
      "In a chat with BBC Sport about his son's footballing journey, Rooney shared: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it.",
      "\"Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach.",
      "\"I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Rooney's eldest lad has been part of the United academy since he was 11-years-old, having joined the youth set up in 2020.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been warned he could be sent back to Manchester United by Barcelona. Former England star Chris Waddle has claimed the 27-year-old cannot let his level drop if he hopes to secure a deal to remain at Camp Nou.",
      "Barcelona have an option to sign Rashford permanently at the end of the season for £26million. The Catalan club's sporting director, Deco, has suggested a decision will not be made until later in the season, even with Rashford's promising start.",
      "The forward has five goals and seven assists in 13 appearances this term, and he provided the ball for Fermin Lopez's goal against Real Madrid at the weekend. Rashford impressed in his debut El Clasico despite the defeat.",
      "Rashford is keen to remain in Spain and has described it as a ' perfect scenario ' to play alongside Pedri and Lamine Yamal. But it is not a certainty that his stay will be extended next June.",
      "Waddle reckons Rashford's salary could still pose a problem and that Barcelona will be hesitant to pay so much. The ex-Marseille winger says the Manchester United loanee's form will need to go up another level.",
      "“A major hurdle in any potential signing could be the player's wages. Barcelona may not be willing to match Rashford’s current salary, creating a stumbling block as they typically don't pay that level of compensation,\" said Waddle, speaking to BOYLE Sports, who offer the best football odds.",
      "“Barcelona is linked with many available players. It remains to be seen if they have another target for the left-wing or centre-forward positions, or someone else lined up for the summer.",
      "“This season will be crucial for Rashford. He cannot afford to be inconsistent; he must perform exceptionally in every game as if it's a cup final to secure a deal with Barcelona. This is complicated by the transfer fees involved and his current lucrative contract, which Barcelona may be unwilling to pay.",
      "“The club might be thinking, ‘We're paying his wages, but we've saved a considerable amount on a transfer fee for a season.’",
      "“If he performs exceptionally, scoring 20 goals and consistently earning man of the match, Barcelona would have no choice but to sign him. However, his current performances are merely OK, not unbelievable. As the season progresses, it's essentially a trial period for him.",
      "“He's attempting to secure a contract from a club that is interested but not fully committed. They might send him back if they have another player in mind.",
      "“Most top players will quickly move to clubs like Real Madrid or Barcelona, so Barcelona could have alternative plans.”",

      "Jobe Bellingham has no interest in a shock move to Manchester United. United have been weighing up a potential loan deal for the Borussia Dortmund star.",
      "Bellingham, brother of England and Real Madrid superstar Jude Bellingham, has struggled to settle following his move from Sunderland to Dortmund in the summer. He has made just two league starts for the German giants, and found himself benched for last weekend's home win over Köln.",
      "He had to settle for a short cameo appearance at the end. But despite his frustrations, it's understood Bellingham would snub a move to United, because Ruben Amorim's men are not in the Champions League. If he was to leave Dortmund, the 20-year-old would want to join a club which can offer him games at the highest level.",
      "And the news could see United step up their interest in England and Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher.",
      "Gallagher has not started a game for Diego Simeone's side since September, and knows he needs regular starts to boost his chances of making Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup.",
      "Bellingham was hailed as one of Dortmund's marquee signings when he joined them in a £27m deal in July, but has failed to score in 12 appearances. To make matters worse, there are growing tensions off the pitch between Bellingham's dad Mark Bellingham and Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl.",
      "The pair clashed at the start of the season, when Bellingham senior, a former non-league striker and retired police sergeant, took exception to his son being substituted at half-time on his Bundesliga debut by head coach Niko Kovac. The decision infuriated Mark, who waited in the tunnel after the final whistle to confront members of the club's hierarchy.",
      "The scenario has led to speculation mounting about Bellingham's future.",
      "Amorim is keen to bolster his midfield options, and is expected to make a signing in the January transfer window.",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher and Jay Bothroyd clashed over the decision not to award Manchester United a penalty during the opening period of their 4-2 victory over Brighton. United maintained their impressive form under Ruben Amorim with another commanding performance at Old Trafford.",
      "The Reds surged into a 3-0 advantage courtesy of strikes from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo before the Seagulls fought back. Mbeumo netted his third goal in two matches during stoppage time to propel United to sixth place in the Premier League standings.",
      "A statement from the Premier League Match Centre account on X confirmed: \"The referee's call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "Following the match, Gallagher and Bothroyd discussed a series of contentious refereeing calls, including Amad's incident. Yet they were unable to find common ground, and their disagreement turned fiery.",
      "Bothroyd stated: \"This is a definite penalty for me. Amad Diallo is running into the box. There is the slightest touch.",
      "\"The defender, he puts his leg out, so obviously he has made contact. He touched the ball slightly, but that contact, has stopped Amad getting to the ball.",
      "\"So whether he has touched the ball or not, and it's a minuscule that he has touched that, because the ball is basically travelling in the same direction, he has stopped Amad getting to that. That's why I would say that is a penalty.",
      "\"It's the same as [Viktor] Gyokeres, again the smallest touch. These touches are not enough to say, 'Oh he has touched the ball. It can't be a penalty,' because players can still get back to the ball. That's why I would say the Amad one is a penalty.\"",
      "Gallagher, who officiated matches at the highest level for more than 15 years, took a different view from Bothroyd and referred to similar incidents to explain why the call was made.",
      "He said: \"It's interesting we have seen Gyokeres with Pope, we saw Saka with Kevin and we've seen this one, they've been consistent - if they get a touch on the ball, they are not going to give a penalty, they've done it for week six, week eight and week nine.\"",
      "Bothroyd then replied: \"But they did not do it for week five when Sanchez touched the ball and Mbeumo goes through. So they've changed the rule after week five is basically what you are saying.\"",
      "Unhappy with the comment, Gallagher then fired back: \"I didn't say that at all. I said since the Gyokeres one, where they came out and said, 'He's got a touch on the ball.' In this situation, they have been consistent, as you've asked for, and they haven't given any of them.\"",
      "The decision had little sway on the outcome as United romped into a 3-0 win before sealing victory with a stoppage-time strike after Brighton set up a nervy finish. The victory leaves Amorim's side in sixth place, just six points off league leaders Arsenal.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

      "It was one in and one out for Manchester United's striker department this summer.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival meant it was inevitable Rasmus Hojlund would be on his way out of the club, and so it proved as the Dane signed for Napoli on loan. Hojlund's switch to Naples included an obligation to buy, meaning we won't be seeing him back at Old Trafford in the red of United.",
      "The signing of Sesko and the departure of Hojlund meant is was very much as you were for United's only other senior striker, Joshua Zirkzee. And yet he's still dropped a place in the pecking order.",
      "Despite not being a conventional centre forward, Zirkzee was expected to provide competition and support for Sesko, as he had done the previous season with Hojlund.",
      "At this stage of last season, Zirkzee had made 13 appearances in all competitions, playing a total of 592 minutes. A year on and he has made just five appearances, with his outings amounting to a combined total of just 90 minutes worth of football. Granted last season there were a few more games due to United's Europa League involvement and them spending longer in the Carabao Cup, but clearly the Dutchman isn't being given the chances he was last season.",
      "And it's not because Sesko is flying. The Slovenia international has started to find his feet of late but he still has just two goals in ten games. The reason for the dramatic reduction in Zirkzee's playing time is Ruben Amorim's use of a striker-less formation.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount led the line for United in their opening three league games of the season, with Amorim moving back to the same three-pronged attack against Liverpool.",
      "The Anfield outing was comfortably United's finest performance of the season and proved to Amorim that the striker-less formation can be a genuine option moving forward.",
      "Amorim either doesn't play with a striker or he goes with Sesko. So where does that leave Zirkzee? Surplus to requirements is the answer.",
      "The Netherlands international is understood to be attracting interest from a number of clubs, with West Ham and Sevilla both monitoring his situation.",
      "Valued at £24million by Transfermarkt, there's every chance United could look to cash in on Zirkzee in January as they look to address their problems in midfield, whether that be in the mid-season window or in the summer.",
      "If it hadn't been for the striker-less formation proving its worth, there's every chance United would have decided Zirkzee had to stay.",
      "As it is, he's clearly not going to get the game time he needs ahead of next summer's World Cup. It's within the best interests of all involved for a buyer to be sought.",

      "For all the stick aimed at the likes of Antony and Rasmus Hojlund, at least Manchester United received managed to make some money back when shipping on their big-money mistakes.",
      "United signed Antony from Ajax for a fee rising to £86.3million, before selling him to Real Betis for a fixed fee of €22m (£19m) with a potential €3m (£2.6m) in add-ons. If all add-ons are triggered, that means a loss of £64.7m.",
      "The arrival of Hojlund saw United commit to paying as much as £72m, but with his loan move to Napoli including an obligation to buy at the end of the season for £38m next summer, the £34m loss is far smaller than it could have been.",
      "Jadon Sancho has avoided the wrath of United fans lately, purely down to the fact he has spent so much time away from the club looking to restart his career. His career is still in freefall and there's every possibility he will be allowed to leave for free next summer. £72.9m signing, £72.9m loss. Even Antony and Hojlund weren't that bad.",
      "It seems absolutely unthinkable that a club could spend £72.9m on a player and not choose to trigger a 12-month extension in his contract, thus allowing them the opportunity to try and sell him next summer - the fee would be minimal but it would be better than nothing.",
      "Yet that's the position United in themselves in with Sancho. What chance have they got of offloading a player who Chelsea paid £5m not to sign in the summer and who already looks to be causing problems at Aston Villa after he snubbed Unai Emery's handshake on the touchline on Sunday.",
      "It must be added that United have received some handsome loan fees from Dortmund and Chelsea, meaning their loss on the player won't be as bad as it could have been. But the fact both sides opted against signing him permanently having initially been so keen to take him on a temporary deal says a lot in itself.",
      "Sancho might turn it around at Villa and secure himself a permanent both to Villa Park or elsewhere, but it's difficult to see that happening.",
      "The January transfer window will mark the two-year anniversary of Sancho's loan move to Dortmund, in which time his only United appearance came in the glorified pre-season friendly that is the Community Shield. Two years on and United still don't want him yet still can't sell him.",
      "The argument for letting a £72.9m signing stroll out of the exit door for free is starting to look a compelling one.",

      "Manchester United claimed their third win in a row after beating Brighton 4-2 over the weekend, meaning Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best run of form since taking charge.",
      "United were red hot against the Seagulls at Old Trafford and raced into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo. Brighton provided a late scare with two goals before Mbeumo made sure of the three straight wins.",
      "While the immediate focus is on United's recent upturn in form and next Saturday's trip to Nottingham Forest, transfer talk is still bubbling in the air with the January transfer window approaching.",
      "Over the last few days, players have been linked with a new midfielder, once again, and making a move for one of the best goalscorers in football. The transfer window opens in January and there could be plenty of business to contend with.",
      "Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Angelo Stiller and Robert Lewandowski are all players of interest. It's expected that a new midfielder will be the priority, given that Casemiro's contract expires in the summer.",
      "Tommy Rowe is now Manchester United's Under-15 lead coach after spending last season as a player-coach.",
      "Rowe, who was born in Wythenshawe, came through United's academy and returned to Carrington last year in the innovative player-coach academy role with the Under-21s.",
      "After more than 600 professional appearances with the likes of Stockport County, Peterborough, Wolves, Doncaster and Bristol City, Rowe returned to United's academy to give on-pitch feedback, help coach the U21 group and drive standards on and off the pitch.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to stop some players from leaving the club during the January transfer window.",
      "One of the new signings that United made in the summer was Bryan Mbeumo, who has since scored five goals after his move from Brentford. However, it won't be too long before United won't have the forward at their disposal.",

      "Manchester United will decide on Jadon Sancho's future before the end of the season.",
      "Sancho is contracted at Old Trafford until June, but there is the option of a 12-month extension.",

      "Wayne Rooney has admitted he would prefer to see Marcus Rashford playing well for Manchester United rather than the England international impressing for Barcelona.",
      "Rashford made a season-long loan switch to the Catalan giants this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds head coach Ruben Amorim. Barca have the option to sign Rashford for £30million in 2026 and are reportedly interested in making the move permanent, but at a cut-price rate.",
      "The 27-year-old has impressed in his early days at the Camp Nou - netting five goals and providing seven assists across all competitions for Hansi Flick's team so far this season. His return to form has seen him earn a recall to the England squad under Thomas Tuchel.",

      "\"The Man Utd players were never bad players, they just lacked confidence, but now they are starting to play and that was a good win against Brighton. They got handily beat by Brighton last year so getting four goals was a superb result.",
      "\"They are now starting to turn a corner. They had back-to-back wins, and I was still concerned about this Brighton game. I thought it was a real banana skin for them. It's still early days but that win tells me they are slowly building some momentum.\"",
      "Sesko has shown his true colours by choosing to focus on the team and their mentality after grabbing his first assist for United.",

      "City were reportedly close to signing him, but after being pitched regular first team opportunities he signed scholarship papers with Leicester. However, he cannot sign a professional deal at the club until June next year, meaning the 2016 Premier League winners would be powerless to stop him leaving.",
      "According to TBR Football, City are in front of United in the race for his signature. Monga is a winger who is more than capable of playing anywhere in the frontline.",
      "Manchester United will struggle to convince Jobe Bellingham to move to Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund. The England U21s international has had a difficult start to life in Germany, after moving in the summer.",

      "However, Waddle has warned the forward he cannot afford to let his performances slip. \"This season will be crucial for Rashford. He cannot afford to be inconsistent; he must perform exceptionally in every game as if it's a cup final to secure a deal with Barcelona.",
      "\"This is complicated by the transfer fees involved and his current lucrative contract, which Barcelona may be unwilling to pay. The club might be thinking, 'We're paying his wages, but we've saved a considerable amount on a transfer fee for a season.’",
      "\"If he performs exceptionally, scoring 20 goals and consistently earning man of the match, Barcelona would have no choice but to sign him. However, his current performances are merely OK, not unbelievable. As the season progresses, it's essentially a trial period for him.\"",
      "\"If you look at the positioning of Cunha, he was filling in that midfield role. The system can work, I just don't think they played it in the right way, or have the players to do that. This is the first time I've been convinced that they know what their roles are.",
      "\"The challenge now is consistency. Mbeumo, you give him time and space, he's going to hurt you and he played really well.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to allow Napoli to sign Rasmus Hojlund in January.",
      "According to the Mirror, Antonio Conte's side can sign him permanently for around £38million. The Red Devils allowed the Dane to move to Naples on loan, to make way for Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "After costing £25m in the summer, Bellingham has yet to score in 11 appearances and has only started two league games.",
      "The Sun have reported that Barcelona are pushing to sign Mason Greenwood. Scouts were in attendance to watch the forward bag four goals in their 6-2 win over Le Havre last weekend.",
      "Man United are believed to hold a 50% sell-on clause of any Greenwood departure and a fee worth as little as £25m has been touted.",
      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has revealed why Jadon Sancho was taken off in the 1-0 win over Manchester City after he was brought on in the first-half.",
      "Sancho replaced Emiliano Buendia earlier in the game before returning to the bench in the 74th minute. The winger seemed to cut a disappointed figure, but Emery has revealed that Sancho was always set to have limited minutes to build his fitness.",
      "\"Yes, sure he's not happy, but I did it before with Morgan Rogers, with Emiliano Buendia, with Leon Bailey, and he played 60 minutes on Thursday.",
      "\"Today when he (Buendia) was injured, my plan was maybe in case he (Sancho) was going to play 30 minutes, but I decided to play more and he played 45 minutes. But my plan was when he was swapped with Emiliano Buendia, the idea was maybe not playing all the minutes until the last moment.",
      "\"I told him as well, he can feel it, it's embarrassing. Beofre Mogan, Emiliano Buendia and Leon Bailey, they felt the same when I subbed them, but it was not a punishment. And now it's not a punishment.\"",

      "United are reportedly not planning to trigger their option to extend Casemiro's contract by another year.",

      "Sevilla have joined the race to land Joshua Zirkzee in January, according to the Mirror.",

      "Man United are increasing in confidence that they will sign Morten Hjulmand from Sporting CP with Ruben Amorim pushing for a reunion to sign the midfielder.",

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has ended the club's pursuit in Barcelona forward Robert Lewandowski, despite Ruben Amorim's eagerness to bring him to Old Trafford next summer, as per GOAL.",
      "Lewandowski, 37, is out of contract at Barca in June 2026 and there is talk that he could move to the Premier League, with United among those that have been linked. However, Ratcliffe doesn't want to sign the Poland international, who has scored four times in nine matches this season.",
      "Man United are considering offering Jobe Bellingham an escape route out of Borussia Dortmund, according to reports.",
      "TEAMtalk have claimed that the former Sunderland star has struggled in Germany and could be on the move in January. United are one of the teams linked with the highly-rated midfielder.",

      "Crystal Palace's centre-back has shone in recent seasons and perhaps took everyone by surprise in 2024 when he played so well at the European Championship with England. After that it seemed like only a matter of time before he would leave Selhurst Park.",
      "Guehi nearly joined Liverpool on deadline day but the deal fell through after an agreement for his replacement was not reached. It was not long before Oliver Glasner confirmed the inevitable that Guehi would be leaving at the end of the season.",
      "Now, the likelihood of him moving anywhere other than Liverpool is slim. But United would be wrong not to try and hijack the move.",
      "Centre-back reinforcements are unlikely to be a priority in the summer. However, should Harry Maguire not stay, he will need to be replaced. Most United fans would be delighted to see the centre-back extend his contract but he will have to take a pay cut in order to do so.",
      "Maguire leaving on a free would mean United would need to sign a replacement, something they could do without given the money they will need to spend on their midfield. Guehi arriving on a free would sort that particular problem out.",
      "He is also a good fit for the system having played on the left side of a back three. Luke Shaw has excelled there of late but his injury record is awful, while fellow left-sided option Lisandro Martinez has also had injury troubles.",
      "Guehi has the character needed to succeed at Old Trafford and is Premier League proven, something Ruben Amorim was keen to focus on during the summer transfer window. Given the early success of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, you can imagine Amorim will be keen to do likewise next summer.",
      "If United can persuade Leny Yoro to reject Real Madrid then why can't they convince Guehi to reject Liverpool?",

      "Back to back away games at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham offer further opportunity for this United side to prove they have the credentials to challenge for Europe this season and Amorim will be hoping to maintain the recent momentum.",

Question marks still exist over the viablity of an attack-minded Fernandes and an ageing Casemiro as a midfield pair but Amorim's subtle tactical changes have helped solidfy the central areas.",

      "\"They have the forwards dropping in to support Bruno and Casemiro, and they have found support with Luke Shaw jumping in and statying in there to almost make a three in midfield.",
      "\"In the end it is a numbers game and a spaces game and you have to fill the right spaces. Bruno, Luke Shaw and Casemiro fill that middle of the pitch.",
      "He added: \"I feel there is something building, Casemiro holds the middle of the pitch, Cunha drifts a bit, Bruno has licence to drift a bit higher and Mbuemo can drift off Sesko and there is that bit of fluidity.\"",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim continued their impressive run on Saturday with a third consecutive Premier League victory. They now sit in sixth place following their 4-2 triumph over Brighton.",
      "Amorim faced intense criticism at the start of the season, with calls for his dismissal intensifying after a humiliating Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town. However, the tide appears to be turning.",
      "United's form has seen a significant upturn, with five victories in their last seven matches. In the clash against Brighton, summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo found the back of the net, justifying their combined initial £127million price tag.",
      "Despite this attacking prowess, rumours persist linking the club with Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski. The legendary Polish forward's contract expires next summer and he is reportedly on Amorim's radar, despite initial resistance from Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Lewandowski is reportedly on United's shortlist and despite Ratcliffe's initial dismissal of a move, the striker remains highly regarded by manager Amorim.",
      "His Barcelona side suffered a 2-1 defeat in El Clásico on Sunday at the hands of arch-rivals Real Madrid, with Lewandowski notably absent from the action.",
      "Amid all this conjecture, the Polish striker had been ruled out through injury. He picked up a hamstring problem whilst representing his country earlier this month. He continued playing for Poland with strapping around his thigh but has since been absent for several weeks.",
      "But Barcelona and the 37-year-old received welcome news on Monday morning when he returned to training. He took part in a complete session and there is optimism that he will be fit for the club's upcoming La Liga match.",
      "In March, Ineos and Ratcliffe revealed their plans to construct a 100,000-capacity ground built alongside the existing Old Trafford. This project was allocated a budget of approximately £2billion.",
      "Nevertheless, these bold proposals for an enormous new stadium have encountered obstacles and a financial analyst expects that the minority stakeholders will retreat from the venue's size.",
      "\"I expect to see compromises being made,\" expert Keiran Maguire told United In Focus. \"We've already seen that with the somewhat laughable canopy idea being dropped.",
      "\"I would anticipate that the next big decision will be in terms of ground capacity. 100,000 seats is not necessary. I would be surprised if United can do this on budget.\"",
      "Several of United's summer signings have begun to shine and one player who has secured a regular place under Amorim immediately is goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "The Belgian arrived on deadline day from Royal Antwerp for £18.2m, with the position having been a problem to begin the campaign. United legend Gary Neville believes his presence has helped settle the starting XI.",
      "\"The goalkeeper [Lammens] looks like he's a lot more solid and stable than the other two,\" admitted the ex-United defender on his The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I like goalkeepers who've got a composure to them, a relaxed manner. You can see it in the Lammens. He is somebody who looks composed, and that's not easy. I've said it before that the toughest job possible is to be the United goalkeeper. He's settled in well.\"",

      "Rashford made a season-long loan switch to the Catalan giants this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds head coach Ruben Amorim. Barca have the option to sign Rashford for £30million in 2026 and are reportedly interested in making the move permanent, but at a cut-price rate.",
      "The 27-year-old has impressed in his early days at the Camp Nou - netting five goals and providing seven assists across all competitions for Hansi Flick's team so far this season. His return to form has seen him earn a recall to the England squad under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Former United and Three Lions captain Rooney has heaped praise on Rashford's impressive form in Spain and Tuchel's decision to recall him to the national team set-up.",
      "“I'd much prefer to see him do that for Man United, if I'm honest,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney show. \"But no, listen… I don't think it was the easiest start, the first couple of games, and there were people talking about him, but he's got his head down, he's doing well, he's playing well, and for any young English player, and especially someone you know and you want to do well, it's great to see that.",
      "\"Listen, Marcus Rashford at his best is a top, top player and that's what we all want to see and just hope he stays settled and he keeps performing, keeps working and if he does that then I don't think there's any doubt about his ability.",
      "\"And you know what, I think fair play to Thomas Tuchel for bringing him in and playing him as well. Now Anthony Gordon has probably gone ahead of him a little bit in Tuchel’s plans, it looks like anyway, you don't know.",
      "\"But for bringing him in and playing him and picking him when maybe people didn't think he should. So I think fair play to Tuchel because that gives a player confidence as well.”",
      "Rashford's next chance to impress for Barcelona will be in Sunday's La Liga clash at home to Elche (5:30pm kick-off UK time). He will then be involved in games against Club Brugge and Celta Vigo before the November international break.",

      "Amorim reiterated that the player's eagerness to move to Manchester was crucial when he praised Mbeumo during his press conference after the 4-2 victory against Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions.",
      "\"They are really fast, they are good in one against one. My role [in signing Mbeumo] was as a manager to explain what I want from him but it was more the club and you guys.",
      "\"We can struggle a lot but it's Manchester United. When Manchester United is there... and when we feel that this player wants to come here, no matter what, no matter what the position, no matter if it's Champions League or not, we also give everything to bring these kind of guys and that was the case.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance to watch United's summer signings play a pivotal role in the victory. \"It's more for the fans,\" said Amorim when asked about winning in front of Ratcliffe.",

      "Shearer added: \"You've got to give big credit to Man United after their result last weekend, they had to [win] because you can imagine if they win at Liverpool and then they won't win at home, you know what the scenario and what everyone's going to be saying.",

      "\"That result and the run they're on will give everyone confidence and huge belief that his system can work. Let's see, good result, but let's see in the next month or so. For them going forward, you've got to say well done.\"",
      "\"What Man United have be crying out for is, if you're going to play that system, to be brave,\" Richards added. \"Luke Shaw was very brave in the way he stopped in and they go and get the goal.",
      "\"If you look at the positioning of Cunha, he was filling in in that midfield role. The system can work, I just don't think they played it in the right way, or the players to do that, this is the first time I've been convinced that they know what their roles are.",
      "\"I agree with Alan now, the challenge now is consistency. Mbeumo, you give him time and space, he's going to hurt you and I thought he played really well as well.\"",

      "\"Clearly he can. It's not phased him in the slightest. I wouls say the same for Cunha. Obviously he's got the experience of Altetico Madrid, which you know, is obviously one of the big boys in Spain, but Manchester United is a little different.\"",

      "Aston Villa's loanee Jadon Sancho was brought on in the first half against Manchester City on Sunday, only to be taken off after just 45 minutes on the pitch.",
      "The winger came on for the injured Emi Buendia during the opening period, but was replaced by Evann Guessand 16 minutes from time as part of a double substitution.",
      "Since his late summer loan move from Manchester United, Sancho has seen limited game time. Prior to facing City, he had made just one substitute appearance in the league, although he did start in the midweek Europa League defeat against Go Ahead Eagles.",
      "The 25-year-old recently returned from illness, with his game in the Netherlands marking his first since a period out. However, Unai Emery didn't seem particularly impressed with his performance against City, opting instead to bring on fellow summer signing Guessand to help close out the match.",
      "Sancho did have a chance at goal shortly before being substituted. He made a neat break from the left, forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma, and his subsequent attempt was also thwarted by the City goalkeeper.",
      "Villa were leading 1-0 when Sancho came on, thanks to an early goal from Matty Cash. The score remained the same when the winger was substituted, as Villa sought to disrupt their rivals' title bid.",
      "A late loss to City towards the end of last season hampered Villa's Champions League qualification hopes, but Emery knew that a victory on Sunday could inflict a similar setback on Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "City believed they had salvaged a point late on when Erling Haaland bundled the ball over the line, but the strike was chalked off for offside in the build-up.",
      "When the six minutes of stoppage time elapsed, Cash's first-half effort proved sufficient for a home victory for Villa. Guardiola's side remained fourth in the standings when the final whistle sounded, but their position is precarious.",
      "Villa sit just one point adrift of them, whilst Tottenham had an opportunity to overtake City by defeating Everton in Sunday's late fixture.",
      "In September, Emery outlined his ambitions for Sancho. \"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best - and if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team,\" the Spaniard said.",

      "Marcus Rashford's assist for Barcelona against Real Madrid on Sunday afternoon should be a clear message to the talent Ruben Amorim is missing out on at Manchester United.",
      "The Reds academy graduate made his way to Catalonia on a season-long loan this summer, after falling out of favour at Old Trafford upon Amorim's arrival last November. Rashford found himself omitted from the Portuguese tactician's plans before spending the latter stages of last term on loan with Aston Villa.",
      "When he remained surplus to requirements upon his return from the Midlands, the 27-year-old was quick to push for another move away from United - either temporarily or permanently. His wish was granted when Barcelona snapped him up on a year-long loan with an option to buy, and to say that Rashford has thrived with the Catalan giants since would be an understatement.",
      "The forward has already totted up five goals from 12 outings across all competitions, and registered his seventh assist of the season against Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday afternoon. A goal down at the time thanks to Kylian Mbappe's early strike, Alejandro Balde picked up the ball on the edge of Madrid's box 38 minutes in before penetrating the backline to find Rashford wheeling away.",
      "From there, the Englishman unselfishly cut the ball back to Fermin Lopez, who cannoned it home past a floundering Thibaut Courtois. Barcelona's lead unfortunately didn't last too long, however, with Jude Bellingham finding the back of the net two minutes ahead of the interval, and that's how it finished as the hosts won 2-1.",
      "Rashford's fine form this season should be a warning sign to Amorim that he may well have let one of United's finest talents slip through his fingers early into his tenure in the north west.",
      "While Barcelona only have Rashford until season's end at present, the club also hold an option to buy him after his loan spell - thought to be for around £30million.",
      "It could be a steal for Barca, should they choose to exercise the clause, given that Rashford's market value will surely continue to rise should he continue to excel in La Liga and the Champions League.",
      "Regardless, Manchester United have been doing well without one of their most talented academy products. The Reds are currently enjoying a three-game winning streak, courtesy of wins over Sunderland, Liverpool and most recently, Brighton.",
      "United returned to Premier League action on Saturday evening to face the Seagulls on home soil, running out 4-2 winners as goals from Matheus Cunha and Casemiro, as well as a Bryan Mbeumo brace, cancelled out Danny Welbeck and Charalampos Kostoulas' strikes.",

      "Barcelona came into Sunday's matchup missing a raft of key men. Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, Gavi and Dani Olmo were each absent from the attack and midfield alone.",
      "Nonetheless, Sport gave an encouraging preview of Rashford's prospects ahead of his first Clasico. And the Catalan newspaper celebrated his stay thus far, saying the Red Devils outcast is \"living the dream\" since moving the Camp Nou on a season-long stay.",
      "\"So much so that in the most-watched match on the planet, in the sporting event that generates the most passion and impact, he'll be a starter,\" read the report. \"Rashford will have a starring role in a true Clasico. When the ball is kicked off, he’ll be one of the surprise guests at the table for LaLiga’s most important match.",
      "\"Predictably, with Ferran back in the starting lineup, he’ll play on the left wing. A golden opportunity for the British icon to continue showing the world that he’s back and on the right path.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo was less complimentary of his performance and called the display \"baffling.\" The recap of his contribution read: \"His smart assist to Fermin...didn't fix a match in which he seemed capable of creating more danger than he did when he received the ball. He didn't make the most of his power when he had space. As a No. 9, he was worse than as a winger.\"",
      "Portions of that comment could be seen as confusing considering Rashford's input was still more than most of his team. However, Ruben Amorim will surely be one looking on the plus side after suggesting he's happy Rashford's enjoying his football last week.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United rolled back the years with their performance in the win over Brighton, while also seeing a glimpse of a brighter future.",
      "That's according to a number of national media titles, who saw Ruben Amorim's side win three games on the bounce for the first time under his leadership, moving into the Premier League's top-four ahead of Sunday afternoon's games.",
      "United had come unstuck in previous encounters with Brighton, but rose to the occasion and saw signs of progress in their project.",
      "Here's what the national media had to say following the win over the Seagulls...",
      "The Guardian wrote: \"The Portuguese [head coach] was not happy at the late near-capitulation but can be content with how his tactic of having Luke Shaw move up from left centre-back to harry Georginio Rutter led to Mbeumo’s first strike having already played a part in Casemiro’s goal.",
      "\"Shaw certainly looked to have fouled the No 10 in the build-up but, with the video assistant referee uninterested, Mbeumo raced on to a cute Benjamin Sesko pass to fire a 20-yard finish which went through Lewis Dunk’s legs and beat Bart Verbruggen to the goalkeeper’s left.",
      "\"Cut to the head coach’s celebration and verses of “Ruben Amorim, Ruben Amorim” from the ecstatic home fans, who heralded at the close a third consecutive Premier League win in the same season for a first time since February 2024.",
      "\"But this was confirmed only after Patrick Dorgu’s pulling down of Yankuba Minteh precipitated United conceding twice. First, Danny Welbeck blazed a free-kick beyond Senne Lammens, the United goalkeeper surely disappointed not to deal with it better as the ball went at him rather than for a corner. In added time James Milner’s corner from the right caught United slumbering and the unmarked Charalampos Kostoulas headed in.",
      "\"In all this were signs of the project in progress United still are, but it finished as a good day’s work that began with two penalty shouts being turned down by Taylor. An Amad Diallo jink past Maxim De Cuyper caused the left-back to clip him but the referee was unmoved – to home ire. Further fury followed when Dunk seemed to grab Mbeumo in the area.\"",
      "Simon Stone of BBC Sport wrote: \"Ratcliffe was at Old Trafford to watch this latest triumph. It is only the second time under Amorim that United have won three games in a row. Without combining the start of last season and the end of the one before, it is the first time they have won three league games in a row since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag.",
      "\"A notoriously blunt speaker, did Ratcliffe really mean it when he said Amorim needed three years to prove his worth, or was he just buying the former Sporting coach some time?",
      "\"It does seem Ratcliffe is on board with Amorim's vision. The improved results, Amorim says, are more helpful in offering a glimpse of a better future to the United fans.",
      "\"'I never had that feeling of embarrassment, of what I was doing or not winning games,' he said. 'I always felt Jim believed and knew what we were doing.",
      "\"'It is more with the fans. Facing the fans is different in this moment. But I feel the urgency of not losing this moment. Everything in football can change in one week.'\"",
      "The Daily Mail wrote: \"On the weekend the clocks go back, Manchester United did their bit with a swaggering, swashbuckling performance that revived memories of some of the great nights at Old Trafford. This grand old theatre rocked with joy, jubilation and, ultimately, a little relief as Ruben Amorim’s side put Brighton to the sword to win a third game in a row and move into the top-four, however temporary it may prove to be.",
      "\"If beating Liverpool at Anfield a week ago marked the high point of Amorim’s first year in charge, this wasn’t far behind. The challenge was to build on that success, and United did it with a confidence and relish so badly missing from their performances under him over the last 12 months.",
      "\"As the fans lapped it up, Sir Jim Ratcliffe – watching from the directors’ box – must have been quietly congratulating himself for holding his nerve when doubts hung over Amorim’s future just a few weeks ago. Rarely has trust been so richly rewarded. Let’s not forget, this is a Brighton side that have lorded it over United in recent seasons, winning no fewer than six of the previous seven Premier League meetings between the two clubs.",
      "\"The great United teams played with flair but sometimes flew by their seat of their pants, and that was the story here in a real ding-dong encounter.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",
      "Man United with Casemiro on the pitch: 3 goals conceded",
      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "Has the Premier League entered an era of chaos? Last season should have been a clue, and here are 10 things about this season that make no sense.",
      "Liverpool will be back, but there will be some casualties of their rebuild (seven, to be exact) with Arne Slot and Mo Salah among those in danger…",
      "As Exeter City fans chant “we own our football club”, they are not indulging in hyperbole: they mean it.",
      "Manchester United are not back *yet*, but they are on track as they are making the right steps regarding their next marquee signing…",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "It feels sub-optimal for your manager to openly admit ‘we have not found an answer yet’ to a problem which Liverpool will keep facing this season."

      "Manchester United are not back *yet*, but they are on track as they are making the right steps regarding their next marquee signing…",
      "It has been a pretty great couple of weeks for Man Utd, with the first back-to-back Premier League wins under Ruben Amorim becoming three straight victories over the weekend.",
      "Credit should go to Amorim as he has made slight tweaks to his approach to make his system more effective and this has borne fruit against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Amorim is far from out of the woods, but for the first time in his tenure, it feels like the Red Devils are on an upward curve and can mount a sustained push for Champions League qualification this term.",
      "This is largely down to Man Utd bucking a long-term trend by having a very successful transfer window with a near-perfect hit rate.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland, Nuno, Arsenal, Wolves, Brentford, Liverpool and more",
      "Summer signings Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have forced a U-turn on the transfer debate as winners Man Utd actually had a better window than losers Liverpool.",
      "All four players have settled nicely in recent weeks and have made a great impact on their winning run, while Man Utd also did a good job at offloading unwanted talents on their terms.",
      "Still, Man Utd’s summer transfer window was not perfect as they failed to sign a quality No.6.",
      "The Red Devils did try to sign one as they pursued an audacious deal for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, though they opted against signing an alternative after being priced out of a £100m-plus transfer.",
      "Without Baleba or another No.6, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have started together in most of Man Utd’s games and although the Brazilian’s revival has been outstanding, Amorim’s side remain far too easy to play through even in the games they have won.",
      "So if Man Utd are to truly be back under Amorim, an upgrade on Casemiro needs to be their next marquee signing, and this looks increasingly likely to be the case.",
      "But this does not mean necessarily mean Baleba.",
      "A report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd have ‘serious doubts’ about a ‘record’ deal for Baleba as he is ‘not yet worth breaking the bank for’.",
      "And these concerns are justified as Baleba is far from the final product and there are issues surrounding his mentality; his performances have clearly been impacted by transfer speculation this season.",
      "The report claims Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ’emerging as names of interest’ and these two would be cheaper than Baleba, while also potentially being better fits for the No.6 role at Old Trafford.",
      "And a contract ‘decision’ is another positive sign for Man Utd, with Football Insider claiming they ‘are not planning to trigger the extension option’ in Casemiro’s deal to extend his deal to 2027 on the same terms.",
      "Although Casemiro’s performances this season have been stronger than in 2024/25, he remains a weak link in Man Utd’s side and his reported £375,000-a-week contract cannot be justified at this stage of his career.",
      "Casemiro could stay at Man Utd by accepting a sizable pay cut, but this feels pretty unlikely with Saudi Pro League sides ‘tracking’ the veteran midfielder. Signing Wharton or Anderson to replace him will be a necessary upgrade in a key department to take the club to the next level under Amorim.",
      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",
      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has quickly deleted a cheeky social media post that added fuel to speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Jamie Carragher over his ‘disrespect’ of a Manchester United star who’s proven him wrong under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Having looked destined for the sack after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford a month ago, three Premier League wins on the bounce has given Amorim some breathing space at Old Trafford with United now fifth in the table.",
      "And with praise being readily afforded to summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens in recent weeks, Ferdinand hailed Casemiro for his rejuvenation this term.",
      "“Casemiro’s game is not about chasing high up the pitch constantly,” the former United defender said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“He built a stellar career on the back of being the glue, the person that knitted the back line and the midfield together and just plug the gaps. He wasn’t asked to run all over the place or be a creator. He was asked to get it and give it to the people that can create.",
      "“He might have scored the odd goal here and there when he went a bit loose, but he was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and being able to stay in an area and marshal that area.",
      "“Recently, this is what we’ve seen. He’s looked something like the old Casemiro.”",
      "Casemiro impressed in his first season for United after making his £70m move from Real Madrid, but two poor seasons followed for the Brazilian, who has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit throughout that inauspicious spell.",
      "And Carragher urged Casemiro to “call it day” after a particularly poor display in a 4-0 defeat against Crystal Palace in May 2024.",
      "“Leave the football, before the football leaves you,” he said. “The football has left him at this top level. He has to call it a day at this level of football and move.”",
      "But of the 16 goals United have conceded this season, just three of them have come with Casemiro on the pitch, and Ferdinand has used this evidence of his revival to aim a jab at Carragher.",
      "“It takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about, ‘leave the football’,” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“I said at the time, I thought it was highly disrespectful when you’re talking about a five-time Champions League winner who’s going through a change in approach to football, going through a time where he looked out of sorts.",
      "“Players lose confidence, they lose form, sometimes players’ legs go, but I think the call was too early and I thought it was highly disrespectful for someone who’s achieved so much in the game.",
      "“Sometimes you’ve got to look beyond just trying to find an individual. We’re very fond of finding a scapegoat. Sometimes you got to look at the way a team is playing and work out is that impacting a player negatively or is it actually the player who’s gone?",
      "“I think by looking at the way that the system’s changed a little bit and been tweaked, you’re seeing the benefits for someone like Casemiro.",
      "“Amorim spoke glowingly about him, about his character, his resilience. You don’t win five Champions Leagues without those two aspects in your makeup.",
      "“Now he’s the reference point for any player that’s going through a hard time at this football club.”",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has declared a “crisis” at Anfield after recent results left their Premier League title defence in tatters.",
      "Jamie Carragher insists that Man City striker Erling Haaland could be the biggest obstacle between Arsenal and winning the Premier League title this season.",
      "Carragher thinks the Arsenal star might just be “the most influential player in the Premier League” after another excellent display in the 1-0 over Crystal Palace.",
      "After smashing Atletico Madrid, Arsenal are the favourites to win the Champions League this season, according to Opta’s supercomputer.",
      "Jamie Carragher feels Mohamed Salah has lost an asset which he felt made him a more dangerous attacker, especially when he was playing with Sadio Mane in the Liverpool attack.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has claimed a Liverpool summer signing may already be regretting his decision to move to the club, suggesting doubts will be dominating his thoughts."

      "Vinicius Junior muttered “I’m leaving the team” having failed to hide his frustration at being substituted in El Clasico and reports on Monday suggest he is ‘seriously considering’ an exit owing the lack of ‘respect’ afforded to him by manager Xabi Alonso. But where could he go? There’s just one option.",
      "Vinicius has helped Madrid win 14 trophies since his arrival in 2018, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, playing a starring role in many of those triumphs. But the 2024 Ballon d’Or runner-up’s frustrations – which have been bubbling under the surface for weeks at the Bernabeu – came to the surface as he stormed off the pitch on Sunday.",
      "After starting on the bench for Madrid’s previous league clash with Getafe, Vinicius was recalled to Alonso’s XI as goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham sealed Madrid a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, but was withdrawn in the 72nd minute by Alonso and made it abundantly clear what he thought of his manager’s decision.",
      "“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?” Vinicius was heard shouting at Alonso as his No.7 appeared on the fourth official’s board.",
      "The 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes in just three of Madrid’s 12 games in all competitions this season and before making his way straight down the tunnel, he’s alleged to have muttered: “Always me! I’m Leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!”",
      "And according to AS, ‘the option of leaving’ is now ‘being seriously considered’ by Vinicius, who believes Alonso ‘doesn’t like him’ and that his ‘status isn’t respected’ by the Spaniard, with the growing rift between the pair a ‘massive problem’ for the club.",
      "Alonso looked to pacify the situation after the game, saying: “I’m taking away many positive things from Vini’s game and I don’t want to lose focus on what’s important.",
      "“He contributed a lot. It’s an important victory, a deserved one. Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.",
      "“Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.”",
      "The report adds that the Madrid hierarchy are prepared to back any decision Alonso makes with regard to Vinicius’ future having been far from impressed by the winger’s reaction to being subbed.",
      "And with it suggested last month that Vinicius may seek a January exit having been benched for Madrid’s Champions League opener, we can only assume his resolve to seek pastures new has gathered strength after this latest perceived snub.",
      "But the question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be the man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case. And there’s nowhere to go for him but Saudi Arabia.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain used to be a landing spot for the star misfits of other European giants, but they’ve become a serious football team of late.",
      "Liverpool made several Galactico signings in the summer, but to their cost so far this season, and we can’t see Arne Slot welcoming such a character into his dressing room.",
      "MORE REAL MADRID COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Raphinha hits out at Barcelona team-mate Yamal for giving Real Madrid ‘extra motivation’ in El Clasico\n👉 Jude Bellingham aims savage three-word dig at Lamine Yamal after El Clasico bust-up\n👉 The ridiculous records of Kylian Mbappe, including his 23 career hat-tricks",
      "If anyone could get a handle on Vinicius, it might just be Pep Guardiola, but Manchester City haven’t typically chased players of such repute, other than Erling Haaland, who joined for the relatively meagre prices they’re used to paying for their recruits.",
      "Arsenal may still be after a left-wing upgrade, but much as we would enjoy his clash with Arteta, theirs is a boat that doesn’t need rocking.",
      "Manchester United aren’t in a position to attract a player of Vinicius’ quality even if they wanted to, and we can’t imagine they do at a point where Ruben Amorim looks finally to have his squad pulling together as one.",
      "There’s very little chance of Chelsea paying that much for a player who is on the brink of being too old for them anyway at 25, and even less chance of Vinicius joining a club where the chances of the most major trophies look slim in the short-term.",
      "And given there is no European club other than PSG outside the Premier League with the wherewithal to pay Real Madrid and Vinicius what’s required to sign him, even assuming they had the desire, if we were his advisors, and weren’t the money-grabbing so-and-sos we suspect they are, we would urge him to mend bridges which are currently singed at a club from which he has no better, or even remotely comparable, place to go, before he burns them beyond repair.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly willing to sacrifice any player, except Kylian Mbappe, to land Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz. So, Vinicius Jr to Man Utd then?",
      "Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior reportedly ‘will be sold’ in the summer if he rejects a contract offer, with a £300million bid coming, per an insider.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City have finally ‘convinced’ a Real Madrid star to leave and join Pep Guardiola’s side in a ‘radical’ U-turn.",
      "Real Madrid are ready to let Vinicius Junior leave the club on a free transfer amid interest from Arsenal and Liverpool, according to reports.",

      "Mainoo is in a difficult situation at Man Utd as he has fallen down the pecking order under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The England international enjoyed a remarkable breakout season for Man Utd and England in 2023/24, though injuries, a decline in form and the appointment of Amorim have impacted him.",
      "Amorim is clearly not a huge admirer of Mainoo, who has only been a bit-part player over the past year as the United boss has favoured Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in midfield.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is far more likely to leave Man Utd in January, though.",
      "The forward has barely featured for Man Utd this season as he’s behind Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the pecking order.",
      "Zirkzee was linked with an exit in the summer, but he looks set to follow Rasmus Hojlund in the coming months.",

      "It was shortly after an impassioned rant from Roy Keane about the state of Manchester United – a shocking turn of events in itself – that Ruben Amorim felt compelled to stand up for one particular “f***ing imposter” in his squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes had just scored a clever free-kick against Arsenal which undoubtedly helped his case, but Amorim wanted to underline the Portuguese’s importance further.",
      "“We need more Brunos, that is clear,” he said. “It’s not just the quality and the character. He makes some mistakes but he is so decisive with and without the ball.",
      "“He steps up all the time. He can show some frustration in some moments that can hurt him more than everyone. I understand that. He wants to win.",
      "“But he is always available, can play in different positions and when we need a goal and an assist he is always there.”",
      "The exorcism of a fair few Brighton ghosts suggested “more Brunos” were indeed delivered at great expense in the summer.",
      "Fernandes was integral to the win; no player had more touches, created more chances, had more shots nor made more tackles. And his dummy for the clinching Bryan Mbeumo goal was a piece of extraordinary awareness and skill.",
      "But for the first time since he joined, Manchester United scored four times in a Premier League game without Fernandes being credited with either a goal or an assist.",
      "That does require some erasure of that stoppage-time feint to leave Ayden Heaven’s pass to run through to Mbeumo but it still shows that Manchester United are becoming less cripplingly dependent on their best player.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up. Matheus Cunha, too, with his wonderful opener. And Benjamin Sesko, whose glorious touch, turn and pass set Mbeumo free for his first.",
      "With Casemiro and Luke Shaw chipping in too it was strange to watch a Manchester United side thrive and combine in attack without desperately trying to shift the ball to Fernandes as quickly as possible.",
      "It took until his 300th appearance for the club for others to shoulder more of that responsibility but it’s better late than never. And for his entire Old Trafford career before last weekend it really did feel as though ‘never’ was the far likelier option.",
      "Keane was right when he said “talent is not enough” back in March, and that attitude and application are at least as important in the equation for making the most optimal teams and individuals. But Fernandes always felt like a strange subject to centre that argument around considering the effort he has expended each week for almost six years.",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos, more characters, more leaders for far too long. Amorim might finally have got his wish.",
      "Has the Premier League entered an era of chaos? Last season should have been a clue, and here are 10 things about this season that make no sense.",
      "Liverpool will be back, but there will be some casualties of their rebuild (seven, to be exact) with Arne Slot and Mo Salah among those in danger…",

      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",

      "The time has come to stop viewing Sunderland through the prism of a newly promoted team. It underlines their immediately acclimatised brilliance to compare their results and performances to those who have come up from the Championship in recent years, but also does them a massive disservice and puts a natural ceiling on what they can achieve.",
      "This is, for all intents and purposes, a ready-made and proven Premier League side. They have remarkable depth – only four clubs have used more players so far – and can win games in a variety of ways.",
      "If they don’t catch you from a corner or a counter, Granit Xhaka will find an alternative route through or Wilson Isidor will exploit the space in behind.",
      "Regis Le Bris is fully subscribed to the power of long throws and set-pieces, but Sunderland have also scored more goals in open play than Arsenal and Newcastle, with just Arsenal, Brighton, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs boasting more different scorers. They have won matches with 54% and 32% possession.",
      "No club has gained more points from losing positions than a Sunderland side which has dropped none when winning. Sure, they have already passed the tallies of the last two teams to come up and finish bottom, but the Black Cats also have more points than Leicester did at this stage in 2015/16.",
      "They probably won’t win their seventh English top-flight title this season, but that qualifier being necessary for Sunderland about four years after they were in the midst of a losing run against Charlton, Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday in League One, when Le Bris was managing a French club’s B team and waiting for his first post at a senior level, is astonishing.",
      "",
      "It would have been a phenomenal weekend had they not even played, with Liverpool and Manchester City both falling to obstacles of a similar size and difficulty to facing Crystal Palace at home.",
      "Mikel Arteta told his players he “valued more this victory than any other victory this season because we knew the difficulty of it”. Palace are an obdurate opponent but at the end of an eight-day stretch in which they also faced Fulham away and Atletico Madrid at home, it was a substantial test of their mental strength and credentials.",
      "Arsenal did not concede a single goal in those games. Their majesty is built not on set-piece mastery but unmatched defensive excellence. They have kept five consecutive clean sheets and faced at least 13 fewer shots than any other team.",
      "Had Arsenal automatically conceded every shot on target they had allowed this season they would still be in the top half of the table with 13 points, while occupying a seeded Champions League knockout phase place. David Raya is more libero than goalkeeper at this point.",
      "Only four clubs in the entire history of the Premier League have conceded fewer than three goals after nine games – and that Chelsea 2005/06 side is not actually among them. A ludicrous record is in genuine jeopardy.",
      "",
      "Perhaps Arsenal won’t replace Mikel Arteta with Nicolas Jover, and Aston Villa might not promote Austin MacPhee to Unai Emery’s seat in the dugout. But the appointment of Keith Andrews as Brentford manager ahead of the season of the long throws seems like remarkable prescience.",
      "That is not to denigrate an entirely deserved win over the champions. As with Arsenal, the Brentford set-piece approach only works when underpinned by energy, bravery and clarity. It is designed to complement their quality rather than define it.",
      "Brentford are intelligent with their pressing, incisive when counter-attacking and committed in defence. Those are the foundations, not Michael Kayode launching it into the box.",
      "As Andy Robertson said, “you can’t come to Brentford away and just expect to play them off the park because they’re always going to be ready to fight”. But they can absolutely play too. You might say they are as adept at floating like a butterfly as they are stinging like the Bees if you were so inclined.",

      "But Bournemouth also have an exceptional coach to bring everything together, and a unity which seems to run all the way through the chain of command.",
      "Their only Premier League defeat this season was basically a case of poor timing; had they faced Liverpool at any other time beyond that opening weekend, Bournemouth might well have won.",
      "And the way in which Andoni Iraola has drilled these players to the extent that they are essentially interchangeable is ridiculous. Veljko Milosavljevic can already be trusted to deputise at 18 and Eli Junior Kroupi has stepped up incredibly well in place of Evanilson at 19.",

      "Perhaps only Ange Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest and Vitor Pereira’s Wolves have been easier assignment in this season’s top flight, and Leeds were lucky enough to face and beat the latter too.",
      "Only five clubs have picked up more points against sides currently in the bottom half; winning these six-pointers is a handy knack for Daniel Farke’s side to develop.",

      "For the first time since April 13, a run stretching back 17 matches, Newcastle have won a Premier League game in which they also conceded. Each of their last five victories had been to nil but this was overdue proof they can just about strike a balance between defence and attack.",
      "With clean sheets on the agenda, the Rafa Benitez ‘short blanket’ analogy again comes to mind. He frequently spoke of the inherent difficulty in finding an equilibrium between keeping the ball out of one net and scoring in the other. “If you cover your head, you have your feet cold, but if you cover your feet, you have your head cold,” he would say at a time when managing a club owned by Mike Ashley meant he was fortunate to have the choice between the two.",
      "This version of Newcastle is far closer to that than the We’ll Score One More Than You energy of Kevin Keegan, with seemingly only Liverpool able to evoke the free-scoring spirit of The Entertainers. But Eddie Howe will delight in seeing his side finally learn how to convert a score draw into a win.",
      "",
      "There is no bigger swing between a Premier League team’s PPG home and away this season. Spurs will need to bring their form in north London more in line with that everywhere else at some point but it is handy to develop a knack for winning every other week.",
      "And Guglielmo Vicario has already matched his Premier League clean sheet tally from last season. What a club.",
      "",
      "The face swaps are imminent. West Ham and Nuno might have felt like a perfect marriage born out of opportunism but in less than a month both have been given cause to regret their decisions.",
      "Nuno has accepted the keys to a broken home. West Ham are a complete mess, a picture of complacency and hubris being steered aimlessly by individuals who seemed to believe they were somehow above or insulated from this sort of crisis.",
      "If this ship cannot be turned around or prevented from inevitably capsizing, it will be difficult to think of a more disastrous line of managerial succession than Moyes-Lopetegui-Potter-Nuno. The middle two have since taken up international coaching roles, so harrowing was their last club experience.",
      "And of course West Ham now apparently plan to solve their myriad problems with a busy and ambitious January transfer window, as if their head of recruitment wasn’t sacked earlier this month and they didn’t spend well over £100m in the summer on players the majority of whom apparently cannot be trusted to start.",
      "Nuno dropped Mateus Fernandes – who came on to score – while once again almost completely ignoring Soungoutou Magassa until it was entirely too late.",

I think this was in response to everyone trying to play like Pep’s Barcelona and failing miserably, but the point still stands. Besides, this Arsenal side do also play some very easy on the eye football.",
      "Also, as a United fan, I started the season with the uncomfortable realisation that it was Liverpool, City or Arsenal for the title, and as such only one vaguely palatable option. Sure, Liverpool seem to have messed it up and City are hardly flying (although if they are in touching distance come Christmas then watch out), but Arsenal were and are the least bad (realistic) option from a United perspective.\nJack (Very quickly falling in love with Mbeumo) Manchester",

You’re shit and you know you are.",

      "Defeating two of your bogey teams in the same week is certainly good cause for getting excited. Dispelling the hoodoo of not winning at Anfield for 10 years then getting a win against a team that we’d lost 6 of the last 7 to has rightly given United fans and hopefully the team a nice lift. However, as a fairly staunch Amorim advocate I think we need to hold off on the ‘we told you so’ rhetoric to those who wanted him sacked.",
      "Firstly, it not like they didn’t have good reason. The team have been awful at times and Amorim is certainly accountable for a portion of that. Given the last year’s worth of evidence thinking a change of manager is needed wasn’t an unreasonable position to take. Also, United still haven’t won a game in the way the manager ideally wants so it’s difficult to point at these results and say ‘look how well it’s working’.",
      "Against Liverpool we had significantly less possession. Against Brighton 70% of the shots were on target. Across both games we ended up scoring 6 goals from an xG of about 2.6. There was definitely an element of making the most of the chances we created and setting up to counter the opponent, both of which won’t work every time.",
      "Having said that the underlying attacking numbers for this season are really positive. 1st for shots on target, 2nd for total shots attempted, and 3rd for shots in the box. 14 non penalty goals from a non penalty xG of 14.3 shows we’re performing as expected and this is backed up by a shot conversion rate of 45% and goal conversion of 11% both of which are fairly average and thus hopefully sustainable.",
      "The defending numbers still show plenty of room for improvement. Being 15th for goals conceded and 16th for xG conceded looks worrying but this is somewhat distorted by having played both City and Liverpool away from home (accounting for about 40% of that xGc total). Sitting 7th for total shots conceded is probably a more reliable indicator for our defensive performance so far which is probably about where we’ll end up.",
      "Whilst the team have looked better in the last few weeks the style of play hasn’t changed significantly all season. Amorim may have decided to be a little more pragmatic and more training times seem to be helping but a lot of the improvement in attack has come from buying significantly better attackers. There still isn’t a settled effective system for winning games and the only win achieved whilst dominating possession was against Burnley which ended up too close for comfort anyway.",
      "I’m cautiously optimistic for the rest of this season and looking ahead to the next. Stats, performance, and confidence are all trending upwards, albeit slowly. Yet don’t be despondent if we look awful again in the next game, that’s what it will be like for a while yet, patchy and inconsistent. With a few more points some good will in the bank it will be interesting to see over the next set of games if Amorim returns to his high possession model or sticks with a more opponent specific approach.\nDave, Manchester (4 more wins by Christmas and I’m happy)",

Certainly the coverage and VAR replays seem to suggest if said goalkeeper touches the ball in any way, that absolves them of any subsequent impact. Certainly the reference to Taylor’s masterclass on Saturday is the same: there is no doubt whatsoever that Amad is not just fouled but fouled so hard the defender gets up rubbing his shin, but because the ball maybe came into the area of his studs, no foul.",
      "My point is simply this: that’s not the rule right? Just because you touch the ball, you do not have carte blanche to kick a player? In the Amad case, sure maybe the defender touched the ball but he didn’t change the path and Amad is now past him with a shot on goal, if not being taken out completely. Same with most of the goalie situations – maybe they touched it but the striker is now past them and still able to get the ball if not for being flipped into the air.\nRyan, Bermuda (winning a game involving Taylor AND Oliver should count for 6 points)",

      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Has the Premier League entered an era of chaos? Last season should have been a clue, and here are 10 things about this season that make no sense.",
      "Liverpool will be back, but there will be some casualties of their rebuild (seven, to be exact) with Arne Slot and Mo Salah among those in danger…",
      "As Exeter City fans chant “we own our football club”, they are not indulging in hyperbole: they mean it.",
      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "It feels sub-optimal for your manager to openly admit ‘we have not found an answer yet’ to a problem which Liverpool will keep facing this season."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has laughed off speculation that Man Utd could sign Aleksandar Pavlovic from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils started off the season in similar fashion to an inconsistent 2024/25 campaign, which saw them finish 15th in Ruben Amorim’s first term at the club.",
      "However, Amorim – who has been under lots of pressure – seems like he could be turning it around at Old Trafford with Man Utd winning three matches in a row.",
      "Victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have the Red Devils looking up with Amorim’s side now sixth in the Premier League after nine games.",
      "And now Man Utd are turning their attention towards the next couple of transfer windows as they look to provide Amorim with further reinforcements after spending over £200m on five new players in the summer.",
      "One player who has been linked in recent weeks is Bayern Munich defensive midfielder Pavlovic but Romano has dismissed any suggestion that he could be joining Man Utd anytime soon.",
      "READ: Liverpool in ‘transition season’ as VVD ‘declines into Lovren’; Man Utd ‘hope cannot be allowed to fester’",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Pavlovic, guys, I can guarantee to you that there is nothing, absolutely nothing ongoing. Pavlovic is a crucial player for Bayern, he’s more than happy at Bayern.",
      "“Bayern – and when I say Bayern it’s the board of directors, but also the most important people at Bayern like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Uli Hoeness and all the others – they all see Pavlovic as one of the crucial faces of the project for present and future.",
      "“So there is nothing between Pavlovic and Manchester United. I don’t know where this news is coming from but Bayern will NOT sell Pavlovic. So forget about it.”",
      "Man Utd are looking to sign at least one midfielder in the next couple of transfer windows and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller has been confirmed as a target by Romano.",
      "Romano said last week: “I’m always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller. There was a report from Bild in the last few days on Man Utd tracking the player. Man Utd have always been following this player. Stiller is really appreciated internally at Man Utd.",
      "“Last summer, we had some stories on Man Utd going on a mission to Germany, negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks. No, Man Utd never started any negotiations for Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility, it was always impossible.",
      "“Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August. There was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "“But Stiller remains a player monitored by Man Utd. They are following him. They are closely monitoring his progress.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo is one of the most in-form players in the Premier League this season and the Daily Telegraph has now revealed that Bournemouth ‘rejected £50m offers’ from Man Utd and Tottenham over the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘It made it easy for them to reject the overtures of United and Tottenham, with Semenyo buying into the idea and agreeing a new contract – with a pay rise – and, crucially, a release clause that his agent is able to tell other clubs about but which is not being made public.",
      "‘Semenyo has been in outstanding form with only Erling Haaland outscoring him. If he carries on like this, the 25-year-old Ghana international will not only be sold for far more than was offered but will also earn twice as much money as was proposed last summer by United and Spurs.’",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson has overtaken Roefs in the ranking despite having surprisingly little to do at Arsenal on Sunday. The Palace keeper will doubtless fancy himself as England’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. Of the ever-presents, only David Raya has conceded fewer goals.",
      "",
      "Spurs have protected him rather better of late after a busy start to the campaign. He was bloomin’ busy last season too. Two excellent saves at Everton preserved a very creditable clean sheet.",
      "",
      "‘Are you Schmeichel in disguise?’ Perhaps not, but you can understand the Stretford End’s befuddlement at the sight of some competence in their goal after so long. Even if one ex-keeper reckons he Lammens should have kept out Danny Welbeck’s free-kick. Tough crowd.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds…",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic part of a completely revamped defence. Still, though, the Cherries are second in the Premier League. Second. One off the actual top.",
      "",
      "Only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope, who has been rewarded with a place in Newcastle’s leadership group. Which is reassuring since the keeper would have been sweating on his place in the team when Eddie Howe signed Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "",
      "No keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 84.2%. Arsenal actually a allowed a shot on the Spaniard against Palace, which is more than he faced against Fulham and West Ham.",
      "",
      "One of three keepers to keep out a penalty this season, Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as England’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League, with no one having yet seized upon the fact one of the world’s best keepers is supposed to be shaky on crosses with two left feet.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener last week cut the ex-England keeper in half and Burnley’s opener took him by surprise.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray. Given Liverpool’s struggles to defend, they need Alisson back sharpish.",
      "",
      "It was handy while his side had forgotten how to score goals that Martinez was slowly making amends with Villa fans after a summer in which he flirted hard with Manchester United. Keeping a clean sheet against City improved his number here by only 0.2..",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Bournemouth’s first, from what should have been an impossibly-tight angle went through Leno but Justin Kluivert’s winner was unsaveable.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award has had a wretched couple of weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from of a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner then from around 30 yards won’t help his cause, especially with Big John breathing down his neck and Sean Dyche looking for reasons to make changes.",

      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow. Back on the bench for the big win over West Ham.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili has come into the side just as Liverpool have forgotten the basics of defending. It is perhaps too soon to judge whether or not that is a coincidence, but there have been goals for which the big Georgian has been beaten rather easily. Back on the bench as soon as Alison is fit.",

      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal did the £16million new boy no favours here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle. But five was two more than Arsenal ought to have scored at the Emirates, say the stats. Perri was back in for win over West Ham and looks set to keep his place, but the Brazilian needs to sharpen up.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",

But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",

      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",

      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",

      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",

      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Have got to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "Gary Neville has revealed that Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has another “big job over the next couple of weeks” after guiding his side to three wins in a row.",

      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Bournemouth) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Sunderland) – £45m",
      "5th (Manchester City) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Manchester United) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Liverpool) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Aston Villa) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Chelsea) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Crystal Palace) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Brentford) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Newcastle) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Brighton) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Everton) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Leeds) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Burnley) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Fulham) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Nottingham Forest) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Manchester United were the biggest winners from the initial December selections with four more games each.",
      "=1st) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester United (14 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £12.1m in 2024/25",
      "=5th) Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (13 games) – worth around £11.4m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Newcastle (12 games) – worth around £10.6m",
      "=10th) Leeds and West Ham (11 games) – worth around £9.7m",
      "=12th) Brentford and Everton (10 games) – worth around £8.9m",
      "=14th) Crystal Palace, Fulham and Wolves (9 games) – worth around £8.1m",
      "17th) Brighton (8 games) – worth around £7.3m",
      "18th) Bournemouth (7 games) – worth around £6.5m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (6 games) – worth around £5.7m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Has the Premier League entered an era of chaos? Last season should have been a clue, and here are 10 things about this season that make no sense.",
      "Liverpool will be back, but there will be some casualties of their rebuild (seven, to be exact) with Arne Slot and Mo Salah among those in danger…",
      "As Exeter City fans chant “we own our football club”, they are not indulging in hyperbole: they mean it.",
      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "It feels sub-optimal for your manager to openly admit ‘we have not found an answer yet’ to a problem which Liverpool will keep facing this season."

      "The Red Devils have been flexing their muscles in recent weeks with a victory over the Seagulls this weekend taking their run of wins to three in a row.",
      "Man Utd had been struggling at the beginning of the season to stay consistent with their victory over arch-rivals Liverpool last weekend seeing them achieve back-to-back wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s reign.",
      "Hargreaves thinks Man Utd have been unlucky in some matches this season, picking out the Arsenal defeat as an example, and he was pleased to see Cunha scoring in their win over Brighton at the weekend.",

      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville has revealed that Ruben Amorim has another “big job over the next couple of weeks” after guiding the Red Devils to three wins in a row.",
      "The Red Devils won their first back-to-back Premier League matches under Amorim when they beat Liverpool last weekend and their 4-2 win over Brighton on Saturday saw them take that run of victories to three on the bounce.",
      "Amorim has spent much of this season under pressure but those three wins saw them fly above defending champions Liverpool in the table and into fourth position.",
      "And Neville has hailed it as Amorim’s “best week in the job” but warns the Man Utd head coach that he’s “not out of the woods yet”.",
      "“I think where we’ve all been with it, I wouldn’t have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",

      "“They’ll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they’ll end up in sixth or seventh but that’s where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "“So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "“A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn’t believe in Ruben Amorim’s system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "“However, one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "“Because I think there’s no doubt he’s not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they’re desperate to win and you’ve seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "“I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There’s still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "“It feels very different, it feels like the momentum’s with them a little bit and the spirit’s good.”",
      "Neville reckons Amorim still needs to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko over the next couple of weeks with Mbeumo and Cunha now firing.",
      "The Man Utd legend added: “There’s question marks over Sesko. I think he was a bigger risk as a signing. It doesn’t look like he’s quite settled in yet. It would be nice if it could start to look like a front three. It still feels like a front two, with him stood up there. I think that’s the big job over the next couple of weeks.",
      "“It’s more than the goals; it’s the inclusion within the combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, who wasn’t playing today, linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha. You don’t quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet.",
      "“He’s not got up to the pace of it, with how quickly they’re playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed and that will only come through time. Obviously, he’s still quite young but he just needs to get there.",
      "“He’s a big signing, and if they can become a front three, that will be huge. It still feels like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.”",

      "A lot of criticism will deservedly be levelled at Slot. Mo, Kerkez and others were all poor but he chose the team and, astoundingly, chose to leave Mo on the pitch when he made his subs. He also somehow saw that joke first half and waited until 60 minutes and 3-1 down to make changes.",
      "Credit to Brentford and Henderson. We were made to look pathetic tonight and they didn’t low block. They didn’t need to to absolutely dominate us.",
      "Looking at the fixture list no game looks certain in the next month. 4 more losses in a row (Palace, Villa, Madrid and Man City up next) doesn’t see unrealistic right now and Slot might end up sacked which would be kind of wild after last season.\nMinty, LFC",

      "Yet again, for the 427th time this season, Liverpool scored long after the indicated allotted level of injury time and, I think we can all agree, the amount of Fergie time being afforded to them is simply unprecedented. The ref was too embarrassed to even come out for the second half, and so we got another numerically illiterate official in his place. Who then provided the first instance, in my memory anyway (somebody fact-check that for me), of a team being awarded a corner because the GK held onto the ball too long (more than 8 seconds).",
      "The ref is supposed to provide a visual countdown with his fingers for the last 5 seconds. Watch it back, the GK gets rid around 7/8 seconds and the players complain he wasn’t given proper visual warning by the ref. Bear in mind Brentford did a lot more time wasting against United and weren’t punished in the same manner.

So what can we do to address this current timekeeping debacle you ask? Either all stoppages are clear and transparent, with a specific clock for stoppages that all can see, or the current team of officials should be sent back to primary school to learn how to count and how to tell the time. (There is a third option of not allowing Liverpool any injury time unless they have a narrow lead, but we’ll hold that one back for now to see how things shake out).",
      "The irony of course is that the back-pass rule was basically invented due to Liverpool wasting time, passing the ball between CBs and GK once they had any sort of a lead (somebody fact-check that for me please). Hansen to Grobbelaar again is it? Not on my watch! We need more of that spirit in officialdom and strive to get back to a time when refs favoured the likes of United (as if they ever did).",

      "Manchester United are being linked with midfielder after midfielder, making it increasingly unclear what type of player Ruben Amorim actually wants to sign.",
      "Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand is a player Man Utd have reportedly been tracking for some time, and his name has been thrown in the mix once again by Portuguese outlet Record (via Sport Witness).",
      "The report claims that Man Utd and Man City are both interested in signing Hjulmand, with a ‘January transfer battle’ on the cards.",
      "His form has unsurprisingly ‘caught the attention’ of the Manchester giants and they are ‘following him closely’ ahead of the winter window.",
      "Both clubs have links to Sporting through United boss Amorim and City’s director of football Hugo Viana, which means they both know the 26-year-old well — and that it’s a very easy transfer rumour to make up.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas said there was interest in the summer and that Hjulmand turned down offers to ‘triple his salary’, but the report claims that January could present him with ‘headaches’ as City and United ‘promise’ to move for the midfielder.",
      "Hjulmand will reportedly pick up a loyalty bonus if he stays at Sporting until the end of the season, and the Portuguese club are adamant they won’t negotiate below his €80m (£69.8m) release clause.",
      "On Friday, we covered a story from Fichajes linking Athletic Club’s Oihan Sancet, and another from talkSPORT linking six other midfielders with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Surprisingly, Hjulmand’s name wasn’t mentioned by the latter, which claimed Man Utd are open to signing two midfielders in 2026 — with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Chelsea’s Andrey Santos, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller all appreciated.",
      "Hjulmand, a long-time target, becomes the eighth player added to Amorim’s midfield shortlist.",
      "The quantity of midfield targets proves that Man Utd are serious about strengthening in that area — but the quality and variety is confusing.",
      "The fact that Man Utd are reportedly considering signing two midfielders is a caveat, but the different profiles being linked with the Red Devils either shows they don’t know what they want — or that those reporting are just guessing. Or both. Definitely both.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has the ability to drop deep and dictate the tempo, but he’s wasted in those areas. United need him further up the pitch because he’s the most reliable goalscorer and creator Amorim has in his squad.",
      "What he doesn’t have are the defensive capabilities. He’s nothing like a prime Casemiro — the kind Amorim wishes he had — and he’s not a Patrick Vieira type who bombs up and down the pitch, winning tackles and making interceptions.",
      "With Fernandes an undisputed starter in Amorim’s midfield two, it’s clear the Portuguese boss needs a much more industrious player alongside him. Literally, if Casemiro were five years younger…",
      "There will be no unearthing of hidden gems like United almost managed with Moises Caicedo. Unknown quantities like Baleba and Santos — or under-the-radar Premier League and Championship ballers like Anderson and Wharton — are now commanding fees in a completely different stratosphere to what their current clubs paid.",
      "Stiller and Santos are similar in that they can play as a No.6, 8, or 10, but their best role isn’t what United need to become more defensively stable and get the best out of Fernandes.",
      "Gallagher is similar, but everyone knows what you’ll get from him: energy. The guy has an unparalleled engine and is a manager’s dream. But is he someone with the ability to dictate tempo and provide the defensive output required for Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system? Probably not.",
      "Baleba, Wharton and Anderson are all Premier League-proven and the right profile for Man Utd. Brighton midfielder Baleba is the perfect signing for me, Clive.",
      "Hjulmand is similar but lacks Premier League experience. He might be the most attractive signing of all eight players, but there’s no way United should be paying £70m.",
      "And then Sancet barely deserves a mention. He’s an attacking midfielder — and the source is, well, sh**.",
      "We all know Baleba will be the guy United sign at the end of the season. He’s going to cost around £100m, though. And knowing Man Utd, they won’t hesitate to pay it."

Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",

      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",

      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "Following a third consecutive victory, Gary Neville believes Manchester United have the pieces in place for a top-six finish. Ruben Amorim has come through his month of reckoning but there are still question marks over Benjamin Sesko after Brighton win...",
      "Saturday 25 October 2025 22:19, UK",
      "Gary Neville has declared this to be Ruben Amorim's best week in the job after Manchester United made it three wins in a row in the Premier League with a 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday and believes the template is there for a top-six finish.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
      "\"That's the big job over the next couple of weeks.\"",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",
