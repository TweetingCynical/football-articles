      "Ruben Amorim claimed he had dropped Joshua Zirkzee for tactical reasons after the striker became the glaring omission for Manchester United's Premier League game against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Zirkzee started and scored in the 1-1 draw against Wolves, but has been relegated to the substitutes' bench at Elland Road, despite United being short of players. Amorim is without Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt through injury, while Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim opted to start against Leeds with six defenders and two holding midfielders. Patrick Dorgu has been pushed up the field to play as one of the No.10s in United's 3-4-2-1 formation, with Luke Shaw at left wing-back and Benjamin Sesko leading the line.",
      "Zirkzee's omission is hardly a ringing endorsement of the Dutch forward, who is one of three senior players a heavily depleted bench alongside back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and defender Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Zirkzee scored with a deflected effort against Wolves to net his second goal in 13 appearances across all competitions. He has struggled since joining from Bologna for £36.5million in 2024 and has been heavily linked with a move in the January transfer window.",
      "The 24-year-old has agreed to join Roma, according to reports in Italy. He has reportedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by manager Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether United would sanction the move, given their current injury and AFCON crisis. Amorim has been clear that United will not be busy in January and has vetoed an exit for Mainoo to Napoli.",
      "“The transfer window is not going to change,” Amorim said. “We have no conversation at this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.”",
      "Asked about his lack of options before the trip to Elland Road, Amorim said: “It was bad luck to lose Amad, Bryan, especially with Bruno. If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle.",
      "“You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it’s clear.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Spain and Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos has turned down a move to Paris FC, it has been claimed. The veteran is a free agent after leaving Monterrey at the end of last year and a return to Europe is thought to be his preference.",
      "Ramos previously spent two years in the French capital with Paris Saint-Germain, winning back-to-back Ligue 1 titles. Noisy neighbours Paris FC have been ambitious since coming up to the top flight, signing players including former PSG keeper Kevin Trapp and France international Jonathan Ikone, but it now looks unlikely Ramos' name will join the list.",
      "According to Foot Mercato (via GFFN), owners the Arnault family are keen on adding experience to the squad, with Ramos' name reportedly considered internally. However, the Spaniard is not believed to have any plans of joining the newly promoted side.",
      "Manchester United had also been linked with the 39-year-old, who was a four-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid. Those links were quickly played down, though, with ESPN reporting in December that he doesn't fit the age profile of the kind of player United want.",
      "There were firmer links between United and Ramos in 2015, and the player addressed those in 2023 after moving from PSG back to boyhood club Sevilla. \"I stayed where I should have stayed, Real Madrid, but I was indeed close to playing for United,\" he said.",
      "\"It was not to be, but I do keep that admiration for the club, to the Premier League and the players, because the rhythm of play, the pace is different, and it's a league we can all learn a great deal from, all of us. So that was not meant to be. I was glad to stay in Madrid, and now I'm glad to be in Sevilla.\"",
      "Another of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's clubs, Nice, have also been linked with a January move for Ramos. However, those rumours were quickly shot down by the club's president Jean-Pierre Rivere.",
      "“Sergio Ramos is not on our radar, that’s not the case,\" Rivere told reporters. “ I don’t remember if we were in contact at some point or not… maybe. But he’s not on our radar, that’s not the case.\"",
      "Nice have been active already during the window, with Elye Wahi scoring on his debut after signing on loan from Eintracht Frankrurt, but any further business wouldn't involve Ramos. \"We’re working on the transfer window, we don’t have to sign big names. We have to be consistent. Elye Wahi is already a big name,\" the president added.",

The Red Devils are preparing to face Leeds United with the club in sixth position, three points from the top four and three points clear of Fulham in 12th. United have failed to be wholly convincing this term, despite having no European football.",
      "The club were linked with a move for Bournemouth ace Antoine Semenyo, but the winger is set to join Manchester City instead. The prospect of another move in January looks unlikely for now.",
      "Before his team's Sunday fixture against Leeds, Amorim was asked for greater insight into the comments he made ahead of the win over Newcastle. However, the 40-year-old did not appear entirely happy with the situation and gave little away despite repeated questioning.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen. So, maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "But the Portuguese coach offered little when quizzed on his transfer comments. \"I don't want to talk about that,\" he said. \"I just focus on the Leeds game.\"",
      "Amorim said he did not regret his comments and was then asked if anything had changed regarding the transfer budget he'd expected. \"I don't want to talk about that,\" came the reply. After a short pause, Amorim added: \"But you are very smart, so...\"",
      "Amorim said in December that he sometimes has 'another idea' than director of football Jason Wilcox when it comes to recruitment. he added that 'common ground' must be found before any incoming arrivals.",

      "United spent big in the summer to replenish Amorim's frontline. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko arrived in deals worth more than £200million.",

      "Manchester United youngster Harry Amass is reportedly contemplating spending the second half of the season with Stoke City. The left-back is currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, but could end up trading a relegation battle for a promotion push with the Potters.",
      "Amass, 18, joined United from Watford in 2023 and made his debut under Amorim in March. He made five Premier League appearances last term, also playing twice in the Europa League, but was allowed to move to Hillsborough for a taste of first team football this term.",
      "The young defender hit back at comments from Amorim that he was \"struggling\", posting a photo of himself with Wednesday's player of the month award. However, he later deleted the comment as it was clarified that the 'struggling' depiction was related to the Owls' lowly league position.",
      "\"I think is the feeling of entitlement that we have in our club,\" Amorim said after Amass and fellow youngster Chido Obi reacted to his comments. \"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids.\"",
      "He added: \"I didn't say anything wrong. I just spoke about how the luck of playing for Manchester United. Sometimes you play for Manchester United and you go see different realities and you understand that football can be so different and that you are really lucky to be in Manchester United.\"",
      "Wednesday have been hit with two separate points deductions to make relegation to the third tier all but a formality. They still have a negative points tally after seeing 18 points taken off their total after entering administration and then getting a second deduction for breaches under former owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "They sit some 32 points from safety ahead of Sunday's trip to QPR, with relegation all but a formality. Amass has impressed in his short time at Hillsborough, though, and has no shortage of suitors.",
      "According to The Sun, Stoke appear to be the most likely winners after a 12-way fight for Amass' signature. They report United won't be recalling the defender, though Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen remains hopeful of keeping him for the second half of the campaign.",
      "\"There is a dialogue between the clubs and the agent, so I really hope that we can finalise something soon,\" Pedersen told reporters. \"Of course, we would love to keep him.",
      "\"He has done really, really well. He's 18-years-old, played so many games, which level he has played [at]. Of course the young guy has a lot to learn, but how he has played for us, it has been great.\"",
      "If Amass does choose Stoke, he would be joining a team with a realistic chance of promotion for the first time since dropping out of the Premier League in 2018. Stoke haven't even finished in the top half of the Championship in any of the last seven seasons.",
      "It's their first full campaign with Mark Robins in the dugout and they have the best defensive record in the league with just 23 goals conceded. They sit ninth in the table ahead of Sunday's meeting with Norwich City but are just three points adrift of the play-off places.",

      "Manchester United can spend £100million in the January transfer window without getting into financial difficulty, according to a football finance expert. With United pushing for Champions League qualification this season, a lot has been said about their need to bolster their ranks in the transfer market, which remains open until early February.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has already made it clear the club won't bring in players unless there is 'common ground' with director of football Jason Wilcox about which players can improve the squad, admitting that the pair don't always agree when it comes to new signings.",
      "United already appear to have missed out on highly-rated winger Antoine Semenyo, who is set to join rivals Manchester City from Bournemouth. For the most part, the other players linked with the Old Trafford club have been midfielders, including the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Conor Gallagher.",
      "Whether United are active in January will also be influenced by their financial situation. There has been plenty of talk about how much they are actually able to spend on new additions, given owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's status as one of Britain's richest men with an estimated net worth of £12billion.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has painted the picture of a financial crisis at United since acquiring a minority stake in the club in February 2024, worsened by the absence of European football this season. During Ratcliffe's short reign, United have axed hundreds of club employees and increased ticket prices in a bid to maintain the team's competitiveness on the field by bankrolling significant spending on forwards last summer.",
      "But United also recorded the highest EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) profit of any Premier League club, along with the second highest revenues, in 2023-24.",
      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire insists they do not require any January sales to finance further transfers, saying they are “fine as they are” financially. He believes offloading players such as Kobbie Mainoo would only provide additional funds to decrease their overdraft debt, reported to stand at around £748million, while their transfer budget of around £100m this month would remain the same.",
      "Maguire said: “I think the broader issue is they've not got cup money coming this year, they've not got European money. Old Trafford, you're looking to make probably seven or eight million per match, because it's very noticeable that since Ineos took over, the prices have gone up substantially.",
      "“So they're squeezing the fans, and I think that's why the fans are probably a bit more demanding now than they were originally when Ineos came in, because they are being milked in order to provide the budget.",
      "“Again, from an SCR point of view, which is the new rules which are kicking in, they're spending around half their revenue on wages. So they've got huge capacity.",
      "“It's then a case of, can they spend the money? Well, yes, they've got a lot of debt but they're still well within their overdraft limit. What Manchester United tend to do is to buy players on credit. So they owe £466m in outstanding transfer fees for players that they've signed in the past.",
      "“I think that's more of an issue for the summer of 2026 rather than January. If they spend £100m in January, they'll be spreading that over three or four years. So from a cash point of view, it's not really going to make a difference.",
      "“If that's the difference between Champions League and not Champions League, they've got to go for it if it's going to improve the squad. Because a good run in the Champions League, you've got four home matches guaranteed, potentially another three. So you've got seven home matches.",
      "“If you're in the playoffs, that's eight home matches. For Manchester United, you're looking at £60m. That's just from your ticket receipts.",
      "“If you get to the quarters or semi-finals, you'll make another £60m from TV money. And then your sponsors will be paying bonuses on top of that. So there's no reason why Manchester United can't make £150m if they get to the final.",
      "“If they win it, that means they qualify for the Club World Cup in 2029. It's worth £200m. But it's Champions League or nothing. Europa League is okay for a club the size of Manchester United. The conference, certainly for the smaller clubs, they lose money in the conference.”",
      "Based on this information, it would be wise for owners Ineos, the club hierarchy and Amorim to spend well on incoming players this January if it adds quality squad depth and aids their push for Champions League qualification for next season, given the greater financial benefits on offer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that their big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet. Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad, and Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all targets.",
      "Former United coach Rene Meulensteen recently told his old club to make Crystal Palace star Wharton their top target next summer. He said: \"I'm a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer.",
      "\"He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don't think the move will be possible until next summer. He's got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "\"He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He's great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "\"His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It's an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.\"",
      "Asked about his club's plans for the winter window on Friday, United boss Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change.",
      "\"We have no conversations in this moment to have any change in the squad. There's a process, there's an idea that is going to continue.",
      "\"We are near the places of the Champions League, but we are near also for like eight teams behind us so let's focus on the next game. Just that. Our focus is to win the next game.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's tactics have been under the microscope due to on-pitch performances, but one particular incident this season prompted the club's hierarchy to take action.",
      "Amorim was appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor at Old Trafford in November 2024, but his tenure has been anything but smooth sailing. The Red Devils finished a disappointing 15th in the Premier League in the 2024/25 season and suffered defeat at the hands of Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "This season has brought a glimmer of hope, despite an early Carabao Cup exit on penalties to Grimsby Town in August. Currently sitting sixth in the league and just three points shy of the top four, Champions League qualification is a realistic aim for this campaign.",
      "Despite a slight upturn in results, performances continue to be a cause for concern. Amorim has staunchly defended his 3-4-3 system, which he also employed at Sporting CP, but there was a significant tactical shift last month when United hosted Bournemouth at Old Trafford.",
      "However, if reports are accurate, the eventual shift in tactics stemmed from United's top brass believing the team needed to adopt a less predictable approach, triggered by remarks from rival teams. A weekend report from the Daily Mail reveals how a 1-1 stalemate against Fulham in August, where Amorim's side took an early lead only to concede a late leveller, left senior figures feeling frustrated.",
      "Post-match observations from Marco Silva and Fulham's Alex Iwobi proved particularly worrying for United's leadership, including director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who allegedly circulated the quotes in a WhatsApp group with other staff members.",
      "\"We knew how they defend and we know they like to squeeze from the back five,\" the Fulham manager revealed afterwards. \"And if you don't give bodies for them to squeeze from the back five you can create superiority in the middle.",
      "\"We know they play with two in the middle, we tried to overload with our three plus Alex [Iwobi]. It was as simple as that.\"",
      "Iwobi then remarked during a television interview: \"We knew that we would be able to get behind their two midfielders and that their centre backs would want to jump – we exploited that today.\"",
      "United and Amorim maintained a four-at-the-back formation in their narrow 1-0 victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to previous tactics in a disappointing 1-1 draw against bottom-of-the-league Wolves. The Red Devils' next match is on Sunday afternoon when they head off to face rivals Leeds United.",
      "This is followed by an away game against Burnley and a third-round FA Cup tie with Brighton. However, all eyes are on the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on 17 January.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's priority is to sign up to two 'top' central midfielders in the next 12 months and the club have 'explored' a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba for a second time.",
      "The Seagulls plan to keep hold of the midfielder until at least the summer transfer window. Baleba is under contract until 2028, and his deal has the option for a one-year extension.",
      "The report claims that Brighton's star is one of six players currently of interest to United. Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Wolves' Joao Gomes are all on the club's shortlist and would command a significant fee.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side also have younger prospects on their agenda in Lille's Ayyoub Bouaddi and Olympiakos' Christos Mouzakitis. The club are expected to make a move this month if a unique market opportunity arises.",
      "United boss Amorim is expecting a quiet January, however. The 40-year-old played down any prospects of deals during his press conference ahead of Leeds.",
      "\"The transfer window is not going to change,\" said Amorim on Friday. \"We have no conversations at this moment to have any change in the squad.",

      "\"No, none have asked. I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything,\" Amorim added when questioned about wantaway stars.",
      "United are in transfer talks over the future of Harry Amass, however. The youngster is currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday but could play his final game for the Championship side this weekend.",
      "The Owls want to extend his move until the end of the season. Stoke and Millwall have been named as two of 12 clubs that have expressed an interest in landing Amass in January as competition heats up.",

      "One would think anyone boasting five Premier League titles and a pair of Champions League winners' medals would be financially secure for life. Yet former Manchester United star Wes Brown discovered just how rapidly fortunes can change.",
      "Football supporters were stunned when the 23-cap former England international declared bankruptcy in 2023. Brown was part of Sir Alex Ferguson's most iconic era and the historic treble-winning side of 1999, even providing an assist to Cristiano Ronaldo during the 2008 Champions League final victory against Chelsea.",
      "Yet a series of poor investments coupled with insufficient guidance on managing his wealth sent Brown spiralling into financial difficulty. Despite pocketing as much as £50,000 per week during his playing days, he found himself desperately trying to raise cash after hanging up his boots.",
      "The 46-year-old is now in a far better position and has navigated through the worst of his money troubles. Brown has been refreshingly honest about his experience and how his broadcasting work alongside various other ventures enabled him to overcome what he called \"a tough ride.\"",
      "\"Well luckily I still work, so that's good,\" he told William Hill in November 2024. \"But it's all been sorted now in the sense that I know what I need to do and everybody is happy with everything. So I'm just getting on with it now and carrying on really.",
      "\"It was a tough ride, it's something that is hard to deal with on your own at times. But luckily I still do quite a lot of work and I'm able to carry on now moving forward. Today I'm one more day out of it.\"",
      "Brown kept quiet about his bankruptcy petition from HMRC for 12 months after it became public knowledge. However, he eventually reached a place where he was able to open up about the difficult period.",
      "In total, the retired defender bagged 11 major trophies during his 15-year stint as part of United's first team. Brown first joined the club's academy at age 12 and later became one of only two players to have won the Jimmy Murphy Player of the Year award on two occasions (Ryan Giggs being the other).",
      "Brown has since focused on educating athletes on financial literacy and due diligence, something he has suggested was lacking at the peak of his own football fame.",
      "\"For me it was more of a case of not knowing who I could speak to about stuff,\" he continued. \"Sometimes it's just a feeling of, 'I'm not sure that was the right thing to do.' But then you leave it, you sort of forget about yourself, and then something pops up about it.",
      "\"But I always feel if I could have the time again I would have more people in the room, and would have taken advice from people. But that wasn't available at the time. If anything, with that you get the pros and cons, and I feel that's much easier doing when you've got people you trust in the room.\"",
      "Brown is not the only athlete to face financial difficulties post-playing career. Liverpool legend John Barnes has encountered numerous bankruptcy petitions over the years, with the most recent one surfacing last year due to unpaid debts amounting to £1.5million.",
      "Ex-Manchester City star Trevor Sinclair was also declared bankrupt in June 2025 after failing to settle a tax bill exceeding £36,000.",

      "McIlroy appeared as a guest on episode 109 of Stick to Football, which they recorded during December after United's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth. Gary Neville called the golfer a \"big fan\" and asked him about his team.",
      "McIlroy said: \"The last game I went to watch live was that Europa League final in Bilbao. I was sitting there going: 'What did you expect? It's the 16th and 17th team in the Premier League, of course it was going to be like this.'",
      "\"But it's better. They look good going forward, but they're still fragile at the back, conceding four goals at home on Monday. I'm much more optimistic than I would have been 12 months ago, but I still think there's a lot of work to be done.\"",
      "After finally winning the Masters in April, there was talk of McIlroy taking to the Old Trafford pitch with his Green Jacket. Asked whether he would during his winners' press conference at Augusta, the Northern Irishman said: \"If I can inspire some better play, absolutely.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim also extended McIlroy an open invitation in a video message recorded at Carrington. \"Hi Rory,\" he began.",

      "\"You achieved something that a lot of people thought would be impossible, and we want that feeling in our stadium. So, I hope to see you soon at Old Trafford and to meet you.\"",
      "Amorim is still waiting for that meeting of minds, and Louis van Gaal was in charge when McIlroy last paraded a trophy around at a United match. It was the Dutchman's first match and the opening game of the 2014/15 Premier League season against Swansea City, which the visitors won 2-1.",
      "The Sun asked McIlory about visiting Old Trafford after he won Sports Personality of the Year in Manchester. They dubbed his latest award \"another trophy to take to Old Trafford\", the golfer replied: \"Yeah, maybe, as long as they stop conceding four goals at home.\"",
      "He told them the last match he attended was the Europa League final and said: \"I was like, 'why did I fly all this way to watch this?'\" McIlroy then added: \"But they're getting better, there are a few encouraging signs, there's a little bit of optimism around.\"",

      "Liverpool's £450million transfer outlay last summer has done little to interrupt Manchester United's top position when it comes to net spend for the past five years. Net spend - which is defined as \"transfer fees spent on acquiring players minus transfer fees received on moving players out\" - is a term that is routinely bandied about in football.",
      "The Red Devils are regular big spenders in the transfer window and routinely rank among the biggest recruiters in world football. However, their sizeable expenditure is rarely matched by profit earned from outgoings - quite the contrast from the current Premier League champions.",
      "It's closing in on 13 years since United last captured the Premier League crown but a five-year span beginning in the summer of 2021 has Ruben Amorim's side as the undisputed leader of the net spend table.",
      "Their total net spend has come to £-684.61million, which is just -£10m less than second-place Arsenal who've accrued a figure of £-675.77m. It's Chelsea up next with the Blues' net spend total coming in at £-662.04m, as despite spending over £1bn since Todd Boehly's arrival, they've earned huge transfer fees from outgoings in recent years",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are the next club up with their net spend total in the last five years totalling £-569.24m despite their last top four finish coming in the 2021/22 season. That was coincidentally their lowest net spend total across the five-year span.",
      "Rounding out the top five is Newcastle United with a total of £-430.61m - a figure that was certainly bolstered last summer by the British record £125m sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool. The Reds' position of sixth on this list with a £-426.77m net spend certainly calls to their cleverness when it comes to arrivals and outgoings.",
      "In their maiden Premier League title win in the 2019/20 season, Liverpool actually boasted a positive net spend of £29.14m that campaign, given Takumi Minamino's £7.25m signing in January was their biggest across the summer and winter windows.",
      "Their figure of £-228.6m this past summer tells a different story in what was their biggest transfer window ever, and by some distance. The club broke their record transfer twice, first with the £100m acquisition of Florian Wirtz and again a month later by signing Isak.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In the case of United's £-154.34m figure last summer - their second-highest total for five years - a majority of their transfer dealings were built around transforming their forward line. Almost £200m was spent on acquiring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Just when Ruben Amorim needed some comfort and solace, the Manchester United manager has been left reaching for his tin hat instead.",
      "Because Amorim won't get a warm welcome at Elland Road on Sunday. The Portuguese will get a red hot one instead, filled with the sort of poison and spite Sir Alex Ferguson could never quite understand.",
      "Unless Amorim has been living under a rock, he should be aware of the genuine hatred that exists between United and Leeds. Both might have 'United' in their names - but nothing could be further from the truth. This will be Amorim's first trip to Elland Road since taking charge of United - and nothing can quite prepare him for what lies in wait.",
      "Not least because he travels to Yorkshire at a time when Leeds are full of confidence as well as adrenaline, following a six game unbeaten run which incudes a home thumping of Chelsea and two draws with Liverpool, including a point from their midweek trip to Anfield.",
      "The game is kicking off at 12.30pm on Sunday for a reason. To limit the amount of time both sets of supporters have to indulge in alcohol. It has become the norm for West Yorkshire Police to cancel all leave and have extra officers patrolling the game. Senior figures from both clubs have been known to meet with police in the past to discuss security measures.",
      "While former United chief executive Ed Woodward once considered not attending a game at Elland Road, because he genuinely feared for his safety. If this isn't enough to leave Amorim bracing himself for a cauldron of hate, he should consider what Fergie once said about the rivalry between United and Leeds.",
      "Back in 2011, ahead of a Carling Cup game at Elland Road, a large group of Leeds fans congregated outside the United team hotel in the city centre. The atmosphere became so toxic, Fergie was scared to leave the building.",
      "And he reckoned the vitriol between both sets of supporters even exceeded the levels which existed between United and Liverpool. Fergie said: \"Historically, it has been there for a long time. I have always said Liverpool-Manchester United games are fierce in many aspects.",
      "\"Sometimes supporters can play a bad part in that particular game. But it never reaches the levels of Leeds United. Never. It was frightening at our hotel. We had seven police vans round the hotel protecting the team. I don't know why it is like that. I don't understand it. But it is there and it is not nice.\"",
      "The hatred is historical, due to geography and the envy of supporters of different generations towards the respective clubs' successes. Leeds, who have no such rivalry with another Yorkshire club, dominated the 1970s while United ruled the roost in the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Leeds supporters have spent decades taunting United about the 1958 Munich air crash, while in more recent times United fans have goaded Leeds about the two fans who got murdered in Istanbul in 2000. Now Leeds are back in the Premier League, football's long-standing 'War of the Roses' will resume once again.",
      "And Amorim will head across the Pennines to find himself on the frontline of the kind of battle he has never come close to experiencing before.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will be hoping to get back to winning ways when they face old rivals Leeds United on Sunday. The Red Devils have endured an up-and-down run of form over Christmas, with one win, a draw and a loss in their last three games.",
      "After a tough 2-1 away defeat to Aston Villa in mid-December, Ruben Amorim's side looked to have turned the tide with a Boxing Day victory against Newcastle, which continued their impressive festive record. However, a 1-1 draw with bottom-placed Wolves – who picked up just their third point of the season in the draw at Old Trafford – derailed United's momentum.",
      "It's Leeds up next on Sunday, before a visit to Burnley and an FA Cup third round tie against Brighton. Then it's the small matter of back-to-back games against Manchester City and Arsenal as the Red Devils look to kick on up the table.",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that there aren't any plans for United to make changes in the January transfer window. The Portuguese boss spoke ahead of the Leeds showdown and admits his team are in a good place - but things can change quickly.",
      "Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation to have any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea - that is going to continue.",
      "\"We are near places of the Champions League but we are also near eight teams behind us.\"",
      "When asked if any current United player has requested to leave, the 40-year-old shut down the notion of any planned departures.",
      "He added: \"No, none of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is adamant he will be successful at Manchester United despite reports linking him to an Old Trafford exit. The academy star made an incredible start to his career at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag but his relationship with Amorim has not been the same.",
      "According to The Sun, the working relationship between Mainoo’s camp and Amorim was strained even before the midfielder’s half-brother wore a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ T-shirt at Old Trafford in December 2025.",
      "Despite this - and links to other clubs - Mainoo made something of a U-turn and is determined to revive his United career. Amorim has made it clear the 20-year-old is going nowhere, having blocked the chance of a loan move last summer and now confirmed that he doesn't plan on losing any of his squad in January.",
      "Mainoo will hope to gain important minutes upon his return from injury as England gear up for the World Cup in the summer. The midfielder may see a route to Thomas Tuchel's squad if he can somehow force his way into Amorim's plans during the second half of the season.",

      "Manchester United are 'exploring' a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. The Red Devils have maintained an interest in the 21-year-old since last summer.",
      "The £100million-rated Baleba's current Brighton deal runs until 2028 and has the option of a one-year extension. He is currently impressing for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.",
      "United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that the Reds' big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet. Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Baleba are targets, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen told his old club recently to make Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton their top target next summer. “I’m a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer,\" the Dutchman said via BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don’t think the move will be possible until next summer. He’s got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "“He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He’s great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "“His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It’s an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.”",
      "Meanwhile, Reds boss Amorim suggested on Friday afternoon that there will not be any major reinforcements this month. He said: “The transfer window is not going to change.",

      "Ruben Amorim will have some big decisions to make for his Manchester United starting lineup when they travel to Elland Road on Sunday. The Red Devils will be hoping to bounce back after dropping points against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves.",
      "Portuguese coach Amorim will have limited options to choose from for the trip to Yorkshire, however. United will take a depleted squad after Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries for the busiest period of the season.",
      "To compound matters, Amorim can still not choose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Noussair Mazraoui after they progressed to the last-16 at AFCON with Cameroon, Morocco and Ivory Coast. United's boss relented in his tactical rigidity to change formation for a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "A 1-1 draw against Wolves quickly dispelled any hint that Amorim would stick with a back four permanently. The 40-year-old may have it on his mind to swap back to the system when playing old rivals Leeds, however.",
      "United's boss has admitted he is short of options. \"You can see the squad, it is impossible and we cannot stretch the players that we don't have at the moment,\" he said.",
      "\"I will try to put together a team that is ready to cope with that. I will try to read the game and try to understand what I should do to help them.\"",
      "Senne Lammens is an obvious choice in goal after starting 13 games on the bounce since making his debut in October. Those ahead of him are less certain.",
      "But Amorim could be wise to switch to what worked so well against Newcastle and to utilise a back four. That could see Diogo Dalot, the increasingly impressive Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw line up.",
      "With more bodies in advanced positions, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte should form the base of midfield, with few alternative options outside of academy products. Jack Fletcher was chosen from the bench last time out.",
      "Ahead of them, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha can attack from the flanks. The former has transformed into a goal threat since being moved further up the field.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, widely linked to a move before January arrived, should offer some support to lead man Benjamin Sesko. The Dutch star will hope to get on the scoresheet once again.",

      "Manchester United could be in for a significant financial boost due to a clever clause included in Scott McTominay's transfer to Napoli. The Scottish midfielder bid farewell to his childhood club in the summer of 2024, joining the Italian heavyweights in a €30.5m (£25.7m) deal that brought his two-decade-long relationship with United to an end.",
      "The decision to sell McTominay raised eyebrows among fans given United's proud tradition of promoting academy graduates – but the move could prove profitable thanks to a sell-on clause included in the agreement.",
      "As part of the terms, 10 per cent of any future sale from Napoli will go directly back to United. This could result in a substantial payout as the 29-year-old continues to carve out a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, showcasing impressive form for both club and country.",
      "Last year, McTominay was crowned player of the season in Italy following a stellar debut campaign where he played a pivotal role in helping Antonio Conte's team secure the Serie A title. In total, Napoli's No.8 netted 13 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions, earning him a nomination for the esteemed Ballon d'Or award won by Ousmane Dembele.",
      "McTominay has also showcased his skills on the international stage with Scotland, a country he qualifies to represent through his father. In November, he scored a sensational overhead kick as Scotland triumphed over Denmark 4-2, securing the Tartan Army's place in the World Cup for the first time since 1998.",
      "Transfermarkt now values McTominay at approximately €45m (£40m), with two-and-a-half years left on his contract with Napoli. The Italian club currently ranks third in Serie A, trailing leaders Inter by just two points.",
      "A sale at that price would earn United an extra £4m due to their sell-on clause. However, this figure could potentially rise even further, with Napoli reportedly open to offers around £60m.",
      "There are even whispers of a shock return to Old Trafford. CaughtOffside reports that United are considering re-signing McTominay as manager Ruben Amorim seeks to strengthen his thin midfield options.",
      "The long-term futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are uncertain, while injuries to Mainoo and captain Fernandes have left United lacking in midfield.",
      "This shortage has forced Amorim to field 18 year old academy player Jack Fletcher for 45 minutes against Newcastle United on Boxing Day, and even deploy centre-back Lisandro Martinez in midfield during a match against Aston Villa. Other rumoured targets include Crystal Palace's standout player Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and former United player James Garner, who is currently with Everton.",

      "Dorgu shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Dalot had a chance thanks to the ball dropping to his feet from a corner but fired over.",
      "That was slick from Casemiro again. There have been some promising moments when United have threatened to build an attack, but it hasn't clicked together yet.",
      "Amorim frustrated at Sesko’s failure to make the ball stick just then. It’s a very bitty game at the moment, no real quality in it, but United certainly shading it. Ugarte had a good start, should be the type of game that suits and he has stood up to the task in that midfield. United producing the crisper passing moves when they get hold of the ball.",
      "Amorim waving his hands in frustration on the touchline as Sesko loses the header and Dorgu fails to win the second ball. The United boss wanted more from the pair.",
      "The kind of start United would have taken before kick-off. One half chance for Leeds but quiet aside from that. Cunha seeing a lot of the ball and United matched the intensity of their hosts. Not quietened it down entirely just yet, but it’s been encouraging.",
      "United will be pleased with their opening 15 minutes. Elland Road was rocking at kick-off, but the noise has dropped due to the game management. They need to keep the ball to quieten the crowd further.",
      "Calvert-Lewin had the pace to beat Martinez just there but Lammens swept up.",
      "Good link up play between Casemiro and Cunha. The latter stuck the ball into the back of the net with a volley, but the move was flagged offside. United should be encouraged by that move because it was slick.",
      "Leeds are pressing aggressively and have started quickly. There is vitriol coming from the stands. Leeds fans were just chanting \"break his legs\" when Cunha picked up the ball down the right.",
      "Martinez winning the toss and turning the teams around, so Leeds attack their Kop in the first half rather than the second half. Chants of “scum” as Senne Lammens makes his way to the other goal. Confirmation of United’s shape as well, which is as expected with Dalot and Shaw at wing-backs and Dorgu as a 10.",
      "\"Scum, scum, scum,\" and \"get into them, f*** them up,\" coming from the Leeds fans sitting around the press box.",
      "We're under way at Elland Road, so follow below for live match updates.",
      "The teams are out and it's a cracking atmosphere, as expected.",
      "Not saying Leeds really can’t stomach United, but the PA just referred to them as the “red side” before reading out the team news. The home ends then booed mercilessly throughout the list of names representing United.",
      "Just 10 minutes away from kick-off.",
      "United warmed up in a back three against Newcastle and then played a back four. They do like that five-v-five warm-up regardless, but it certainly suggests Dorgu is playing in an attacking role, probably as a 10. Shaw left wing-back is also interesting, he hasn’t played that role in a long time, maybe since the 2021 European Championship, so it will be a test of his fitness.",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been dropped to face Leeds due to tactical reasons. Amorim has made one change from the draw with Wolves, bringing Leny Yoro into the side at the expense of Zirkzee.",
      "It appears that Patrick Dorgu will start in the right sided No.10 role. Dorgu played in an advanced role against Newcastle on Boxing Day and scored a volley from the edge of the box to seal a 1-0 victory.",
      "Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are absent from the squad again, while Bruno Fernandes is also unavailable after picking up a muscle injury against Aston Villa before Christmas.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "That appears to confirm Dorgu will be starting in the No.10 role.",
      "The atmosphere is expected to be electric today. Leeds are unbeaten in six matches and will fancy their chances of claiming a scalp at Elland Road, which means the roof could be taken off if they take the lead. United will be in trouble if they allow that to happen - they must silence the crowd.",
      "Who knows what system that team is going to be. A back six maybe? If I had to guess, would be a back three with Shaw left wing-back and Dorgu as one of the 10s. A very odd set-up, whichever way you look at it. Never expected him to play Zirkzee in a game as physical as this, he just doesn’t compete in the duels and he would get bullied today. Chido’s promotion to the first-team squad has been brief. Kukonki replaces him on the bench, two centre-backs among the subs as well as four in the starting XI.",
      "It looks like Dorgu will play in the right side No.10 role this afternoon. Yoro has come into the side for Zirkzee, which is the only change from the draw against Wolves before the New Year. Dorgu was everywhere against Newcastle on Boxing Day, but it will be interesting to see if he can back up that performance. It's also an incredibly youthful bench, with six of the nine players coming from the academy.",
      "XI | Lammens, Yoro, Heaven, Martinez (c), Shaw, Dalot, Dorgu, Casemiro, Ugarte, Sesko, Cunha.",
      "Subs | Bayindir, Fredricson, Kukonki, Malacia, Mantato. J. Fletcher. T. Fletcher, Lacey, Zirkzee.",
      "Just a few minutes away from team news.",
      "United are unbeaten in their last 25 games against promoted sides. By Wednesday night, they could stretch that run to 27, but it’s not going to be easy. It’s surprising United haven’t lost to a newly promoted sid,e given everything else that has gone wrong in recent years, but they have also found a way and their name and status still mean something, especially for teams who are only occasional visitors in this league. Leeds away and Burnley away are games against teams sitting 16th and 19th so should be simple enough for United, but then we know that isn’t going to be the case."

      "Leeds secured a point in a 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield on Thursday night, meaning United have benefited from an extra two days to prepare for the clash in West Yorkshire.",

      "Ruben Amorim has blamed Manchester United's lack of creativity over Christmas on the absence of Bruno Fernandes, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo and said \"any team in the world\" would miss players of that quality. United have been without Amad and Mbeumo for the games against Aston Villa, Newcastle and Wolves after their Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, while Fernandes limped off at half-time at Villa Park and has missed the following two fixtures.",
      "Amorim's side have taken four points from those three games, but had to cling on to the Boxing Day win against Newcastle with a defensive rearguard in the second half. United have managed an expected goals (xG) tally of just 3.6 from those games and only 0.8 of that came against Wolves on Tuesday.",
      "That dire draw against a team yet to win in the Premier League this season could prove costly in the race for Champions League football and Amorim will again be without his star trio at Leeds today as he bemoaned the misfortune of having them all unavailable at the same time.",
      "\"I don't like to talk about that, it sounds like an excuse,\" he said. \"It was bad luck to lose Amad, Bryan, especially and Bruno at the same time. They had more creation in the opportunities than the rest of the team. If you lose the three of them at the same time, any team in the world will struggle.",
      "\"You have all the data and you can sense that three guys create most of the chances for us. And if you lose not one but all three at the same time, of course we are going to struggle. Then you have to put set pieces in that. Who is kicking the set pieces? Amad, Bryan and Bruno. So everything is combined and we just need to acknowledge that.",
      "\"And then it's getting closer to having all these three players. The important thing is to understand why we struggled in the last three games in creation and quality in the game. I think it's clear.\"",
      "Amorim's in-game changes have again come under the microscope since the draw with Wolves. With the Stretford End calling for United to attack, Amorim replaced Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro with 15 minutes to go. It was another risk-averse substitution but United do have a good record for scoring late goals this season and only Arsenal and Manchester City have more than their 33 goals in 19 league games.",
      "\"The first thing you spoke about is that we are creating and scoring more than most of the teams. That is a point,\" said Amorim. \"Then I understand the team better than anyone. And sometimes you have the supporters on your decisions. Sometimes you have to do what you think. And sometimes it's hard for them to understand.",
      "\"But I know when I look at the pitch, I can understand which player is tired, which player is going to be is going to struggle a lot if there is a one against one all the time. And I just try to protect the team and just try to win games. And sometimes it's the best substitution.",
      "\"Sometimes it's the wrong substitution. But I just try to do my best. But you said that. I think there is one team that score more goals than us.",
      "\"We create a lot. We have more shots than anyone. So if we have something here completely different from last year is the way we attack. I think we need to improve the way we defend.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim refused to explain why he had come to the conclusion that he wasn't going to get the money or the time to implement his 3-4-3 system at Manchester United after revealing he didn't expect to add any new players to his squad this month.",
      "Amorim said on Christmas Eve that he was \"starting to understand\" he wouldn't get the finance needed or the time required to make his system \"perfect\" at Old Trafford, but when asked about those comments ahead of United's trip to Elland Road to kick off 2026, he declined to answer.",
      "The 40-year-old cut a despondent figure throughout his pre-match press conference ahead of facing Leeds and had earlier said there were \"no conversations\" about signing players in January, despite saying two weeks ago he was hopeful of doing business this month.",
      "Amorim has since said he would \"have to adapt\" to be successful at Old Trafford, having realised he wasn't going to get the tools to make the system he has persisted with since getting the job in November 2024 work.",
      "Asked to clarify exactly what he meant by those comments, Amorim said: \"I don't want to talk about that. I just focus on the Leeds game.\"",
      "When it was put to Amorim that he might regret saying it, he said: \"No, no, no. But I don’t want to talk about it.\" Amorim was then asked what had made him say he wouldn't get the money to transform the squad in his image a year into the job and whether he had been told by director of football Jason Wilcox that something had changed.",
      "Again, he said, \"I don't want to talk about that\", before telling the reporter, \"You're very smart\", and ending the discussion. The exchange captured Amorim's mood throughout a tetchy press conference.",
      "His comments on the lack of talks about new signings contradicted what he had said last month about focusing on long-term targets and hoping to do some business this month. He also spoke last week about United's joined-up transfer strategy and how he and Wilcox tried to reach decisions together.",
      "\"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason and the board has another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" he said.",
      "\"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything. But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player would not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "United had shown an interest in Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo before the 25-year-old attacker opted to join Manchester City. Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee have since been linked with moves away from Old Trafford this month, but Amorim said his squad wasn't able to cope with departures and told anyone who wanted to leave they had to talk to Wilcox.",
      "\"If you look at our squad, I think it's impossible for someone to leave. But that is... They need to talk with Jason,\" he said.",

      "Manchester United are preparing to face Leeds at Elland Road today. While the table looks healthier for United this season compared to last, the jury is still out on just how much progress has been made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds have struggled for consistency this campaign and the growing list of absentees is not helping matters. In his pre-match press conference, Amorim confirmed he was not expecting any of his injured players to return to the matchday squad today.",
      "That means Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will all miss out due to injury. Meanwhile, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are unavailable as they continue to compete at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "We asked our United writers to pick their team to face Leeds. Here are their line-ups:",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "It doesn't sound like Amorim is expecting anyone back for this game so his options are limited but I would certainly be changing the formation back to 4-3-3. That means Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw as full-backs and Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez in the centre of defence.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee struggled again in the Wolves game and his lack of physicality and competitiveness in the duels is an ongoing issue. So while Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are locks in midfield, I'd take the risk and throw in Jack Fletcher after two 45-minute substitute appearances. He has the energy to match Leeds.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can go back to the right where he thrived on Boxing Day, while Matheus Cunha can drift in from the left. Benjamin Sesko has had a good couple of games without scoring but a goal here would be massive.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "The three at the back system does not work so it makes sense, with the players available, to revert to a back four. Dalot benefits from playing as a full-back and the Reds' December player of the month Heaven is more than worthy of keeping his spot.",
      "Dorgu excelled on the right-wing against Newcastle and his short-term future is certainly in the attacking third. While I would not pick Ugarte ordinarily, he is the obvious choice alongside Casemiro due to the absentees.",
      "I would keep faith with Zirkzee and play him in a No.10 role - it is not ideal but the Dutchman looks better there than he does leading the line. This would mean the Reds switch to a 4-2-3-1 which could put Leeds on the back foot.",

The error message read: \"We apologise for the loss of sound and hope to correct the fault shortly.\"",

      "As a result, Liverpool and Chelsea moved above them with their North West rivals opening up a three-point lead in the final Champions League place. A point at Elland Road would be enough for United to leapfrog the Londoners on Sunday and into fifth.",

The back four system that worked so well against Newcastle could return, meaning Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw would line up in the full-back roles with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez at centre-back.",

Joshua Zirkzee was brought off at half time in the draw with Wolves, a decision Amorim confirmed was made for tactical reasons. The Dutchman can start again behind the striker in the absence of Mount and Mbeumo.",

      "The 18-year-old landed himself the record-breaking £1million prize-money as his astronomic rise to darts stardom continues. Littler, a lifelong United supporter, predicted that Ruben Amorim's side would beat Leeds United on Sunday.",
      "However, he immediately shot down a reporter's quip that if Littler took the Sid Waddell trophy to Old Trafford, after parading it around the Theatre of Dreams last January, it would be the only piece of silverware that they'd see this season.",
      "He said: \"If they invite me then I'm sure I can go along again. I wouldn't want to be my friend here tonight, he's going to Leeds tomorrow, six o'clock train, so good luck to him, but we'll win tomorrow.\"",

      "But The Nuke was having none of it and hit back: \"Thank you mate, thank you - don't need to hear the rest.\"",
      "Littler could show off the prestigious darts trophy at one of United's forthcoming home matches but he will have to wait until January 11 for their FA Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion or even the Manchester derby on January 17. However, it would be a tight turnaround for the visit of Pep Guardiola's side to Old Trafford with Littler set to participate in the Bahrain Darts Masters.",
      "The 18-year-old paraded the trophy last year after he, then 17, beat Luke Humphries in the final at Alexandra Palace.",
      "He avenged his defeat to the 30-year-old a year earlier after he burst into the spotlight as a 16-year-old sensation.",

He featured in five Premier League matches last season, whilst also appearing twice in the Europa League, but was permitted to join Wednesday on loan to gain regular first-team experience this time out.",

Nevertheless, he subsequently removed the post after it was explained that the 'struggling' reference pertained to the Owls' poor league standing.",

Sometimes you play for Manchester United and you go see different realities and you understand that football can be so different and that you are really lucky to be in Manchester United.\"",

      "Welcome along to our latest Manchester United question and answer session with senior club writer Tyrone Marshall, who covers the daily goings-on at Old Trafford.",
      "The January transfer window is now open and United could be active this month. Joshua Zirkzee is wanted by Roma and Kobbie Mainoo could push for a loan move, which would lead to replacements coming in.",
      "On the pitch, Ruben Amorim is in need of a New Year pick-me-up after ending 2025 with a dismal draw at home to Wolves.",
      "We asked for questions and you delivered. The responses to those submitted are below. We will be running weekly question and answer sessions from now, so keep an eye on our social media feeds and get your questions in as we seek to keep you plugged in to everything going on at Old Trafford.",
      "Will the club make any short-term loans to plug gaps? Like a Conor Gallagher or Ivan Toney?",
      "It's a possibility. United insist the focus is on long-term targets and anything they do will be to bring forward a move they had planned to make further down the line.",
      "I don't think Toney fits that bill, although I do think he would have been a good signing had United made their move when he left Brentford, rather than now. There is faith in Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford and any attacking signing is likely to replace Zirkzee as more of a back-up, and Toney isn't going to play that role.",
      "Midfield is an area United will monitor this month. They expect to start an overhaul of the midfield in the summer but could bring that forward if possible. It might well depend on whether anyone leaves. Manuel Ugarte's future is uncertain and Mainoo could yet look to push for a loan this month if his situation doesn't improve.",
      "Do they have the PSR room to make a big move for a Adam Wharton or another young CM, maybe from abroad like Sangare from Lens?",
      "United's PSR position has improved, as witnessed by their summer spending and the willingness to be in the running for £65million Antoine Semenyo this month. The PSR rules are also on their way, to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) next season. Those rules should, in theory, better suit United.",
      "I don't think there is any chance Palace let Wharton go this month. Look at the fuss Oliver Glasner kicked up when they almost sold Marc Guehi in the summer, it isn't going to happen, especially when they are in the running for European football again.",
      "Someone like Sangare would probably be more achievable, although there is nothing concrete there at the moment. Again, something like that may depend on the futures of Ugarte and Mainoo this month.",
      "Get Kobbie fit and playing. How come a first-choice England international of last year can't get a place in our current \"star-studded\" team, who are playing such sensational football and sweeping aside teams week in week out?",
      "It's been a difficult 12 months for Mainoo. It seems pretty clear that Amorim isn't convinced, although he isn't the only one. Mainoo is an exceptional midfielder in possession but his out-of-possession work needs a lot of improvement. That is why there is a reluctance to play him too deep and why Amorim trialled him as a No.10 and even a striker last year.",
      "His quick feet and dribbling make him a real threat in those areas. If he can sharpen up with his positioning in deeper areas he can develop into a quality midfielder, but to do that he needs to play games.",
      "It's a shame he has picked up an injury when he would have had starts and it will be fascinating to see when he is fit again if he can get into the side and if Amorim does give him more game time when he uses a back four and plays three in midfield.",
      "We should definitely give Martinez a good run at No.6 in midfield. He’s a great defender and great at forward passing. He’s a natural for midfield and could save us a lot of money.",
      "Amorim said back in November that he didn't see Martinez as a long-term option in midfield and we've only seen him there for 45 minutes since, when he came on at half-time against Aston Villa.",
      "He has played there for Ajax and has the passing range to do so, but you have to offset that with what you would lose if you took him out of the centre of defence. He can break lines with his passing from deep and is an excellent defender, arguably United's best one-on-one.",
      "I don't see him getting much of a chance in midfield. I think the long-term solution to United's issues at No.6 are going to lie in the transfer market.",

      "January is arguably one of the toughest months for Premier League managers. Not only have we reached the halfway stage of the season and fixture congestion begins to ramp up with the FA Cup returning for the top flight, teams also have to negotiate a transfer window.",
      "For Manchester United, the January transfer window very rarely offers much optimism for supporters. In their recent history, the Reds have chosen not to make big transfer statements midway through the season, even when new additions were desperately needed.",
      "When everyone knew United needed to add a centre-forward to their attack under Erik ten Hag, the Reds were left to settle with the arrival of Wout Weghorst in the January transfer window. While the Dutchman had performed well for his national team, the Premier League was clearly too big a step for the target man.",
      "Of course, clubs like United have to be wary of overspending in the mid-season window. It appears Ruben Amorim will watch the 2026 window go by without making any alterations to his team.",
      "He explained in his pre-Leeds press conference: \"We have no conversations in this moment about having any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea that is going to continue.\" This prediction is bad news for United.",
      "It is clear to United fans that at least one change should be made this month. In terms of outgoings, Joshua Zirkzee is obviously not a player who Amorim has much faith in.",
      "His substitution against Wolves at half time, despite scoring, was a clear sign the forward has no future at the club. Sadly for Zirkzee, he is not good enough to lead the line for United and, playing deeper in the No.10 role, he is not better than Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Mason Mount.",
      "The right thing to do in the January transfer window is to let Zirkzee leave, especially with Roma keen. If that deal was done, there would have been space available to add a striker to the squad who could compete with Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, the claim of no changes being made to the squad in the January transfer window suggests this plan is not under consideration. This is a blow for the Reds as they look to gain some consistency while pushing for a place in the top four.",
      "Fortunately for United, there was some positive news to close out the press conference. Amorim was asked whether he expected any of his players to come to him and request their exit from Old Trafford this month. \"No,\" Amorim replied. \"I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything.\"",
      "If this proves to be the case, it would be great news for the Reds. One of the main fears in the January transfer window is that Kobbie Mainoo will push hard for an exit in an attempt to play regularly before the World Cup.",
      "Mainoo leaving in January would be a disaster for the Reds. Not only would United be losing one of their best academy graduates in recent years, they would also be left painfully short in the midfield. Even if Mainoo only left on loan, a temporary exit would still see him take a step closer to a possible permanent exit.",
      "Injuries to Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes have proven the Reds are lacking playmakers in this squad. The Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro combination does not offer much in the way of creativity, that much is clear.",
      "United cannot afford for Mainoo to leave. If he is looking to stay in Manchester and fight for his place, that can only be good news for the club.",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "While RB Leipzig will be keen to keep hold of their young talent, it's been hinted that a big offer could tempt the German club into cashing-in on his signature.",

      "\"However, it will remain the case in the future that we will occasionally have to let our players go. We still need to generate transfer fees and have players in our squad who are attractive to absolute top clubs.",
      "\"Generally speaking, you should never rule anything out in football. If there's an exorbitant offer far above market value, and we are convinced that it's a unique opportunity for a significant profit, then we have to be honest with ourselves, discuss it, and keep a cool head.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is currently on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty with the Ivory Coast. So far this season, he has scored six times and provided a further three assists in 14 Bundesliga games.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

Joshua Zirkzee scored thanks to a heavily deflected strike in the 27th minute, however, Wolves drew level on the stroke of half-time following a headed goal from defender Ladislav Krejci.",

      "Manchester United drew 1-1 with Wolves on Tuesday evening as they brought a miserable calendar year to an end in fitting fashion.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee put United ahead with a deflected effort before Ladislav Krejci equalised on the stroke of half time.",
      "Unlike in the meeting between the two sides earlier this season, there was no second-half change of gear from United and the visitors were arguably the better team in the second half. Patrick Dorgu scored late on but it was ruled out for offside.",
      "Check out the highlights and reaction from Old Trafford below.",
      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim.",
      "Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: Couple of excellent saves in either half, the second of which from Krejci was a strong hand and he reacted well to claw the ball from danger. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing radar not as good as it usually is and didn't carry the same authority as he did on Boxing Day. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: His challenge on Hwang Hee-chan led to the first goal and he was solid in the middle of the defence. Boos when replaced by Yoro showed fans are falling for him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Lots of ground to cover in the second half and tested at times, but showed his fitness is improving. Combination with Patrick Dorgu seems to be lacking something. 6",
      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "The points are shared.",
      "Dorgu has the ball in the net but it's flagged offside.",
      "Lacey is warming up and Amorim could roll the dice with another youngster here.",
      "This would be an awful result against the Premier League's worst team.",
      "Yoro and Mantato ON.",
      "Heaven and Ugarte OFF.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" chant the Stretford End.",
      "United struggling to create against this shocking Wolves side.",
      "Lammens makes a huge save and Rob Edwards cannot believe that has not gone in.",
      "Malacia, Yoro, Fredricson and Lacey have been sent to warm up.",
      "It seems Wolves goalkeeper Sa is already time wasting just minutes into the second half.",
      "Wolves fans chanted \"we've scored a goal, we've scored a goal\" before the interval.",
      "Here we go for the second half of the game.",
      "And here are your half-time ratings...",
      "Lammens",
      "Good save from Bueno 7",
      "Martinez",
      "Not at his best on the ball 6",
      "Heaven",
      "Tone-setting tackle for goal 7",
      "Shaw",

      "Sloppy 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Struggling for control 5",
      "Dorgu",
      "Moved around and not involved 6",
      "Zirkzee",
      "Got the goal but too passive 6",
      "Cunha",
      "Little impact 6",
      "Sesko",
      "Bright 7",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Wolves are level through Krejci, who finds the net with a header from a corner.",
      "Wolves have enjoyed some pressure as the game approaches half-time.",
      "Sesko hits the post from a header at a corner.",
      "Dalot puts his arm around him as if to say 'keep going, your goal will come'",
      "Dorgu tries his luck from distance and comes close to scoring - it goes out for a corner.",
      "Wolves are in this game - that's another decent chance for Hee-chan at the Stretford End.",
      "A year to the day since Zirkzee was booed off against Newcastle. Not exactly a classic goal though and the kind of strike this game deserved. Heaven deserves all the credit for it, a tone-setting challenge to win the ball back and his run was the first bit of positive play in a while. United have been poor and way too cautious against the worst team in the league. They need to be braver than this.",
      "Zirkzee fires United into the lead thanks to a deflection.",
      "Superb work from Heaven, who won the ball and created the chance.",
      "We're almost 25 minutes into this game and it's been a really poor start from United against a team who are currently on course to be remembered as the worst ever in Premier League history.",
      "Hee-chan has a decent chance from the edge of the box but he fires it well over.",
      "That is excellent from Sesko, good run into the channel and with nothing on he creates the chance all by himself, shot deflected just wide. The kind of play we didn’t see from Hojlund last year, creating a chance out of nothing. Maybe that will get United going, because it’s been really flat so far. Amorim not happy at all on the touchline.",
      "Sesko creates a chance for himself after shrugging off his marker and forcing an opening.",
      "Amorim is becoming increasingly frustrated with United's lack of movement off the ball.",
      "Amorim has been waving his arms because he wants the ball played out quicker from the back. Wolves have just two points in the Premier League but they look well-organised tonight.",
      "Cunha just won a free-kick close to the box and the decision was... dubious from the referee.",
      "The back four has been and gone. The shiny new toy on Boxing Day but forgotten about before New Year’s Eve. Something of a surprise to see Amorim switch back to this system at home to Wolves, but the proof will be in the pudding. Dorgu excellent on the right wing and one of the benefits of that system was the number of players in support of the attackers. Not always had that in a back three. United should be dominating this game in terms of territory so chances to get players forward."

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“Similar to Smit, it’s going to take a big amount of money. I don’t think €60m or €70m is going to be enough to convince Leipzig. The pricing is going to be higher. But for sure, Diomande and Smit, two names that are already now driving clubs crazy for the summer transfer window.”",

      "His strike-rate of seven goals in seven games is superb and he has to be followed when in this sort of form.",
      "Will it be enough to give Leeds all three points?",
      "Perhaps not. Before the trip to Liverpool, three times in the previous four matches DCL’s goals were only enough to secure a draw rather than a win.",

But again none of this is insanely complicated. So what’s the difference between coaching standards and why did Ferguson get more out of players than Roy Evans, as a distant example? Or is it just about the best players and avoiding too many injuries? Rafa did this clever thing a few times where he set the team up to look like they were playing one formation and then once the game started they’d rapidly switch to something else. A few times in the champions league we scored a couple of early goals and then switched to shut out mode for 150 minutes. So is that just a little bait and switch tactic; you make the other team think you’re playing 4-5-1 but suddenly play 3-5-2 and flood extra players into spaces they’re not expecting.

Also Ajax do this from at all levels called the 1000 touch work out to make sure their players are all comfortable with the ball at their feet. Maybe on this latter point the really art of coaching is devising training routines that help players deal with real game situations?

Maybe Solanke won’t be injured forever. And maybe Kudus will carry on being the player who’s got 1 goal and 1 assist in his last 11 games. And maybe Solanke x Johnson could have been a thing again later in January when Kudus is even more knackered and looking a lot like second season at West Ham Kudus.

      "Becoming only the third Premier League team to come away from a game with Wolves carrying anything less than three points in their back pocket would be mortifying enough if it hadn’t come on the back of a win over Newcastle that had some giddy sorts even talking up unlikely title tilts.",

      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until after the summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",

      "According to reports, Antoine Semenyo had an ‘agreement’ with Manchester United, but he decided to pull the plug on a move over a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, grabbing nine goals and three assists in his 18 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "The talented winger has been a key player for Bournemouth for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to another level this term and has earned admiring glances from other clubs.",
      "In recent weeks, it has emerged that every Big Six club have expressed their interest in signing Semenyo, with this competition and his £65m release clause making a January transfer inevitable.",
      "Man City and Man Utd were said to be the leading contenders for his signature, but it has emerged that he has opted for a move to the Eithad and a deal is likely to be completed in the next few days.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "On Thursday evening, a report claimed there had been a ‘breakthrough in negotiations’ between Man City and Bournemouth, who have now reached an ‘agreement’ over Semenyo.",
      "This is a blow for Man Utd, who need to sign another quality option or two in attacking areas to provide extra competition.",
      "United are currently overly reliant on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who signed instead of Semenyo in the summer.",
      "A report from journalist Duncan Castles claims Man Utd actually had an ‘agreement’ with Semenyo over persoanl terms, but this deal fell through as the winger ‘took exception to’ a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "“As we discussed in the podcast in September, Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in person to assess his character,” Castles said on the Transfers Podcast.",
      "“United had agreed personal terms with the player only for Semenyo to discover that their salary offer to him was significantly less than what they’d given Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“This allowed Bournemouth to persuade the player to sign a new contract with a release clause.”",
      "Castles has also revealed when Semenyo is likely to complete his move from Bournemouth to Man City.",
      "“I understand that Bournemouth expect to keep the player for the next two games,” Castles added.",
      "“The clause is valid for the first 10 days of January only, and they’re running it to the end of the clause before allowing him to go to another club.”",
      "He continued: “Pretty much all the top clubs in the Premier League have tried to exploit [Semenyo’s release clause].",
      "“Manchester United came back in. Chelsea enquired. Liverpool looked at time. Tottenham made an offer and failed again because he decided Manchester City was the most attractive club to move to.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo’s move to Manchester City is reportedly ‘agreed’, while Pep Guardiola’s side are also ‘in talks’ to sign Liverpool target Marc Guehi.",
      "According to reports, ‘three major reasons’ have prevented Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo from joining Liverpool in next month’s transfer window.",
      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "Man City are ‘closing in on a full agreement’ for Antoine Semenyo with Liverpool not expected to make a late move for the Bournemouth forward.",
      "Former Liverpool man Jermaine Pennant thinks it’s “really stupid” that the Reds haven’t put themselves in the position to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports."

      "There is some significant jostling for position going on now, with Chelsea throwing a spanner in the works by axeing Enzo Maresca, who had been a relative outsider to be the next out despite his increasingly perplexing post-match musings.",
      "There is now a new frontrunner. Well, we say new – both he and his current club have already been at the head of this market in different lives this season.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, Tottenham’s baffling home-away dichotomy and winless runs at Burnley and Bournemouth are all causing significant ripples.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they end 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they have somehow just about stayed in range of Arsenal at the summit.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should arbitrary position has been handed to them this week. But you still don’t want to find yourself right at the bottom of that group, do you? Having to accept that technically so far this season you’ve actually been worse than Spurs?",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. Their only wins in the last six games, all of which were winnable, have come against Burnley. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "We didn’t have to wait long for the first Big Six manager departure of 2026, and there are significant whispers that we could be in something of a London bus situation.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",

      "The Red Devils are being heavily linked with several potential targets as they are crying out for upgrades in certain positions.",
      "This is despite the Premier League side having a positive summer transfer window, during which they offloaded most of their dead wood and spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",

      "City’s title-sniffing winning run is over after being held to a goalless draw at Sunderland. But all the great and good get held to a draw at Sunderland these days.",
      "There was little sense of wheels falling off, but it does leave City precious little wriggle room here. They can’t now really afford to be handing more ground to the galloping Gunners and must cash in on any confusion or lack of focus under, as far as know at this point, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane.",

      "But Amorim has now perfected the art. Instead of a buoyant United side with a couple of festive wins under their belts, this is now once again a reduced and uncertain Man United. And they must now head across the Pennines to face a Leeds side who actually have turned a corner in recent weeks and struck upon something that works in a six-game unbeaten runs featuring a win over Chelsea and now a pair of draws against Liverpool.",

      "There’s better news ahead, because after that it’s Dr Tottenham and they are 100 per cent the very team you’d choose to try and bring an 11-game winless run to an end.",
      "But it does seem likely to get worse before it gets better for Iraola. And he’s also just clearly got this whole thing backwards too.",
      "Had Bournemouth started badly and then hit their stride he would be a solid favourite for all three of the either definitely or feasibly available Big Six jobs at this time. The bad run at the start of the season would have been attributed entirely to losing his entire defence in the summer and explained away far more easily than it is now this run of despair has come after he’s already proved he didn’t actually need all those brilliant defenders at all actually.",
      "With Antoine Semenyo’s departure also now imminent, it’s an odd old time for a manager who should be looking at the next step up the career ladder having done all kinds of brilliant things in his current job, but who might instead soon find himself coming under actual pressure in his current role having watched Bournemouth slip right down into and now out the back of the great fog of mediocrity that is this season’s Premier League mid-table peloton.",

      "The result is fine. The manner of it not so much. Most Spurs fans would have settled for a point last night; but they will not settle for playing only for that point and showing neither the Dare nor the Do to strive for anything more.",
      "That is what Thomas Frank still doesn’t grasp, and why last night’s draw might actually be his most damaging result yet. Because it highlights the gulf that exists between him and fans who spent the entire game singing for lost heroes from Dele to Christian Eriksen and Mousa Dembele. Even Eric Dier’s song got an airing as, of course, did Brennan Johnson’s. Along with more than one refrain of Boring, Boring Tottenham.",
      "The fans were clear and unanimous in their displeasure – and this is the away fans Thomas Frank has previously praised in contrast to those mean home ones who make it impossible for his players to beat even Wolves at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "But in Frank’s mind, the trip to Brentford represented a job well done.",
      "It also represented the first time since the disastrous trip to Arsenal in November that he had paired Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha in midfield, adding a layer of nonsense atop that cement-mixer of a midfield by asking a third defensive midfielder in Archie Gray to play as a kind of false 10.",
      "All three are good players. All three are perfectly valid and useful members of Spurs’ squad. They absolutely do not and cannot together constitute a viable midfield three.",
      "We’ve said before and we’ll say again that Palhinha and Bentancur specifically are an either/or proposition.",

      "",
      "Coventry’s serene march to the Premier League has encountered a minor bump in the road after a run of two wins, three draws and two defeats in the last seven games, but the good news for Frank Lampard and the lads is that nobody else is making a compelling case of stepping up to put any pressure on the leaders.",
      "One team with lofty ambitions to do so would be Birmingham, but after a run of four wins in six games up to the start of last month it’s now seven games without a win after a painful 3-0 defeat at Watford on New Year’s Day.",

      "La Liga is back, back, back after its Christmas break, with a local derby in Barcelona the headline act.",

We had never finished below 8th. We always challenged for the cups at least if nothing. We made a half hearted attempt at top 4. We didn’t lose to some of the worst teams to grace the Premier League. There is a period between 2013 & till Ten Hag left, and then there is this.",
      "If Amorim won his next 14 games IN A ROW, he will still be 1 win off matching David Moyes’ record at MUFC. That is an abolsutely shocking stastic. His formation is rubbish, his man management is rubbish. He is using Manchester United as work experience to learn on the job, and waste our time, effort & money. Losing to Grimsby & [drawing versus] this Wolves team in the same season is a sackable offence 10 out of 10 times. But the board will never learn. They keep hiring “up and comers” in managers, in strikers, in defense, in everything. Hoping to find a gem in a pile of horseshit, but what we are left with is just horseshit.",

But he looks so far out of his depth, that I honestly feel 90% of the mailbox, including raigbater champion Stewie would make a better manager at MUFC. It’s that bad. Chatgpt would make better decisions. The whole job of a manager is to have good tactics & plans, manage the players, have an eye for what will work. He knows none of that. He is an embarrassment to the club and just football in general.",
      "This is a manager who was so scared of what the media will say, he preferred to lose playing 3-5-2 rather than change it to 4 at the back and win. In his own words. He is so clueless from day 1 that he himself feels 75% of his decisions were wrong.",
      "These are signs of a weak, fragile & clueless man. I will always hope the manager succeeds, but I can’t help but be frustrated. We couldnt beat fuckin WOLVES!!! And they honestly had the much better chances and should have won. It’s that bad. And all the Amorim supporters say “give him time”… it’s been 60+ games!! If you wanna back him, fair enough. But let’s not be blinded by saying this is the version of Amorim that will ever succeed.

      "Happy new year! There appears to be a lot of face saving and revisionism from Chelsea fans now, and dare I say it a divide in the fan base, so I want to kind of set the record straight and use only facts to discuss the sacking of Enzo Maresca.",
      "David Ornstein is reporting that back in October, Maresca told the Chelsea board he was already in discussions with Man City about replacing Pep. Then he was doing the same again, a second round of negotiations in December. That is a manager who has had his head turned. Would that be accepted by a fanbase if it was a player? Let’s ask Liverpool FC supporters and Trent Alexander Arnold.",
      "So Maresca isn’t focussed fully on Chelsea at this point. And that appears to have found its way to the dressing room, where he conceivably lost the players confidence and trust. Results have been pretty good since though… no? Oh. No.",
      "Then there is the argument that Maresca wasn’t backed by the Chelsea owners/board. The facts of the matter are he asked for Man City academy products who he knew. He was behind the signings of Palmer (thankfully!), Delap, Tosin and Sancho’s loan. He also asked for Dewsbury Hall, and duly received. On top of this he was handed young players capable of developing into world class talent. Yet he has appeared completely incapable of coaching a defence or improving any individual. His greatest successes in respect of individual players are Robert Sanchez now making fewer mistakes and Reece James being injury free for a year. That’s pretty much it.",
      "There are Chelsea fans saying that Maresca wasn’t given time. He had 18 months. Maresca was the tenth longest serving Premier League manager when the bell chimed on his final minute in charge.",
      "Finally we have the “he had to rotate to keep everyone happy” argument. And Chelsea’s bloated squad is the reason behind the rotation. A reminder then, that in every single competition Chelsea play in, they are bound by the same squad size limits as every other team. They are not trying to give 60 different players minutes in the Premier League. It’s just not a thing. Chelsea have used 25 different players in the Premier League. The same number as Man United, Wolves, Brighton and Sunderland. One player more than Arsenal and Man City. Yet Chelsea have made the most changes to their starting 11.",
      "Maresca’s stubborn refusal to find/use a consistent lineup or even consistent spine ultimately led to Chelsea lacking consistency until his final breath, as it were.",
      "His greatest win is undoubtedly the club World Cup success. A genuine display of tactical awareness caught even me off guard, in a final where we out PSG’d PSG. But an end of season cup competition where Maresca could consistently play his best team, with the fewest changes to each starting line up… well, that’s there for all to see isn’t it. Consistency breeds consistency.",

      "Guess what? My original team is still better. The AI teams look like they are working, mostly make reasonable changes, but sometimes make bonkers ones too.",
      "You also realise just how many variables exist, with what is really a small data set of games and overall information, making it tricky to get it right. I am sure an EPL club can afford better talent and tools, but would still be subject to the same limitations of a small data set. 38 games is just not enough and as teams change dramatically each season (and half season) not sure that past data is as useful. Wondering if Chelsea and Maresca were one of the teams? Might make more sense of some of his seemingly whacky team selections. No?",

It all sounds rather important and impactful but is ultimately another cosmetic PR exercise. No real visibility into the process or at least how any outcome of the panel might impact refereeing process changes.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly ‘determined to revive’ his Manchester United career months after his exit from the club was blocked, and amid a continued lack of minutes.",
      "United have made their preferred midfield pairing clear. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro has played the majority of games there together this season, and Mainoo has been given hardly any minutes.",
      "The Englishman is yet to start a Premier League game this season, having featured 212 minutes in the competition in all this term.",
      "Of Amorim’s 61 games in charge of United, Mainoo has started just 16, suggesting the manager is not the biggest fan of the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo looked to exit in the summer, but his request to leave the club on loan was blocked by United.",
      "Though his minutes have been sparse since it’s said the midfielder does not want to quit the club.",
      "The Sun reports Mainoo is ‘determined to revive’ his career at Old Trafford despite a lack of minutes and an air of ‘friction’ between him and Amorim.",
      "Indeed, the working relationship between the pair was said to have been strained prior to Mainoo’s brother, Jordan, wearing a ‘Free Kobbie’ shirt in the stands during the 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in December.",
      "At the time of that incident, United legend Roy Keane suggested there was a way back for Mainoo, despite his brother’s antics, and it seems he’s in agreement.",
      "Keane said: “Are you telling me that he can’t sit there for another six months? He might think the manager’s on his way out in the summer. He’s 20 years of age, what’s wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he’s not getting a chance, we’ve all had to do it.",
      "“Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie [Carragher] made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United.",
      "“Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] ‘he has to play.’ He’s got to get that in his mindset.",
      "“And when he’s got his idiot of a brother doing all that, we shouldn’t even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you’re just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.”",
      "Manchester United’s midfield will look very different by the start of next season and this is how we think their rebuild will unfold via seven deals…",
      "According to reports, one potential Manchester United signing in January is already ‘off’, while three players ‘could quit’ the Premier League giants.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has commented on Kobbie Mainoo’s future at the Premier League giants as he remains linked with an exit.",
      "Man United head coach Ruben Amorim says Bruno Fernandes is “impossible to replace” but he has to find a way against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Christmas has been ruined for Kobbie Mainoo after the news he may have to stay at Manchester United after all.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo did not even play for Manchester United but that does not matter as a new ‘verdict’ drops just as Morgan Rogers is deified."

      "Man Utd may never beat their worst January signing ever, but it’s Leeds who bought ‘the most expensive player in football history in terms of cost per game’.",
      "Every Premier League club’s greatest January signing is worth a gander too.",
      "",
      "Many see Dennis Bergkamp’s FA Cup semi-final penalty miss as the point Arsenal’s Double became Manchester United’s Treble in 1999, but the sliding doors moment arguably came even later.",
      "The two sides were separated by goal difference heading into the final two games of the Premier League season, and both faced difficult fixtures. United had to travel to Blackburn and host Tottenham, while Arsenal visited Leeds and took on Aston Villa at Highbury.",
      "Arsenal blinked first. They were beaten 1-0 by Leeds 24 hours before United drew 0-0 at Ewood Park, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink netting the goal that effectively crowned United champions.",
      "But the game will always be remembered for the inexplicable profligacy of crossbar challenge champion Kaba Diawara, who was thwarted by woodwork and Nigel Martyn about four times in a 19-minute substitute cameo.",
      "The striker had joined that January for £2.5m, and was billed by Arsene Wenger as the next Nicolas Anelka. Fifteen games, no goals and 123 days after moving to north London, he was loaned back out to France and never played for the Gunners again.",
      "The next Nicolas Anelka he was not.",
      "",
      "“He has played in the Champions League. He’ll be a good asset for the future,” said Gerard Houllier when he paid a not-inconsiderable £6.2m for his old Lyon man Jean Makoun in 2011.",
      "He was not a good asset for the future. A month later he was sent off for a lunge on Blackpool’s DJ Campbell and things never really got any better, with the Cameroonian eventually playing just eight league games for Villa before leaving for Olympiakos on loan and then Rennes on a permanent deal after new Villa manager Paul Lambert said he “had not got a clue what he looks like”.",
      "Even Philippe Coutinho made a bigger impact, largely on the wage bill.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe reacted to his first January transfer window as a Premier League manager with all the restraint of Neil Custis in an argument with Jim White. That Josh King ended their first top-flight season as top scorer with seven goals suggested they needed a striker, but Juan Iturbe, Benik Afobe and Lewis Grabban for a combined £18m is rarely ever the answer to any question other than ‘what would you buy if consequences didn’t exist?’.",
      "Iturbe was a loan, and Afobe was vaguely understandable, the Premier League virgin having impressed with Championship Wolves. But the deal for Grabban was just bizarre. Bournemouth signed the forward for £300,000 in 2012, sold him for £3m in 2014, then watched him score one goal in six top-flight games for Norwich before deciding to part with £8m to bring him back.",
      "He scored one goal in 22 appearances for the Cherries before finally leaving again in 2018.",
      "",
      "Long before the Premier League Bees were signing the likes of Christian Eriksen, they were having bucket collections to fund the wages of veteran striker Shipperley, who turned up at Griffin Park looking like he’d been on the buckets at KFC after his contract at Sheffield United had been cancelled.",
      "In 11 League One games, Shipperley failed to net before taking the hint and retiring.",
      "",
      "Brighton broke their club transfer record in 2018 to sign the Dutchman from PSV for over £14m after a glorious half-season in which he had scored nine goals in 15 Eredivisie games.",
      "“He is a strong, powerful and quick centre-forward with a real eye for goal, and will increase our attacking options in the second half of the season,” said Chris Hughton, who must have felt pretty pleased with himself when Locadia scored on his debut from the bench; it would be the first of only three goals in 34 Premier League appearances.",
      "He had a couple of loans with options to buy – FC Cincinnati and Bochum chose not to – before Locadia was allowed to leave for nothing in winter 2022. He is going to the World Cup with Curacao despite not actually having a club.",
      "",
      "There might be an element of recency bias at play, but also for the cool price of £12m Burnley received precisely two goals in 22 games from Weghorst, who scored more often on loan at both Besiktas and Hoffenheim.",
      "Not at Manchester United, though, with whom Weghorst ultimately made what will surely be the Premier League appearances of his career before being crowned the club’s “worst player” ever.",
      "Burnley received a bit of cash for those loans away, but not nearly enough to mask their embarrassment.",
      "",
      "We’re reserving judgement on Mykhaylo Mudryk for now and though Fernando Torres is another obvious answer, especially since his transfer fee was more than twice that of Cuadrado, his impact was three or four times more telling than the Colombian’s.",
      "Torres can at least claim to have played a huge part in the club’s Champions and Europa League wins; Cuadrado started four Premier League games and assisted one goal in their run to the title after arriving in January 2015. He was loaned out to Juventus that summer, then again in August 2016, and left Stamford Bridge to make his Turin move permanent in May 2017.",
      "But things aren’t looking great for Mudryk.",
      "",
      "It took until the 2013 arrival of Dwight Gayle for Crystal Palace to finally and completely exorcise the lingering ghost of Ismael.",
      "The defender was the club’s record signing for 15 years after joining from Strasbourg for £2.75m in an ill-fated attempt from Steve Coppell to maintain their Premier League status. The Frenchman played 13 games, left for less than £2.75m after nine months and was playing for Bayern Munich within seven years.",
      "His coaching career has gone less well.",
      "",
      "Then-manager Sam Allardyce (still seems odd) described him as “the best in Europe” at the price of £27m in 2018. It never sounded right and 11 goals in 61 games for Everton can be offered as pretty compelling evidence.",
      "It took the Toffees four years to get shot of Tosun, who eventually came off the payroll after four years when he went back for another stint at Besiktas.",
      "",
      "Let Steve Sidwell tell the story:",
      "“In January, relegation battle, we needed a striker. So they went and got Kostas Mitroglou, I think his name was. This f***er, he did not stop eating. Honesty, he did, I’m telling you now, he did not stop eating. He was a big boy. And you know the protein bars, every time you’d see him, he’d be walking around the training ground with a f***ing protein bar.”",
      "What Sidwell did not say: The Greek striker was signed for £12m in January 2014 and he played three games without scoring a goal before Fulham were relegated. He eventually left the club in 2016, with Fulham somehow recouping around half their investment from Benfica. Who then flipped the striker on to Marseille. He was last seen in the German amateur leagues.",
      "",
      "There can only be one. It is thought that Leeds have ultimately stumped up around £40m to ‘sign’ Augustin, who joined in January 2020, played 48 minutes for them and left for Nantes that October.",
      "Their legal department might disagree but Leeds were made to pay Leipzig for the forward when a clause in his loan was triggered upon promotion in lockdown, then had to compensate Augustin himself for breach of contract.",
      "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire described Augustin as ‘the most expensive player in football history in terms of cost per appearance’ at ‘£13,715 per second for Leeds’.",
      "",
      "The weird, desperate purchase of Ben Davies from Preston runs Carroll close, but there can only be one.",
      "No laptop guru worth his charger would possibly have sanctioned a £35m move for a 22-year-old striker with 14 top-flight career goals, yet Liverpool were panicked into such a move in January 2011.",
      "With Fernando Torres headed to Chelsea, a replacement had to be sourced. Newcastle were so stunned that Carroll was the chosen one that they rejected an initial £30m bid. Then Liverpool somehow came back with an extra £5m to get their man.",
      "Carroll became the eighth most expensive footballer – and most expensive British player – ever at the time. He did not make his debut until March, did not score his first goal until April, netted just 11 times in 58 games overall, and was sold for just £15m in 2013. At least Steven Caulker and Ozan Kabak were loans.",
      "",
      "Before Harry Kane officially made it A Thing, Bony was busy scribbling ‘top Premier League scorer in a single calendar year with 20 goals in 2014’ under the achievements section of his CV. And it bloody well worked, as Manchester City were so impressed with the Swansea forward’s productivity that they parted with £25m to sign him and ostracise Edin Dzeko. Ten goals in 46 games hardly convinced the newly-appointed Pep Guardiola that he could lead the line.",
      "",
      "Remember when Manchester United fans were giddy about this one? Remember when swapping lazy, pea-hearted Henrikh Mkhitaryan for street-fighter Alexis Sanchez was seen as a phenomenal deal? Remember the piano and the glee?",
      "Less than three years later, they allowed Sanchez to leave for a free transfer (and had to pay him a wedge themselves), having realised that simply offering the Chilean higher wages than Manchester City did not count as a trophy. Jose Mourinho at least had a chance to gaslight someone.",

      "A transfer so inexplicable that it formed a key part of the Stevens inquiry into football corruption, Newcastle exceeded even themselves in January 2005. Jean-Alain Boumsong had been available as a free agent just six months before Graeme Souness signed him from Rangers for £8m on a five-and-a-half-year contract.",

But that was as good as it got. He failed to net in seven other appearances before being dropped by caretaker-manager Gary Brazil for poor effort and attitude in training. At the end of the season, both parties realised they’d f***ed up and agreed to go their separate ways.",

      "The story of Tottenham’s 2006/07 season should be part of the national curriculum. From finishing fifth in the Premier League to reaching two quarter-finals and one semi-final, there was also a Paul Robinson goal, only the fifth-ever shared Player of the Month award, and Edgar Davids playing alongside Andy Barcham and Dorian Dervite in a League Cup round-of-16 tie.",
      "Just to cement its legacy, Rocha joined for £3.2m plus two friendlies between Tottenham and Benfica, with the Portuguese club keeping all the gate receipts. He would start just 16 games across three seasons.",
      "",
      "The worst January Premier League transfer of all. Savio has faked more of his own kidnappings than he has scored goals in England, despite reigning as West Ham’s club-record signing for four-and-a-half years.",
      "The Hammers thought they had stolen a march on the rest of Europe when they brought the forward in for £9m, Savio having been named in the 2008 Under-19 Euros Team of the Tournament. Yet there was barely a hint of shock when a player who had scored three career goals in 22 games for Serie B side Brescia was lost in the crowd.",
      "After making just one Premier League start, he was sold to Fiorentina for £3m after six months.",

      "Signed by Mick McCarthy and forgotten by Terry Connor in the Premier League, Jonsson actually managed to outlast not only his first two Wolves managers, but also Stale Solbakken and Dean ‘The Scout’ Saunders in the Championship.",
      "The midfielder played just seven times before being released from a contract that had two years remaining in 2013.",
      "Mikel Arteta enjoyed Arsenal proving something they rarely have the chance to, as they took ‘the next step in terms of individual personality and presence’.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo surely cannot continue as West Ham manager after that Wolves debacle, but their £47m January investment means he almost has to stay.",
      "There is no need for football to reinvent itself, just for sustainability to be seen as central rather than peripheral. Following Tottenham would help.",
      "Man Utd should appoint Martin O’Neill with Ruben Amorim reaching the end of the line at Old Trafford in your first Mailbox of the new year.",
      "Enzo Maresca rocking up at Newcastle, with Frank Lampard replacing him at Chelsea, has been forecasted for a 2026 which will end with Arsenal as champions.",
      "Some clubs have obvious candidates for their greatest January transfer window signing ever, like Arsenal and Liverpool. Others need a little more thought."

      "Sunday 4 January 2026 12:24, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across Sunday's games and is tipping both Liverpool and Manchester United to lose.",
      "This fixture is football stripped back to raw emotion and that's exactly where the home side hold the edge. Leeds have been circling this fixture. Daniel Farke doesn't strike you as a man who gambles lightly, so the decision to rest key players in that gritty 0-0 draw with Liverpool looked less like rotation and more like a calculated chess move. Keep the powder dry, take the point and load up for the game that truly matters to the supporters. He's a smart guy.",
      "Many teams down the years have struggled when Leeds sense vulnerability and this version of United still has a soft underbelly away from home. United haven't kept a clean sheet in their last 14 away Premier League games. Leeds look a great bet on the draw no bet at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "When Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo left gaps in Brentford's forward line, there was a question as to where the goals would come from. The answer has been Kevin Schade - he's stepped up and has bagged seven goals already this season.",
      "Brentford deserve huge credit again for that. They keep identifying raw attacking talent and allow it time to develop. Schade's movement between full-back and centre-back is clever, his timing is improving and there's a decisiveness to his finishing now that makes him a player to follow across the goalscorer markets. He's 11/4 to score with Sky Bet - a price that looks a touch of value.",
      "Liverpool arrive unbeaten in eight across all competitions, which on the surface suggests momentum. But unbeaten runs can be misleading when performances haven't materially shifted. Scratch beneath the results and this Liverpool side still looks much like it did earlier in the season in that they are capable of high highs, but prone to lapses that invite pressure.",
      "Remember, this is a team in transition. Evolving roles and an identity still being refined. That doesn't mean they won't be competitive this season, far from it, but it does mean consistency in getting results will hamper them. And that inconsistency is exactly why Fulham will sense an opportunity. They look the play at 7/4 with Sky Bet on the draw no bet.",
      "Crystal Palace's defensive prowess is starting to creak badly. They're conceding two goals per game across their last six matches - and that surface-level output is strongly backed up by the numbers underneath. An expected goals against figure of 1.9 per 90 over that same spell points to opponents carving them open with worrying regularity.",
      "When Newcastle score once, a second usually isn't far behind when playing at St James' Park. Eddie Howe's side have scored two or more goals in their last 10 matches at home which makes the home win and the Toon to score over 1.5 goals a smart bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "This has all the ingredients of a game that flatters to deceive, especially if you listened carefully to the soundtrack coming from the Tottenham end at Brentford in their last game. That 0-0 wasn't just goalless, it was sterile.",
      "The most telling moment came from the stands, with the away end chanting \"boring, boring Tottenham\" and it's usually wise to pay attention when fans start mocking their own team so bluntly. Thomas Frank's side remain short on rhythm, confidence and incision in the final third. With Sunderland's mean defence in town, this could go down another goalless avenue with 10/1 on offer for the 0-0 correct score.",
      "Manchester City's card count at home has quietly crept up. They've been booked 14 times across their last seven home games. That points to a team increasingly forced into recovery challenges and tactical fouls, often a by-product of a change of style that has been implemented by Pep Guardiola as City become more direct.",
      "Chelsea are exactly the type of side to provoke that response. With Joao Pedro, Alejandro Garnacho and Cole Palmer, they possess ball-carriers who invite contact and excel at drawing fouls in transition. Since the start of last season, that trio alone have drawn 45 cards from opposition players. We can back City here at 10/11 with Sky Bet to be shown over 1.5 cards.",

      "Sunday 4 January 2026 11:01, UK",
      "Fourteen losses, 11 draws and 13 wins represent Manchester United's 2025 in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim. But nothing has been more reflective of their uncertain future under the Portuguese boss than his team selections, shape and approach.",
      "In November of 2024, a then-confident and vibrant Amorim, in his first interview with the club, explained the importance of establishing an identity.",
      "\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,\" he told the club's official channels.",
      "\"To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, since day one, we will start with our identity.\"",
      "On the heels of Amorim's first words as United boss was the now infamous 3-4-2-1 set-up. The three defenders, two pivot midfielders in between wing-backs behind a forward line of three, instantly came to define Amorim's United. In September 2025, Amorim said \"not even the Pope\" could change his approach to the game.",
      "Up until recently, his set-up had not changed, and fans and media alike questioned the former Sporting boss' ability to adapt after the approach bore very little fruit. It was an approach new to Old Trafford and its results did very little to inspire. A 15th-placed finish in the league and a Europa League final defeat were its offerings.",
      "While in game, naturally, roles would shift and change and, match to match, there were certain nuances that added difference, the three at the back was a fixture.",
      "In December, though, it was as if a switch had been flicked. As United managed a half-decent run of games, according to Amorim, it felt like the perfect opportunity to finally adapt.",
      "Somewhat forced to relent by Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo departing for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim rejected any notion that outside pressure was to blame for his newfound tactical flexibility.",
      "On Boxing Day, in the win against Newcastle, Amorim started with four at the back for the first time since his appointment.",
      "\"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim ahead of Tuesday's draw with Wolves",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, so we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.\"",
      "But against Wolves, it was back to basics for the Portuguese. A tactical reversion called a \"backwards\" step by Gary Neville as Amorim returned to a back three. But why did he change back, are Man Utd ready to move beyond the back three and what changes has Amorim made to his approach throughout this season?",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser was the first opportunity fans had to see some of the new signings in action. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha started with Mason Mount also named too.",
      "Cunha played centrally, with Mount in the left attacking midfield role and Mbeumo to his right. United finished the game with more possession and twice Arsenal's number of shots.",
      "An early set-piece and Altay Bayindir mistake was the cause of United's defeat but there were immediate signs of a change in attacking approach. United's wing-backs and a willing runner in Mbeumo were impressive as Amorim's side used every occasion they could to send the ball over the top and stretch Arsenal's defence.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: After an underwhelming spell of games following the promise of the Arsenal performance, which included a harrowing loss at Brentford, an under-pressure Amorim travelled to the champions in the hope of securing back-to-back wins for the first time in his Premier League tenure.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was on the bench, despite starting the previous two and United returned to a forward line consisting of Cuhha, Mbeumo and Mount. United took the lead after just two minutes through Mbeumo. His run was rewarded as United caught Liverpool cold with an Amad pass in behind.",
      "United won through an emphatic Harry Maguire winner. But with less possession, United showed a rare staunch defence that managed to keep Liverpool out despite their mounting pressure. The win ensured a first victory for Man Utd at Anfield for almost a decade.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"Every time you play in this environment, if you [low] block well, especially in the beginning, you can feel the fans turning.",
      "\"We feel that in our stadium. All the big teams suffer from that. We tried to do that. I think we have to have more possession to help our players. They struggled in the end. But a good win, let's focus on the next one.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Amorim's first real stark deviation from his three at the back led to one of the more chaotic and entertaining Premier League clashes in recent history.",
      "The personnel said 3-4-2-1 but the positioning disagreed. Leny Yoro's role as a \"secret right-back\" as Gary Neville dubbed it saw him wider and higher than usual. In a 4-2-4 at times, United were able to flow forward freely.",
      "In the first half, United produced the second-highest non-penalty xG of 2.49, most shots (17), and joint-most touches in the opposition's box, with 30, of any side in the Premier League up to that point.",
      "United's attack came to the detriment of United's defensive performance, but it was a showing that gained real plaudits. Amorim showed a flexibility he had not in the past and it appeared to get the most out of his playing squad on the night.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"A fun game. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work on. We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work on, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Full of confidence following on from the Bournemouth game, Amorim's tactical tweaks saw United impress again at Aston Villa. This fixture was the first without Amad and Mbeumo who had joined up with their respective nations for the AFCON.",
      "It was back to Amorim's tried and tested formation; however, United were full of energy, on the front foot and pressing high in another different take of Amorim's approach.",
      "Wing-backs Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot found great joy high and wide with Bruno Fernandes playing higher than usual too, in between Mount and Cunha, who had started in the 10s, behind Sesko.",
      "Fernandes' injury played a part, with Lisandro Martínez replacing him in midfield. That meant Manuel Ugarte stepped into the creative role.",
      "It was also one of United's more defensively secure performances of the six selected. United faced the second fewest shots on target among the selected games, winning possession the most and making the most recoveries. Unfortunately for Amorim, Morgan Rogers' sublime double, either side of Cunha's equaliser, was enough to beat United.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"I think we were the better team today. We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno, but during the game even without him, we were the better team. We did a very good job but no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: A pragmatic Amorim had more tricks up his sleeve as United returned home to face Newcastle. So much so, Eddie Howe seemed to rely on goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale going down in order to gather some tactical thoughts.",
      "Dorgu playing on the right wing was a curious move from Amorim but given the fact he stroked home the winner, any questioning was made obsolete. In the first half, United impressed with Cunha and Dorgu causing Newcastle huge problems.",
      "But the second half was cause for concern. United held on but Newcastle finished the game matching United's 1.2 xG and having 16 shots at Old Trafford to the hosts' nine.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger - to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: As United fell back into a three at the back, so did their predictability. After finding joy with a back four, United's lack of inspiration with a back three was telling.",
      "Amorim made just one change with Joshua Zirkzee replacing the injured Mount but United looked well off the pace. Zirkzee off the right managed to score but that would be his only highlight before he was hooked at half-time.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced by Jack Fletcher and the formation looked closer to United's 4-2-3-1 from the Newcastle win but still Amorim's side struggled to find openings. Wolves, who remain winless in the league, saw their xG trump United's at 1 compared to 0.8 for the home side.",
      "United perhaps did not get the points to show for their performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle, taking just four points, but they competed. Against Wolves, it was a far cry from that, raising the question as to whether United are even ready to evolve from Amorim's approach.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We struggled for the whole game. We had a lack of creativity but we knew that it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game also. If you look at the game, we had our chances, but the fluidity wasn't there because there is a lack of connections.",
      "\"The players tried. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball you struggle even without the ball. We need to recover and to go to the next one.",
      "\"We were running around trying to recover the ball. They overload with a lot of midfielders and we were struggling with that and sometimes you can attack better with less strikers. We played with three strikers, Cunha, Josh and Sesko, and sometimes it is not the best thing to attack well.\"",

      "Burnley's 10-game winless run jumps off the page and most will declare this a home banker at 1/2 with Sky Bet - but dig a little deeper and there are signs of life. Scott Parker has been proactive rather than stubborn, tweaking personnel and roles to try and spark something.",
      "He's found an exciting dynamic in his attack in the Marcus Edwards-Armando Broja pairing, who looked genuinely dangerous against Newcastle. Edwards' ability to receive between the lines and commit defenders gave Burnley a threat they've lacked for weeks, while Broja's power and direct can stretch a backline.",
      "Brighton look vulnerable again priced up as the odds-on favourites. They're six without a win themselves and games at the Amex have recently lacked the control and fluency that once made them so reliable. If Burnley play with the same attacking edge they showed last time out, this could quickly turn into an uncomfortable afternoon for the hosts.",
      "This has all the hallmarks of where a extraordinary run finally snaps.",
      "Wolves reaching the 20th game of the season without a win is the kind of unique run that rarely drags on forever. Football has a habit of correcting these extremes, especially when performances are starting to hint at a shift beneath the surface. And Wolves' recent displays suggest this isn't a team completely lost.",
      "The performances against Liverpool and Manchester United were quietly encouraging. Wolves competed, pressed with purpose and crucially, showed a level of bravery in possession that has been missing at times this season.",
      "West Ham are criminally soft when coming under pressure in games and Wolves may just need one moment to take advantage in what is likely to be an ugly affair. The home side to win by one goal looks a bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "It's currently impossible to build a credible case for Bournemouth against anyone in the Premier League, let alone the league leaders. Their defensive numbers have nosedived to worrying levels and the eye test matches the data. They look open, fragile and far too easy to play through. Conceding 2.25 goals per 90 across their last 12 matches is alarming on its own, but the expected goals against figure of 1.9 per 90 suggests this isn't bad luck, it's an underlying issue that has shown no signs of being fixed.",
      "Arsenal don't need many invitations to punish mistakes and Bournemouth are currently handing them out far too frequently.",

      "United missed out on the chance to go fourth and became the first side to drop points to Wolves since October after a run of 11 consecutive defeats as Amorim's side were booed off by their own fans at Old Trafford.",
      "\"They weren't just booed off at full-time. The fans waited in the stadium to continue to boo them.\"",
      "United were flat from the off but led through Joshua Zirkzee's deflected strike before Wolves scored a deserved equaliser just before half-time through Ladislav Krejci's header.",
      "Neville was surprised Amorim had not stuck with the back four that earned a big win over Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, given his only change was Zirkzee for the injured Mason Mount.",

      "Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Wolves who ended an 11-game losing run in the Premier League.",
      "It was a dismal display by Ruben Amorim's side on a night they could have moved into the top four with a victory, but they could hardly claim to deserve the points as Rob Edwards picked up his first point as Wolves head coach at the eighth attempt.",
      "After beating Newcastle with a back four, Amorim returned to his favoured three-man defence for the visit of Wolves and United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee's shot deflected in off Ladislav Krejci. Benjamin Sesko struck the post soon afterwards.",
      "But United, seeking back-to-back clean sheets for the first time under Amorim, allowed Wolves back into it and needed Senne Lammens to save well from Hugo Bueno even before Zirkzee's misdirected clearance was latched onto by Krejci for the leveller.",
      "Man Utd:  Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Heaven (7), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Casemiro (6), Ugarte (6), Dorgu (6), Zirkzee (6), Cunha (6), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: J Fletcher (6), Yoro (6), Mantato (6).\n\n\nWolves:  Sa (7), Tchatchoua (7), Doherty (7), Mosquera (7), Krejci (7), H Bueno (7), J Gomes (7), Arias (7), Mane (8), Hwang (6), Arokodare (7).\n\n\nSubs: Strand Larsen (6),  Moller Wolfe (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mateus Mane.",
      "Wolves finished the first half with more shots on target and more touches in the opposition box. While United did dominate the second half, they created little, the best chance coming when Jose Sa had to claw a header from his own defender off the line.",
      "Patrick Dorgu did have a goal disallowed for offside in the 90th minute but it would have been scarcely deserved given that it was Lammens who produced the better stops. Amorim's substitutions - including that of Ayden Heaven - only baffled the home crowd.",
      "In failing to beat a team that had lost their last 12 games in all competitions, United missed the chance to move into the top four. Wolves' predicament remains grim, this just their third point of the season. But it was their night. And it is Amorim facing questions.",
      "\"I feel really disappointed. We can't come here at home and draw in this game. We have to win when we play at home and the opponents have to suffer. It is very frustrating.\"",
      "\"We struggled for the whole game. We had a lack of creativity but we knew that it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game also. If you look at the game, we had our chances, but the fluidity wasn't there because there is a lack of connections.",
      "\"The game was completely different from the last one. We had more men behind the ball and when you have more men behind the ball you have to work harder, have more imagination to play the game in a different way. We lacked that quality.",
      "\"The players tried. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball you struggle even without the ball. We need to recover and to go to the next one.\"",
      "\"There will be a painful aftermath for Ruben Amorim. He will point to injuries and AFCON but every team is in a similar situation. I am not sure what happened with Zirkzee. If he is not injured, it is a bizarre substitution to make.\"",
      "\"We had some good chances, at least we take something from the game. It's progress. But yeah I feel like a draw is the least we deserve tonight.",
      "\"At the beginning of the day we were coming here to win. We really believed. To go 1-0 down at Old Trafford can be really difficult but we kept fighting and found a way to get back into it before half-time.",
      "\"We could have taken more from the game but overall the desire from the players was there and that's why the fans were happy at the end.\"",

      "There are extenuating circumstances, clearly. Manchester United are without some of their most creative players right now. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are injured.",
      "But when you draw at home to a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches in all competitions, there will be scrutiny. Particularly when Ruben Amorim switched back to his favoured back three to 'match up' with a side still winless in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim talked of the difficulty in relying on inexperienced players afterwards but he introduced one - Jack Fletcher - when removing Joshua Zirkzee, United's goalscorer, at the interval. \"It was tactical,\" he confirmed. They could not deal with Wolves' midfield, he argued.",
      "If that change was strange, the like-for-like substitution of Ayden Heaven - perhaps United's best outfield player again - for Leny Yoro was also difficult for supporters to understand. They booed that late switch, having booed the team off at half-time and full-time.",
      "Amorim remains confident, he insists, that United will be far stronger when his stars are back but the frustration is that the opportunity is being missed in the here and now. His team could have gone fourth with a better display against the bottom club.",
      "Five of the last seven games in which they have scored first have not been won. Home games against 10-man Everton, a woeful West Ham, a Bournemouth side they were beating three times and now this Wolves team, adrift in the table, have not been won.",
      "And the worry is that Amorim is a big part of the reason for that. The man in whom everyone is supposed to trust sometimes feels like a stumbling block to success rather than the architect of it. Leeds and Burnley await. Those games come with real risk now.Adam Bate",
      "Martin Odegaard's role in Arsenal's second goal against Aston Villa typified all he brings Mikel Arteta's side at his best. First, the off-the-ball alertness to pounce on Youri Tielemans' loose pass. Then a through-ball so perfectly measured that Martin Zubimendi didn't even need to break his stride.",
      "His starring performance at the Emirates Stadium came only three days after he performed to a similarly high level in the win over Brighton. It's a goal and an assist in two games for him now but those numbers do not tell the full story.",
      "After an injury-hit start to the season, the Arsenal captain finally looks back at something approaching his best form. He led Arsenal players for touches, final-third passes, chances created and shots on Tuesday night, his influence clear.",
      "For Mikel Arteta, it was only ever a question of time. \"He needed some consistency as well and some games,\" he said in his press conference. \"Obviously, he had two times the shoulder injury, then he had a big knee injury, and that takes a little bit of time.",
      "\"Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, and that he's affecting the game in a great way.",
      "\"I think he was very, very good today.\"",
      "His work on the ball against Villa was complemented by a familiar level of intensity out of possession. Odegaard contested more duels than any other Arsenal player and won possession the most times too. Only Zubimendi ran further than his 11.2km.",
      "Carry on like this, in all facets of his game, and a player who has come to split opinion among Arsenal supporters could prove a difference-maker in the Premier League title race.Nick Wright",
      "Mateus Mane delivered a player of the match performance for Wolves in their shock draw at Manchester United and in a season in which the supporters have been starved of positives, the 18-year-old academy prospect has become the fans' new darling.",
      "They chanted his name throughout, a new song to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries, and roared with delight when he tackled former favourite Matheus Cunha. Mane played with energy and quality, just days after lasting the full 90 minutes at Anfield.",
      "It is the tactical flexibility that has impressed Rob Edwards. A more natural winger, he was moved inside midway through the game against Liverpool and had been lined up for a No 10 role at Old Trafford until Santi Bueno's withdrawal forced a change of plan.",
      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",
      "Newcastle have looked their best under Eddie Howe when they play with speed, aggression and verticality.",
      "That edge has been missing at times this season, especially away from home.",
      "Where Nick Woltemade offers presence, structure and link play between the lines, Yoane Wissa brings a bit of chaos and directness. He runs the channels, pulls centre-backs wide and asks uncomfortable questions of defensive units that want to hold a compact shape.",
      "Against Burnley, that difference was obvious within minutes and Newcastle managed to score twice inside seven of them.",
      "Two goals in two starts, capped by a decisive contribution in the win over Burnley, has quickly thrust Wissa back into the spotlight.",
      "The early signs suggest Newcastle now have two different attacking profiles for different types of games.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had the suspensions of Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara to add to a four-player injury list against Arsenal. The result was a weakened starting line-up and a depleted bench which included three untested teenagers.",
      "Unai Emery might now have to add Amadou Onana to the absentee list against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Aston Villa were matching Arsenal at the time of his enforced withdrawal due to injury at half-time. It all went wrong after that.",
      "Arsenal were excellent in the second period, of course, but they were also far fresher, with Villa having played out a similarly draining away game against Chelsea only three days earlier. They had gone to their limits to extend their winning run to 11 games.",
      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton boss David Moyes praised his squad, with specific reference to players like Nathan Patterson who came into the game short of regular minutes, following the 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Injuries to Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz for this fixture only added to their problems. Moyes said he was working with around 30 per cent of the squad after the game and he was right.",
      "Through a combination of international duty at AFCON and injuries, Everton are threadbare.",
      "Only two players on their bench this evening - Jack Grealish and Beto - had a Premier League appearance to their name.",
      "The Toffees are within touching distance of the top five but if they want to keep that positioning - or even build on it - they need reinforcements.",
      "Waiting for players to return isn't enough. The January transfer window could be arriving at the perfect time.Patrick Rowe",
      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has praised West Ham's spirit but that only takes you so far. Barring a few Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta moments, there needs to be more quality in this Hammers team, or 2026 is the year they go down.Sam Blitz",
      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "Manchester United appear to have missed out on Antoine Semenyo to Man City and could accelerate their interest in RB Leipzig and Ivory Coast winger Yan Diomande in the January transfer window if other clubs start moving for him, with Bayern Munich and PSG potential rivals",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 19:58, UK",
      "Manchester United are one of the clubs monitoring RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande.",
      "United are not certain to pursue another winger after appearing to miss out on Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City.",
      "But they may accelerate their interest in Diomande if other clubs start moving for the highly rated young forward in this window.",
      "There are other big clubs keen on Diomande, a 19-year-old Ivory Coast international who is currently at the Africa Cup of Nations with United winger Amad Diallo.",
      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-German are also thought to be tracking his development closely.",
      "The teenager has scored seven goals and contributed four assists in 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig this season.",
      "Diomande has started both of Ivory Coast's matches at AFCON and has two goals in five appearances for his country.",
      "Speaking to Marcel Schafer alongside a number of other reporters in September, the RB Leipzig managing director for sport held up Diomande as an example of a \"young jewel\" identified as part of the club's rebuild this season following such a disappointing season.",
      "After eight consecutive European campaigns, Leipzig missed out on continental competition for the first time since their ascension to the German top flight and the signing of Diomande from Spanish side Leganes reflected the need for a refresh.",
      "\"He definitely fits in the profile we are looking for,\" Schafer explained. \"Young, hungry and high potential. Even though he was just six months in Spain, he had really some impressive appearances in LaLiga and we looked for these kind of players.\"",
      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",
      "The teenager scored on his Leipzig debut in the cup before netting in three consecutive appearances in October and bagging a hat-trick against Freiburg just before travelling out to Morocco to represent Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "The prospect of losing Diomande so quickly would not have been part of the plan when they paid €20m to sign him in the summer but Leipzig are pragmatic about their business model, honing young talent and selling them on for a significant profit.",
      "\"Yan is an outstanding talent, a high-potential profile and we exactly looked for this profile. Yes, it was a certain amount we spent but there were so many clubs in competition to sign him. So we are really happy, really proud to sign a young jewel.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
