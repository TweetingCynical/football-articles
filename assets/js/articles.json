      "Ruben Amorim was summoned to Monaco for crunch talks in the wake of Manchester United’s defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. United’s season ended in disaster, with Spurs’ 1-0 win in Bilbao denying them a place in the Champions League and making a crucial summer of recruitment more difficult.",
      "After a dreadful domestic campaign, which saw them finish 15th following a contentious 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day, United were counting on the Europa League to offer solace. But Brennan Johnson’s scrappy goal was hugely damaging for the club’s shaky finances and Amorim, who will now have a task convincing new recruits to join in the summer transfer window.",
      "United reacted by making it clear they would listen to offers for any of their underperforming squad, who have now jetted off to Malaysia for the first of two money-spinning post-season friendlies. But that wasn’t the first flight for Amorim, who travelled to Monaco on Friday to attend a high-profile meeting with the club’s owners and executives.",
      "The meeting takes place every month in INEOS’ spiritual home, but doesn’t normally involve the manager, The Athletic reports. Amorim left having received backing from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the other club bigwigs, but he is under increasing pressure to deliver following a miserable start which has seen him win just 16 of his 42 games in charge.",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final defeat, but before he flew to Monaco, Amorim offered to walk away without compensation. “I have nothing to show to the fans, so at this moment it's a little bit of faith,” said Amorim.",
      "“So let’s see. I'm always open. If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day, without any conversation about compensation. But I will not quit. I'm still really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change anything in the way I do things. I am always really honest.”",
      "He sounded a different note on the Old Trafford pitch, when addressing supporters following the Villa win. “First of all, I want to apologise,” he said. “It was really disappointing with the team. Secondly, I want to say thank you.",
      "\"We are very grateful for your support during the season. I know it was really hard to support us in many games. But now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. Because this season is in the past, it's over.",
      "\"We fight each other or we stick together and move forward. Six months ago, in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw, I said to you a storm is coming. Today, after this disaster season, I want to tell you the good days are coming.”",
      "United are planning to be busy in the summer transfer window, with the £62.5million arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves the first of what the club hopes will be many signings. The club are also in the running to sign Ipswich striker Liam Delap, but Amorim knows he only has around £100m to play with and that sales are therefore key.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are the top priorities when it comes to exits, while Alejandro Garnacho has been told he is not part of Amorim’s plans. He is being targeted by Napoli, while there is also interest from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United have got a massive summer ahead of them after their disastrous season came to a close. The Red Devils rounded off the campaign on a slight high note after beating Aston Villa 2-0 on the final day, but they finished in 15th place after 18 losses and there is much work for Ruben Amorim to do.",
      "Amorim addressed supporters after the Villa game to apologise for a woeful season that also saw them beaten by Premier League rivals Tottenham in the Europa League final - and promised that \"the good days are coming\".",
      "The Red Devils have already started to make moves on both incoming and outgoing moves ahead of next season after confirming Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof would all depart on free transfers, while the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are expected to leave.",
      "Meanwhile, Matheus Cunha is set to be the first name through the door as part of United's rebuild. Amorim will need plenty more names to arrive if he is to restore United to their former glory.",
      "Garnacho's future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain after he was benched for the Europa League final and then left out of the matchday squad entirely for the last game of the season against Villa.",
      "Tensions appear to be growing between the player and Amorim after he scolded his manager's decision - before his brother accused the coach of \"throwing him under the bus\".",
      "Now it seems Napoli could be ready to rescue him from his difficult spell after the Italian side won the Serie A title last week.",
      "According to the i Paper, Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will soon meet with United officials to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho after missing out on him in January.",
      "The Naples outfit had a bid of £40m rejected in January, with United valuing him closer to £70m, but the Italian team could have better luck in striking a bargain after a tough season for the Argentine.",
      "One player Manchester United are hoping to sign is Ipswich's Liam Delap, but they will have to do battle with a number of clubs amid stiff competition for his signature.",
      "Delap is hot property this summer after a superb spell with the Tractor Boys, scoring 12 times in the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are among the teams said to be interested alongside United - but those contenders won't have to wait long before Delap decides on his future.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs reports that Delap is set to decide his next move before he heads off for the Under 21 Euros with England.",
      "The report says United have already held initial discussions with the player, who wants to play European football - though game time is more important for him as he bids to make England's World Cup squad next season.",
      "It adds that Delap would like to return to the North West to play his football, having grown up in Derby and Manchester.",
      "United are edging closer to confirming their first transfer of the new season after reaching agreement to sign Cunha from Wolves, handing him a long-term contract until 2030 with the option of an additional 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils are set to pay the Brazilian's £62.5m release clause, adding some much-needed firepower to a group of players that scored just 44 goals all season - the fifth lowest of any team in the Premier League this season.",
      "Cunha is understood to have been offered the No 10 shirt at Old Trafford - meaning that number will be stripped from Marcus Rashford, who is likely to leave the club in the summer after his loan spell with Aston Villa.",
      "And now the Brazilian has sent a message to Wolves fans following the end of the season - which appears to be a goodbye message.",
      "\"Wolves, what can I say to you?\" he said. \"What an incredible season. We didn’t get to where you deserve to be, but we did everything we could to make you proud. I love these guys.\"Individually, it was the best season of my life. All of this was only possible because of all the dedication and love I have for this club. I became the Brazilian with the most goals in a Premier League season, along with @roberto_firmino and @gabriel.martinelli. \"I made mistakes and got things right, but always because I lived this club so much.

I don’t deny that there have been possibilities over the last few years, even when I was at Lazio, but I was happy at Lazio and I’m happy at Inter. I like it (English football), it intrigues me, but I’m at one of the best teams in Europe and I’m happy here. Nobody can be certain about the future, though.\"",

He's a good character, a great trainer. I know a little bit about the boy and I think that's the background.\"",
      "That testimony to the player's moral fibre describes exactly the profile of player Amorim could have used more this season. Too often did United take the lead in games this season, only to welcome pressure upon themselves, while their 18 defeats are the most they've recorded in a league campaign in more than half a century.",
      "To Ten Hag's credit, the Dutchman said in October that he \"didn't want\" to see McTominay leave in a decision that was more so pushed by the club. McTominay appeared to confirm as much in December when he told the BBC Football Daily podcast Financial Fair Play (FFP) was a factor.",
      "Much of United's transfer travails in the post-Ferguson era come down to prioritising the wrong profile of player. The club has spent vast sums bringing in big names or expensive prospects who often don't fit the bill in their positions, frequently overlooking certain intangibles that McTominay possesses.",
      "\"I signed [McTominay] when he was seven or eight years of age and he was actually a centre-forward as a kid,\" added Ferguson in 2021. \"He's just sprouted, a little bit like Darren Fletcher. Darren had a few little annoying injuries as he was growing and needed some rest periods and things like that.",
      "\"McTominay is of a similar type to Darren - long, lanky, good winner of the ball and a good turn of pace going forward, a great attitude to the game. All these attitudes that Darren Fletcher had, he's got them.\"",
      "Ferguson, 83, developed a knack for recruiting somewhat under-the-radar talents who made his teams greater than the sum of their parts. And these players often had a hand in making the glossier names on the team sheet shine, with Park Ji-sung, Nemanja Vidic and John O'Shea perhaps among the best examples.",
      "The £25m or so United received for McTominay's signature may look like a pittance now, considering what he has achieved in Italy. It's fair to say the Red Devils' loss was Napoli's gain as he took to Italian football with ease, displaying the kind of all-action midfield presence that was plain to see in his last season at Old Trafford."

      "Ruben Amorim reduced his Sporting CP squad to tears when he left the club in November to take the reins of Manchester United. The Portuguese tactician enjoyed a stellar four-year stint with the Primeira Liga side between 2020 and 2024, winning three league titles and three domestic cups before the Red Devils spent £11million to bring him and his coaching staff to Old Trafford.",
      "And while Amorim has had a far-from-stellar season with United, winning just eight Premier League games since taking over from Erik ten Hag and finishing a record low 15th in the standings, it is clear that the 40-year-old is able to build budding relationships with his players.",
      "That is, of course, if his former Sporting CP squad's opinions of him are anything to go off. As per Abola, Eduardo Quaresma broke down in tears in the wake of Amorim leaving the club last year, telling the publication: \"I was sad, we had a very good relationship with the manager, I feel sad for him, he deserves everything good.",
      "\"I don't believe it. There were times when I didn't believe it would happen. I don't know if I can say it. We had a meeting and he said to us, 'Guys, I don't know anything, trust me.'",
      "\"The next game, the guy said he was leaving, but he stayed for another four games. All I could think was, 'Go away'. I cried a lot. I think I cried the most.\"",
      "Quaresma was not the only player who was emotional as Amorim parted ways with the European stalwarts either, with Pedro Goncalves also noting an incredibly strong relationship with his former manager. The attacking midfielder said: \"I wouldn't be here today [without him].",
      "\"We had a very strong bond, both professionally and personally. He liked my wife very much and was concerned about my well-being, both on the field and in my family life.",
      "\"He knew when players were happy or sad, and he knew exactly what to say. We were sad. I started crying because I really liked him, and I was sad. I never told him not to go; I wished him good luck. The players understood. He was like a father to us. We were sad, but we understood. I wish him the best of luck.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Maximiliano Araujo, who was brought to the Jose Alvalade by Amorim last summer, highlighted the impact that the manager had on not only him, but the squad as a whole. He revealed to Abola his disappointment in seeing Amorim leave for United: \"It was normal.",
      "\"I noticed it, yes, in many of my team-mates, because it was normal. That's what I'm telling you. When you have a really good coach like that, you don't want him to leave. When so many players cry... I have no doubt that many players felt a lot of affection for him. And, yes, it was a bit difficult. As I say... it was normal, understandable, given all the affection the players felt for him.\"",
      "After Amorim's exit from Sporting CP, Joao Pereira took the reins of the club for a month before he was replaced by Rui Borges in December.",
      "And the 43-year-old not only managed to guide his team to a Taca de Portugal trophy, but also to beat rivals Benfica to a Liga Portugal title by two points. It comes as Amorim held his hands up for a lacklustre first season at Old Trafford, as he has failed to get his inherited squad to adapt to his patented style of play.",
      "While the manager was able to oversee a 2-0 win over Aston Villa during Sunday's seasonal finale at Old Trafford - courtesy of goals from Amad and Christian Eriksen - the victory came as all but a consolation prize from an otherwise dreadful term. Addressing fans from the pitch after the full-time whistle, Amorim said: \"First of all, I want to apologise for this season.",
      "\"I know you are really disappointed with me, and really disappointed with the team. Second thing, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support during the season, and I know that was really hard.",
      "\"I know it was really hard in many ways, but now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past - because this season is in the past. It's over. We fight each other, or we stick together and move forward.",
      "\"Six months ago, in my first three games in charge with two victories and one draw, I said to you, 'The storm is coming.' Today, after this disaster season, I want to tell you, the good days are coming. If there is one club in the world that proved in the past, that can overcome any situation, any disaster, it's our club. It's Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"Now I want to say sorry also to my players. Sometimes I was not fair, but I tried always to be honest to you guys. Thank you very much, see you next season.\"",

      "Having joined the Red Devils from Ajax in 2022, Ten Hag won two trophies - the League Cup and FA Cup - over the course of his tumultuous tenure. Ten Hag's position was under threat last season following an eighth-place finish before United's new hierarchy decided on keeping him.",
      "The ex-Ajax, Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles boss was then backed with £200million in the summer, but failure to improve results led to his dismissal. Ten Hag was patient after departing Old Trafford, focussing on ventures outside of football.",
      "It's understood that he wanted to wait until the summer to return to management. And his patience has paid off with a move to former Bundesliga champions Leverkusen.",
      "Ten Hag said: \"Bayer 04 are one of the best clubs in Germany and also among the top clubs in Europe. The club offers outstanding conditions, I've been very impressed with the discussions of the management.",
      "\"I've come to Leverkusen to continue with the ambition shown in recent years. It's an attractive challenge to set up something together in this period of change and develop an ambitious team.\"",
      "Sporting director Simon Rolfes added: \"With Erik ten Hag we have brought in an experienced coach with impressive success on the pitch. His six title wins at Ajax were exceptional. With three league titles and two domestic cup wins he and Ajax dominated Dutch football from 2018 to 2022.",
      "\"And Erik demonstrated his quality as a coach with the ensuing success at Manchester United under difficult circumstances at times. Our ideas of football coincide. With technically demanding and dominant football, we want to carry on in the Werkself style and aim for the highest targets in the Bundesliga, DFB Pokal and Champions League.\"",
      "They've confirmed that Ten Hag has signed a contract until 2027. Unfortunately for the 55-year-old, he's set to miss out on the chance to coach some of Leverkusen's best players who helped them win the title in 2024.",
      "Defender Jonathan Tah has opted not to sign a new contract and will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer. Meanwhile, star attacker Florian Wirtz and highly-rated wing-back Jeremie Frimpong are both in talks to join Liverpool, potentially banking Leverkusen close to £150m.",

      "Recently, Ten Hag opened on life outside of coaching. \"There are so many other things I could do,\" he told the SEG Stories podcast. \"Maybe in football, in a new position as a manager. That's an option. And maybe something completely different.\"",
      "\"I've been working with my brothers lately. We have our own company. Or rather; they have their own company. But we also run a company together with our father. That's also something I love to do I can now give that more attention and it's also a lot of fun.\""

      "I am sick and tired of managers saying they are going to stick to their principles. What? At the expense of results? If you do not have the players to play a certain formation, then change. It is a weakness and inflexibilibity. Not a strength. He has underperformed to whole new levels.",

To win against one of the teams in English football history in Manchester City, is just sensational. But it was the fans. Oliver Glasner. They turned Wembley blue and red. What an upset.

      "After his breakthrough last season, we expected so much from the player who scored in the FA Cup final and started for England in the Euros final but injuries, manager change and a struggle to fit into a new system has seen him struggle for most of the campaign. Will be hoping to bounce back next term.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Signed for £12m from Juventus and sold for £50m already to Real Madrid. From a financial perspective it couldn't have been a better move from Bournemouth but the Spain defender was also brilliant this season for the Cherries.",
      "Worst transfer: Jadon Sancho",
      "\"Freedom\" he said about Marcus Rashford's move to Aston Villa but he didn't use his own \"freedom\" to prove Manchester United wrong and now Chelsea are going to pay £5m to send him back instead of taking up the £25m obligation to buy him. That tells its own story.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Their first ever major trophy and beating big boys Manchester City at Wembley. The scenes were epic and it should be a reminder to every mid-table team manager who plays a weakened team in the Cup what those days can bring for fans.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Sometimes a new manager doesn’t need to take a sledgehammer to what’s gone before, and instead just needs a subtle touch. That’s what Slot brought to Anfield, tweaking things here and there with the same players that Jurgen Klopp had in his final season as they finished off the title pace. He rejuvenated some players, got a little bit extra out of others and led them to the title, comfortably, with an understated confidence throughout.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Arrived at Manchester United with a growing reputation, supposedly the ace who was meant to right the ship and turn them into challengers once again. Instead, seven months down the line, he looks like little more than a busted flush. It’s going to take some turnaround next season to prove he isn’t just someone able to do it in a second tier league but found badly wanting in our top flight; the Ricky van Wolfswinkel of Premier League managers, if you will.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "For the majority of the season, has been on another level to the rest of the Premier League. Hat tips to Newcastle’s Alexander Isak and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who doesn’t get anywhere near the credit he deserves.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Pau Cubarsi",
      "OK it’s not the Premier League, but for the Barcelona defender to do what he’s done in his first full season at senior level, to play as many games, with seemingly a different partner every other week - not to mention in Hansi Flick’s ridiculously aggressive defensive line - all at the age of 18 is nothing short of incredible.",
      "Biggest disappointment: West Ham",
      "It couldn’t be Manchester United, because seeing that level of failure while Sir Jim Ratcliffe sacks staff left, right and centre while pleading poverty at a club with revenues the size of theirs isn’t a disappointment.",
      "Tottenham save themselves thanks to their Europa League triumph and Joao Felix doesn’t get picked either because I’m still uncertain if he’s a beautiful mirage or not.",
      "So I’ll go with West Ham. Julen Lopetegui spent a lot and some of his press pals gave it the big build up - then continued to make clear how right he was and how it was everybody else who was wrong as things went from bad to worse. It's not got much better under Graham Potter either.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "In these days of everyone wanting defenders who can play, it’s good to see a big solid unit just being absolutely dominant in his own box and defending like his life depends on it. Has been brilliant for Forest for only £12million.",
      "Worst transfer: Riccardo Calafiori",
      "He cost £47million when they already had two left-backs - and then had Myles Lewis-Skelly coming through anyway! He’s not a bad player the Italian, but it wasn’t necessary from Arsenal when they had obvious other needs.",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the FA Cup",
      "Quite simply what football is all about.",
      "Team of the year: David Raya; Daniel Munoz, Nikola Milenkovic, Virgil van Dijk, Marc Cucurella; Alexis Mac Allister, Bruno Guimaraes, Declan Rice; Mo Salah, Bryan Mbeumo; Alexander Isak",
      "Best manager:",
      "It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager:",
      "In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",
      "Best player:",
      "Mo Salah - the Egyptian king’s contract stand-off at Anfield was a distraction from his 29 goals and 18 assists. Absolutely phenomenal.",
      "Best breakthrough season:",
      "Dean Huiijsen - if you’d never heard of him before this season, he was the £50 million defender snapped up by Real Madrid after an impressive season for Bournemouth.",
      "Biggest disappointment:",
      "West Ham - a wasted season. Julen Lopetegui wasn’t an obvious fit at the Taxpayers Stadium and his results soon showed why. In a year when Tottenham and Crystal Palace won trophies, the Hammers weren’t even at the races.",
      "Best transfer:",
      "Nikola Milenkovic - he brought steel and assurance to Nottingham Forest’s unlikely pursuit of Champions League football. OK, they ended up in the Thursday Night Smorgasbord Conference, but at £12m he was a steal.",
      "Worst transfer:",
      "Raheem Sterling - his season on loan at Arsenal yielded a solitary goal, against Bolton in the League Cup, and he spent most of it on the bench. At Euro 2020 he was England’s best player, but his star has fallen so far even astronomers can’t find it in the solar system now.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser for Everton in the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Bedlam, controversy, madness, passion. All the things we love about football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Worst manager: Julen Lopetegui",
      "Best player: Mohamed Salah",
      "Best breakthrough season: Morgan Rogers",
      "Biggest disappointment: Premier League teams against PSG",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "Worst transfer: Nico Gonzalez",
      "Biggest moment: Rodri’s injury",
      "Team of the year: Raya; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Rice; Salah, Wissa, Isak",
      "For all the impressive work done by some of the Premier League’s surprise packages this season, it’s hard to look past dominant champions Liverpool. In other years, Nuno Espirito Santo’s efforts might earn him manager of the year, but Arne Slot’s seamless work after following Jurgen Klopp earns him the nod.",
      "Forest do get a nod in my team of the year, with Nikola Milenkovic gelling brilliantly with Murillo in one of the most impressive defences in the league. Matz Sels and Chris Wood are also close to inclusion but just miss out, with Liverpool and Arsenal the only teams with multiple representatives - though it’s worth noting that none of Arsenal’s three are attackers.",
      "Former Manchester City youngster Morgan Rogers edges out his one-time Under-21s colleague Liam Delap in the breakthrough category by virtue of his Champions League exploits, but both have shown they’re more than ready to thrive at this level.",
      "The biggest disappointments - aside from PSG going three for three against English sides in the Champions League knockouts - are two Spaniards. Julen Lopetegui wasted a big-spending summer in his half-season at West Ham, while £49m Nico Gonzalez hasn’t even been Manchester City’s best Nico, let alone their best player.",
      "City’s title defence - or lack thereof - has been the story of the season. Rodri’s September injury accelerated their decline, and his return could yet be one of the factors when the time comes for end-of-season assessments 12 months from now.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "It is hard to look past a man who wins the title in their first season in the Premier League despite having made no major signings. Slot has led Liverpool roaring to top spot, easily handling the job of replacing Jurgen Klopp.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "At the other end of the scale, Ruben Amorim has been disastrous for Manchester United. He has won just six Premier League games, with a points per game average of 0.92. If he'd have been in charge for the full season, United may well have been in a relegation battle.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Once again, I'm going route one with this award. Mo Salah has been by far the best player in the Premier League this term. In a season in which his contract was expiring, Salah has delivered a historic performance, scoring 33 goals and notching 23 assists in all competitions.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "The 18-year-old made his debut back in September as a last second sub in Arsenal's draw with Manchester City. He has since become the Gunners' first-choice left-back and looks set to enjoy a successful career at the top level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Phil Foden",
      "The reigning Premier League Player of the Year has endured a woeful season. He has scored just seven goals and notched only two assists in the top-flight. The midfielder looks far from the player many pundits wanted England to build their team around.",
      "Best transfer: Liam Delap",
      "OK so Ipswich went down, but Liam Delap has enjoyed an impressive season leading the line for the Tractor Boys. The striker has scored 12 goals and notched two assists. He looks likely to leave Portman Road in a £40m deal this summer.",
      "Worst transfer: Manuel Ugarte",
      "Bought for £50million, Manuel Ugarte has endured a difficult debut season in the Premier League. He has failed to solve United's midfield problems and has struggled to convince boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's goal vs Liverpool",
      "With just seconds remaining of the final Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park, Everton were trailing 2-1. But then James Tarkowski smashed in a volley to equalise, sending the Toffees into delirium. It had the added benefit of ensuring that the Merseyside Derby record at Goodison Park ended up with 41 wins for each side and 38 draws.",
      "Team of the year: Matz Sels; Tino Livramento; Virgil van Dijk, Nikola Milenkovic, Milos Kerkz; Youri Tielemans, Declan Rice, Bruno Guimaraes; Mo Salah, Chris Wood, Josh Murphy",
      "Best manager: Nuno Espirito Santo",
      "It's sometimes forgotten in this era that a manager's job is to make the best of the players that he has and win games. For me, no one has done that better than Nuno Espirito Santo, doubling Nottingham Forest's points tally from last season, a Premier League first.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric",
      "I liked him in Italy but sorry, you can't escape his abysmal results.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Talismanic.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Ryan Gravenberch",
      "A lesson in not judging players too early. Good job for him that Liverpool never signed Martin Zubimendi.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "All change at the top yet the same mess on the pitch. But the Europe-less nadir that they've reached could actually force a hard reset.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "Talk about turning a profit, he cost Bournemouth £12.6million and was sold to Real Madrid for £50m just 34 appearances later.",
      "Worst transfer: Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall",
      "Premier League-only, of course. Chelsea paid £30m for 258 minutes of football.",
      "Biggest moment: Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City",
      "The power truly shifted that day.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Munoz, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Hall; Mac Allister, Tonali, Rice; Salah, Isak, Mbeumo",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot.",
      "Boring answer, but anyone who tells you they thought he’d win the league in his first season, with Federico Chiesa as the only summer signing is lying.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim.",
      "I bought into the hype, but it’s been a car crash so far – United’s squad is poor but he should’ve done far better and there have been some indefensible decisions along the way.",
      "Best player: Mohamed Salah.",
      "He’s tailed off a little of late – who can blame him? – but he’s been absolutely electric.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Jacob Murphy.",
      "At the age of 30, it has all clicked for the Newcastle winger, who is a lot better than I thought he was. A great story.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Southampton.",
      "Russell Martin’s style of play was always going to lead to some hairy moments, but they’ve been an embarrassment, plumbing the depths of Premier League history.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic.",
      "Everything you want from a signing: he was a bargain at £12m, has played every week for Nottingham Forest and been extremely consistent.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix.",
      "He cost £45m and has one Premier League goal. A player Chelsea didn’t need but went for anyway. A colossal waste who epitomises Chelsea’s buy now and question later policy.",
      "Biggest moment: James Tarkowski's last-minute equaliser vs Liverpool.",
      "A wonderful bit of unfiltered raw emotion in the last Merseyside Derby at Goodison Park.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Livramento, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Rogers; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Winning PL in first season is not to be sniffed at although if Nuno secures top-five, he’s my manager of season.",
      "Worst manager: Julen Lopetegui",
      "Shocking, should never have landed the job, wasn’t an upgrade on David Moyes.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Slowed down but in the thick of it, Salah provided big moments and put huge numbers on board again.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Liam Delap",
      "Always been highly rated but cracked the Prem to prove he belongs at this level.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Man Utd",
      "Ridiculous season having spent big again last summer.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "Bargain, colossal at the back for Forest, incredible business.",
      "Worst transfer: Sterling to Arsenal",
      "Spent a lot of time contacting people about this deal on deadline day and it was effectively much ado about nothing, really poor for all parties.",
      "Biggest moment: Palace winning FA Cup",
      "Not Prem related but a monumental achievement and underdog story that restores your faith in football.",
      "Team of the year: Sels; Munoz, Van Dijk, Milenkovic, Kerkez; Mac Allister, Rice, Gibbs-White; Salah, Mbeumo, Isak.",
      "Best manager: Oliver Glasner",
      "I know Arne Slot won the title in his first season but Oliver Glasner won Crystal Palace’s first trophy after 164 years.",
      "Worst manager: Ivan Juric/Russell Martin",
      "Take your pick at Southampton but they had no chance of survival after one win in 16 under Russell Martin.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "Honourable mention to Alexander Isak but Mo Salah has been different class.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbian centre-back has been an outstanding signing for Nottingham Forest.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Chelsea.",
      "A team of inexperienced players with an inexperienced manager.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen.",
      "Bought for £13m from Juventus and sold for £50m to Real Madrid after an excellent season at Bournemouth.",
      "Worst transfer: Raheem Sterling.",
      "Arsenal desperately needed a goalscorer. They took the Chelsea winger on loan and he scored one Carabao Cup goal in 27 appearances.",
      "Biggest moment: Liverpool 2 Man City 0 February 23.",
      "The official changing of the guard at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "Liverpool fans won’t like it but the fact that the Dutchman has won the title in his first season in England indicates that Jurgen Klopp might not have been the genius they claimed.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "An easy conclusion given that Amorim himself reckons he’s the worst manager in United’s history.",
      "Best player: Virgil van Dijk",
      "The Kop captain has been the rock on which the title success has been built.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "It’s always great to see a talented young player emerge at the club he supports. But Lewis-Skelly also has a bit of devil about him that makes him extra special. His Erling Haaland impression was a stand-out moment.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Refereeing standards and VAR",
      "And Howard Webb trying to suggest our officials are doing a good job is offensive.",
      "Best transfer: Dean Huijsen",
      "An absolute steal at £13m - and any club that meets his £60m buy-out will also be getting a bargain.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Spending £46million on the Portuguese striker may have been driven by FFP and PSR considerations but has there ever been a bigger waste of money?",
      "Biggest moment: Crystal Palace winning the first trophy in their history and what it meant to their fans.",
      "Team of the year: Newcastle edged out Nottingham Forest on the final day. For Eddie Howe to win the club’s first major trophy for 70 years AND qualify for the Champions League means he’s surely going to get a statue commissioned.",
      "Best manager: Arne Slot",
      "There are other worthy contenders, such as Nottingham Forest's Nuno Espirito Santo and Newcastle's Eddie Howe, but to win the title in his first season at Liverpool, with effectively the same squad he inherited from Jurgen Kloop, was a remarkable achievement from Slot.",
      "Worst manager: Ruben Amorim",
      "Manchester United fans may sing his name and he may yet turn the club around in time, but seven wins from 28 Premier League games is shocking and would have seen them in danger of relegation in any other season.",
      "Best player: Mo Salah",
      "An obvious choice, but with 29 goals and 18 assists in the Premier League this season, a modern-day record for goal involvements, it is hard to look beyond the Liverpool forward as player of the season.",
      "Best breakthrough season: Myles Lewis-Skelly",
      "He only made his first Premier League start in December, but the left-back, 18, has made the position his own and earned an England call-up with his fearless attitude and confidence on the ball.",
      "Biggest disappointment: Manchester United",
      "Even with the upheaval of changing managers mid-season, to finish 15th and lose 18 games is wholly unacceptable for such a big club, with the calibre of players they have and the financial resources at their disposal.",
      "Best transfer: Nikola Milenkovic",
      "The Serbia defender had an incredible debut season for Forest after signing from Fiorentina for £12million, forming a formidable central defensive partnership with Murillo and taking them to the brink of the Champions League, until the final day.",
      "Worst transfer: Joao Felix",
      "Once regarded as one of Europe's hottest young talents, Chelsea spent £45m on the 25-year-old, who made three Premier League starts before being shipped out on loan to AC Milan. A calamitous and costly signing.",
      "Biggest moment: Manchester City's collapse",
      "Maybe not a single moment, more of a seismic spell, but City's return of five points from 27 from November 2 to December 26 was the shock of the season, given their relentless consistency of recent years, and ultimately handed the title to Liverpool.",
      "Team of the year: Liverpool",
      "Again, there are other worthy contenders, such as Newcastle and Nottingham Forest, but winning the Premier League at a canter, with a new manager at the helm, following a managerial icon in Jurgen Klopp, makes Arne Slot's side the team of the year.",
      "Best manager: It’s got to be Arne Slot - he had the good sense to leave the side he inherited from Jurgen Klopp alone, like Claudio Ranieri inheriting Nigel Pearson’s team at Leicester in 2015, and they both won the title unexpectedly.",
      "Worst manager: In a crowded field, it’s got to be Ruben Amorim - not just for finishing the season without a trophy at Manchester United, but his refusal to adapt that sacrosanct 3-4-3 formation. Systems don’t win football matches, players do. Stick to your principles or stick ‘em in the bin? Amorim’s given us all the answer.",

      "Team of the year: Sels; Timber, Milenkovic, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Rice, Gravenberch, Guimaraes; Salah, Isak, Eze.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

Heading out the door will be Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose move to Real Madrid will soon be confirmed after his teary farewell to Anfield on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal haven't wasted time either, with midfielder Martin Zubimendi set to complete his long-awaited £51m move to the Emirates after he said his goodbyes to Real Sociedad. Now their search for a striker is taking centre stage, with Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres their No.1 target following his incredible 53-goal season.",

      "Small details must be clarified with the defender and then Liverpool will contact the Cherries it is said.",

      "Manchester United's season has finally come to an end and, although they ended with a win, it has been a year to forget. This summer's transfer window is now being targeted by Ruben Amorim as he eyes major changes.",
      "He's been unable to enjoy any positive change since being appointed late last year, but will be granted a summer to get in the players that suit his unique style. He's likely to need several new faces whilst numerous individuals are deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "United's failure in the Europa League final means they missed out on the Champions League, which has massively hit their finances. It may hamper what they can do, but they are still tipped to pursue Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap.",

      "The 40-year-old plans to improve the players United already have after a disastrous start to his tenure at Old Trafford with their balance book massively controlling what they can do.",
      "\"You know better than me that we have rules with FFP,\" Amorim said following the final match of the season. \"We can't change that in this year. We need to do something in the summer. We have a plan and we are doing that in a while. We also have a preseason to improve the players we have.\"",
      "Christian Eriksen has confirmed he will leave Manchester next month. The Dane will depart officially at the end of June when his contract expires. Eriksen marked his final appearance for the club by netting a penalty in their 2-0 triumph on the final day. He stepped off the bench in the second half and was given the opportunity to score in the closing minutes as he enjoyed the perfect send off.",
      "\"It has been an exciting few years being in this stadium and playing for this club. I have enjoyed it and I take a lot of good memories with me.\"",
      "It was also confirmed that Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof will be leaving this summer.",
      "Amorim insisted that Alejandro Garnacho had not appeared for United for the final time - despite missing out on the Red Devils win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season. It has been suggested that the winger is on his way out of the club after a furious outburst following the Europa League final.",
      "The Argentina international has three years left on his contract at Old Trafford but was linked with moves to Chelsea and Napoli earlier this season, and could offer a profitable player to offload as United make every player available for sale.",

      "The Red Devils eventually went on to win 2-0. It was a result that saw Villa miss out on a place in the Champions League. They eventually finished sixth in the Premier League.",

      "\"Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the 2nd least experienced. The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",

A statement on Sunday afternoon read: \"The referee’s call was a free kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession. The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",

      "Christian Eriksen said farewell to Old Trafford on the final day of the Premier League season. He volunteered to chat, which promised to be good value considering he could speak freely.",
      "Eriksen is about to walk through the exit door and can say anything he likes about United.",
      "“I think, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of lows this season with the games, and obviously the final was the missing piece. It’s football,\" he said, before producing a zinger relegation quote.",
      "“For me now, I think people are lucky that we are where we are, not relegated with the team with the season we’ve had, so it is also a bit of luck you have to acknowledge. Next season it has to be better, and I’m sure it will be. I’m looking forward to watching it from the sides.”",
      "United should probably be thankful for Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton.",
      "In December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe showed his true colours when he discussed the increase of ticket prices.",
      "In Ratcliffe's United We Stand interview, he said of the anger at the ticket price rises: \"I understand that. I was brought up on a council estate in Manchester, I absolutely get that.",
      "\"I don't want to end up in a position where the genuine local fans can't afford to come, but I do want to optimise the ticketing. We need to find a balance. And you can't be popular all the time either. Here, we're talking about three per cent of the tickets. That's not the issue.",
      "\"The issue, as you say, is whether this is the thin edge of the wedge. I don't think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.\"",
      "Told that wages are higher in London, Ratcliffe continued: \"I get that. I'm not sure there's an answer that keeps everybody happy, but we need to keep the majority happy.\"",
      "Ratcliffe's comments certainly didn't go down well among supporters and he was subsequently confronted outside Craven Cottage, with an angry fan telling the British billionaire he was \"worse than the Glazers.\"",
      "United were hammered 3-0 by Liverpool at Old Trafford at the beginning of September.",
      "Ten Hag got into a fiery argument with a reporter who questioned his tactics.",
      "Ian Ladyman from the Daily Mail asked Ten Hag what made him so sure it was the players that were the problem and not his coaching, to which the Dutchman responded: \"So, what do you mean? Tell me then, maybe you can explain me which mistakes we make regular?”",
      "Ladyman said: “Constantly turning over the ball in your own half, playing the ball out from the back, getting mugged, chances coming off the back of it, counter attacks where you are outnumbered, giving up endless chances.”",
      "Ten Hag replied: “You are sure? I don’t think so,\" and Ladyman responded: “Absolutely.”",
      "Ten Hag added: “I don’t think otherwise we would win trophies as we did and to beat big opponents, so I am sorry for you.”",
      "The journalist responded: “With the greatest respect, you did brilliantly against Manchester City in the final, you almost lost to Coventry in the semi-final I mean come on let’s have a realistic view of what happened.”",
      "Ten Hag ended the exchange with: “I think we won, after City, the most trophies in English football, so I’m sorry for you.”",
      "Many believed Ten Hag was crumbling under pressure and sounded out of touch with reality."

      "Without the attraction of Champions League football to offer to prospective signings this summer, Manchester United could face an uphill struggle from the start in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "United missed out on the opportunity to secure their place back in Europe's premier club competition after being beaten 1-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in last Wednesday evening's Europa League final at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao.",
      "After a wretched Premier League campaign, United knew their last hope of securing any form of European football for next season rested on beating Spurs. However, Brennan Johnson's first half prod brought that dream to an end.",
      "As a result, United will go without any form of European football for the first time since the 2014/15 season.",
      "Champions League qualification alone is worth just north of £15.5million, with the additional bonuses, such as gate receipts and broadcast money, increasing the revenue that can be generated as a result of dining at European football's top table to at least £85m.",
      "With the squad needing to be gutted and £89m owed in transfer fees from previous windows, United's failure to secure additional revenue streams is a massive blow ahead of what promises to be one of the biggest transfer windows the club has ever faced.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim wants to make wholesale changes to the squad. However, now that Champions League football won't be on offer, United will find it hard to attract players who will believe they belong in Europe's premier club competition.",
      "Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres, for example, has been heavily linked with a reunion with Amorim at Old Trafford in recent months. However, his tally of six goals in eight Champions League games this season will have him believing that his next move should be to a club that is competing in Europe's premier club competition.",
      "As disappointing and as damaging as it is that United will not compete in Europe next season, one thing that could work to their advantage is that players who are drafted in will be joining the club because they want to play for United.",
      "Top players aspire to play in Europe, particularly the Champions League, meaning any player who joins United this summer will be doing so because they want to experience the thrill and pressure of playing for one of the world's most famous clubs.",
      "United need to recruit players who will roll up their sleeves, fight and give their all, regardless of what competitions United may or may not be competing in.",
      "Amorim has highlighted the need for changes to be made this summer countless times, meaning one of the biggest keys to overseeing the right level of changes will be recruiting players of the right character. Players who genuinely want to be at Old Trafford are what they should be looking for.",
      "Regardless of talent levels or ability, character and mentality can be equally important. Former United manager Erik ten Hag, back in August 2022, highlighted the importance of recruiting the right characters, assessing the impact they would have on the dressing room.",
      "The Dutchman said: \"Of course you analyse your squad … what are the weaknesses, what are the strengths and where can we improve? Which players are on the market?",
      "\"But it's also really important that you know the characters of your current squad and also the players that you bring in…what characters and behaviour they have. And what the effect, or probable effect, they will have in the dressing room.\"",
      "Of course, United need to add quality to their squad this summer, and getting a deal over the line for Matheus Cunha will do exactly that. And the fact he is keen to join United in their current situation is a big positive.",
      "United need to recruit players who are simply not using the club as a gateway to play in the Champions League. Players joining the club this summer will be doing so because of their ambition to represent English football's biggest institution."

      "Fifteenth in the Premier League and trophyless officially marks the worst Manchester United season in 51 years. In the end, their league position was better than anticipated.",
      "The unexpected final-day victory over Aston Villa saw United end an eight-game winless league run and rise to a flattering 15th. They even broke the 40-point mark.",
      "Although there is a post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong to navigate over the next week, the domestic season could not have ended quickly enough for United. Progression in the Europa League made the season salvageable but United lost to the worst Tottenham team since they were last relegated.",
      "Here are how the United players rated in 2024-25:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "It is easy to forget how secure Onana was in the first three months. That changed after Arsenal cornered him and he committed too many clangers, with the nadir away to Lyon. 4",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Played ten times and was the hero of the FA Cup triumph at Arsenal but he was almost always unconvincing, including in the only Premier League match United won with him in net against Aston Villa. 4",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Started to make some headway in March and early April but his form before then was nondescript. United missed him when he was injured but they need a new right winger. 4",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "One of United's most consistent performers. Mazraoui missed one game through illness and played in seven different roles. He is lacking in attack but is a valuable squad player in defence and provided value for money. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "On an individual basis, possibly his best campaign with United. Maguire scored huge goals, was more often than not solid defensively and has become a captain without the armband. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Struggled in his first six months but found form in March before he sustained injury at Nottingham Forest at the start of April, which effectively ended his season prematurely. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not debut until December after he recovered from a metatarsal fracture but Yoro grew in confidence during the run-in and is an established starter in the back three. An encouraging first year. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Had a sloppy first half of the season but found form in January with some big goals and big moments. Then his season was over in February due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. 5",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "Started 12 games in his least-involved season. Outstayed his welcome after United ill-advisedly triggered the one-year extension in his contract and United have paid millions to service Lindelof. 3",
      "Jonny Evans",
      "Barely qualifies as he started six games and made one substitute appearance in the final five months of the campaign. Was excellent in the goalless draw with Aston Villa. 4",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Amorim turned to him in the final month and that faith was misguided. Shaw missed seven months of football and was shoddy in the Europa League final. 3",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "The mid-season arrival had an enterprising few weeks in March and April but he suffered from Dalot's injury and failed to have any impact in United's remaining matches, despite starting regularly. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Had a handful of decent games and scored a couple of good goals but, for a 24-year-old, he has seldom looked ready to anchor United's midfield. His form was so poor in recent weeks he was benched for the Europa League final. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Went from redundant to relevant in the Europa League knockout stage, when he was totemic. That skews the perception of Casemiro, who had a forgettable domestic term. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Another injury-prone season was almost salvaged with a few goals and a start in the Europa League final. Then Mount reminded everyone in Bilbao why he and United have always looked a mismatch. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Lost his starting place a long time ago. He will always have the Lyon equaliser from his second full campaign but this has been one to forget for a player whose future is uncertain. 4",
      "Christian Eriksen",
      "Started 19 games in a season that was destined to be his last at United. Eriksen scored five goals but his only one in the league was the final-day penalty against Villa. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "The turning point for Fernandes was his red card at Wolves on Boxing Day. Before then, he looked like another United player who had eased up after signing a new contract. In 2025, he has been such a driving force that comparisons with Bryan Robson are legitimate. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Might have been United's player of the season but for his two-and-a-half-month lay-off between February and May. Tallied 11 goals and came up with memorable moments against Manchester City and Southampton. 8",

      "Has become a borderline cult hero since his 33rd-minute withdrawal against Newcastle. Zirkzee rallied in 2025 and produced good performances in a more withdrawn role. But he is not a striker. 5",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Not got anywhere near the highs of 2023-24 in a season of personal lows. Garnacho has done decently for a 20-year-old adapting to a new system but he has often been juvenile and crossed his head coach one too many times. 6",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "After his matchwinning goals in Plzen on December 12, Hojlund scraped three goals in 35 matches. Hojlund scored 10 goals and only four of them were in the Premier League. Drained of confidence and not good enough. 3",
      "Players must have started at least five games to be eligible for a rating. Loanees are excluded."

      "Bruno Fernandes might have dropped a hint on his Manchester United future by gifting a penalty to Christian Eriksen on Sunday.",
      "Fernandes is the designated penalty taker at United, but he decided to hand the ball to Eriksen when United were awarded a late spot-kick against Aston Villa at Old Trafford.",
      "United had a 1-0 advantage with three minutes remaining when the penalty was won, and Eriksen was given the spot-kick to allow him the opportunity to end his final United appearance at Old Trafford in style.",
      "The 33-year-old calmly converted to wrap up the victory and thanked Fernandes for the gesture.",
      "Eriksen added: \"On the pitch, Bruno was asking if I was going to take the penalty. I said no and that I'll give it to Jonny [Evans]. But Jonny didn't want to take it. It was a nice gesture. Bruno is the number one and he decides. And luckily he gave it to me today. It was a good way to see it off.\"",
      "Fernandes looked crestfallen as he collected his runners-up medal after the Europa League final, and he spoke honestly about his future to journalists in the mixed zone after the game.",
      "After full-time, Fernandes led the lap of honour at Old Trafford and was joined by his family.",
      "Fernandes has been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia in the summer. United sources recently insisted they had no plans to sell Fernandes, but a huge offer from Al-Hilal might be difficult to turn down.",

      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Fernandes is under contract at United until 2027, with the club holding the option of an additional year."

      "The Dutchman's last game in charge of United was a 2-1 defeat to West Ham on October 27.",
      "Ten Hag has been out of work since his departure from Old Trafford, but he has now taken his next job with Bayer Leverkusen, who have appointed him on a two-year contract.",
      "Leverkusen confirmed the appointment on Monday morning, and Ten Hag said: \"Bayer 04 are one of the best clubs in Germany and also among the top clubs in Europe. The club offers outstanding conditions, I've been very impressed with the discussions of the management.",
      "\"I've come to Leverkusen to continue with the ambition shown in recent years. It's an attractive challenge to set up something together in this period of change and develop an ambitious team.\"",
      "Leverkusen's sporting managing director, Simon Rolfes, said: \"With Erik ten Hag we have brought in an experienced coach with impressive success on the pitch. His six title wins at Ajax were exceptional.",
      "\"With three league titles and two domestic cup wins he and Ajax dominated Dutch football from 2018 to 2022. And Erik demonstrated his quality as a coach with the ensuing success at Manchester United under difficult circumstances at times. Our ideas of football coincide.",

      "Ten Hag was succeeded by Ruud van Nistelrooy on an interim basis after his United exit. Van Nistelrooy oversaw four games and Ruben Amorim was appointed permanently in November.",
      "United extended Ten Hag's contract last summer after winning the FA Cup against Manchester City. The Dutchman oversaw 19 defeats in all competitions in 2023/2024 but the FA Cup win saw United chiefs U-turn on their decision to sack him.",
      "However, Ten Hag was sacked just months into the 2024/2025 season after failing to stop the rot.",
      "Leverkusen have appointed Ten Hag following Xabi Alonso's departure to manage Real Madrid. The German club won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and reached the Europa League final during Alonso's tenure.",

      "Since the 2001/02 season, Spanish teams have won every major European final they’ve reached – 23 in total – including all four all-Spanish deciders. The last time a La Liga side lost a European final to a non-Spanish club was in 2001, when Valencia were beaten by Bayern Munich.",

      "These six could all move this summer – three are basically confirmed, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave City. We reckon Arsenal should take a look.",

But to see people with a smile on their face and you go home and have a good feeling in the stadium, I think that’s hopefully something we’ll bring into next season and start well.”",
      "Eriksen went on to thank supporters for their backing during a tough campaign.",
      "“There’s been so many games this season where they [supporters] could have caused a lot of chaos where we’ve been disappointed with our football,” he said.",

Obviously, at home has been, even in the stadium, there’s been games where it’s been not good enough, but they’ve really been supportive and away especially they’ve been even more on their toes and even in the worst times.",

      "“I mean, they’ve taken really good care of me and my family, so in that sense I’ve had three very, very good years. Obviously it’s been a lot of ups and downs in football, but I think in general I’ve had a special time.”",
      "On what comes next, the 32-year-old added: “First of all there’s a bit of a holiday and national team. Then after that we’ll see where next season starts, but at the moment there’s nothing (lined up). There’s options.”",
      "He also reflected on Utd’s struggles this season and how close things came to going even worse.",
      "“I think unfortunately there’s been a lot of lows this season with the games, and obviously the final was the missing piece. It’s football,” he said.",
      "“For me now, I think people are lucky that we are where we are, not relegated with the team with the season we’ve had, so it is also a bit of luck you have to acknowledge. Next season it has to be better, and I’m sure it will be. I’m looking forward to watching it from the sides.”",
      "Finally, Eriksen expressed confidence in the players who remain, and in what new manager Ruben Amorim can bring.",
      "“I think you’ve seen progress – of course the results haven’t really shown that. 100 per cent they haven’t shown that,” he said.",
      "“I think the football we came from Ten Hag to this is obviously going to take time to adapt, and obviously it’s been far below the standard of the club and the players here.",
      "“I think the players individually are very, very good players, and they should never be where we are in the table. It’s up to them to turn it around but, yeah, I’m confident they’ll be a very different team next season, I’m sure.”",

      "The Premier League season is over and that can mean only one thing: going back to our pre-season predictions and laughing our heads clean off at the hilariously confident wrongness contained within.",
      "Mocking our ridiculous and frequent inaccuracies in this fashion makes us realise why you lot enjoy it so much in the comments.",
      "Anyway. Let’s crack on. Upcoming highlights include ‘Liverpool will struggle’, Ipswich to stay up ‘comfortably’, Forest to get relegated and Nuno to be the first manager out of a job. Yeah, it’s a vintage year all right – you can read the whole sorry thing in full here.",
      "Let’s get into it.",
      "",
      "As is traditional, tell me who will win the league.\nA large and at the time pretty understandable consensus for a Man City five-peat here, with plenty of chat about them doing it easily. ‘I think the gap will be bigger’ said big boss Sarah Winterburn; ’12 points to spare’ chirped Dave Tickner.",
      "There were Arsenal shouts from Matt Stead and Jason Soutar, and absolutely no Liverpool talk whatsoever. No shame in that at the time, really – the Liverpool-based shame arrives with the next question…",
      "",
      "And the rest of the top four, in order. Which nobody ever gets right.\nIn keeping with tradition, absolutely nobody got this right. But boy did some get it wrong.",
      "The points in this round go to John Nicholson for at least managing to Eric Morecambe his way to the right four clubs, if not necessarily in the right order, following up his City title prediction with: ‘Arsenal, a long way behind. Chelsea, despite being a joke. Liverpool, despite losing a manager.’",
      "Tickner and Jason Soutar got all their four into the Champions League at least having named Newcastle among their picks and – crucially – not left out Liverpool. Bonus points here for Soutar also saying Villa wouldn’t be as good and that Spurs would prioritise cup competitions. And how.",
      "Who did leave out Liverpool? Pelt Ian Watson with rotten fruit for not only having Liverpool outside his top four but Manchester United inside it, pre-empting his own fate by following that shout with ‘Why do I do it?’ Good question, Watto. A very good question.",
      "The standout answer here, and perhaps ever, surely belongs to Will Ford for his deeply prophetic ‘Liverpool will struggle’, a line destined for infamy and only partially redeemed by the immediately following ‘Man Utd will be worse’. Tottenham in third also didn’t quite pan out.",
      "Dishonourable mentions too for Winterburn for having United in there, and Stead for having Tottenham.",
      "Lewis Oldham also went for Tottenham, while saying ‘Arne Slot-ball will bring Liverpool closer to Arsenal’ which was so right it ended up being wrong but then adding that Arsenal would win a trophy, which was so wrong it remained wrong.",
      "",
      "Three picks for relegation please.\nObvious answer is obvious, but plenty eschewed that obviousness so give Winterburn, Stead and a partially redeemed Ford their flowers for refusing to make this more complicated than it needed to be. ‘Sometimes you can try and be too clever’ were Winty’s words of wisdom when selecting the three who’d come up to go back down, and that was advice almost all of her charges went on to cheerfully ignore.",
      "A genuinely hilarious number of those too-clever idiots opted for Forest here, with Tickner, Watson and Oldham all stumbling into that particular trap along with Nicholson who declared ‘Predictability rules again’ as he did so. This season really has been a mad one.",
      "Still, even those who got it hilariously wrong did all manage to send at least two of the promoted clubs straight back down, and Soutar is surely grateful for the even wronger answers elsewhere that allow his punt on Brentford to slip by almost unnoticed.",
      "",
      "Which club will be a pleasant surprise?\nThe age-old problem with this question is not just identifying things that are surprises but also things that are pleasant.",
      "Winty’s shout for Everton to be ‘serenely… in mid-table’ turned out right in the end and the Moyes return just about ticks the pleasant box, we’d suggest.",
      "Stead does well here:",
      "Chelsea will do well, but while that will surprise some it will not be in any way pleasant. If Brentford can avoid half their squad being unavailable this time they should get back to their nose-bloodying best.",
      "Ford continues his redemption arc from the Liverpool unpleasantness by suggesting ‘Bournemouth will be in the mix for Europe before Andoni Iraola has his head turned by one of the big boys.’ Iraola may not have left, but only time will tell if there was nevertheless some head-turning involved in the way they fell off in spring.",
      "Tickner starts off okay with a Palace 50-point shout but then goes all kinds of wrong by mentioning West Ham. Although with his Spurs proclivities perhaps West Ham being sh*tbone awful was his idea of a pleasant surprise. Who knows what he’s thinking half the time, honestly.",
      "‘No alarms, no surprises. Everything will be as you imagine,’ said Nicholson, who knew even then that Man United and Spurs were heading for the bottom six.",
      "A couple of Ipswich shouts from Watson and Oldham here, with Lewis declaring the Tractor Boys would be ‘cushty between 11th and 14th’. The highest position in which they ended any matchday this season was 15th after six games. ‘Everton will be in a similar spot as they enjoy a decent final year at Goodison’ is much more like it, with the Toffees 13th when the music stopped.",
      "",

      "",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot?\nAll the credit in the world here to Soutar. In a world of ‘Haaland, next’ always be the man brave enough to say ‘Mo Salah, actually’.",
      "Delivers that truthbomb in mic-drop style as well:",
      "Erling Haaland…will not. It’s going to be Mohamed Salah.",
      "Stunning.",
      "Partial credit to Tickner for identifying Alexander Isak as ‘each-way value’ behind Erling Haaland, with Oldham also giving Newcastle’s star man the shout.",
      "",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact?\nThe correct answer here was surely Nikola Milenkovic at Forest and if it’s not him then it may well in fact be Elliot Anderson also at Forest.",
      "Anyway. Nobody said those.",
      "Winterburn and Watson were both charmed by Niclas Fullkrug. Winty reckoned he would ‘buck the West Ham striker trend’ while Watson noted ‘West Ham with an actual striker should be useful’. He scored three Premier League goals. West Ham were not useful.",
      "Nicholson went for Matthijs De Ligt, which definitely isn’t the right answer and nor was Emile Smith Rowe (Ford), Riccardo Calafiori (Tickner) or Fabio Carvalho (Oldham).",
      "‘Amario Cozier-Duberry could shine if given adequate minutes by Brighton,’ piped up Soutar. Is 713 minutes for Blackburn adequate, we wonder.",
      "",
      "And which one will turn out to be a massive flop?\nLots of Matthijs de Ligt here and that’s probably just about fair enough. Also lots of Dominic Solanke, which is a trickier one.",
      "We’re particular fascinated here by Johnny Nic’s contribution here:",
      "Solanke’s nine goals will prove what we all suspect.",
      "Solanke duly scored precisely nine Premier League goals for Spurs. Yet we feel we’re absolutely none the wiser about him in general, and he was vital in the latter stages of that Europa League run. Perhaps it really is just as straightforward as noting that trying to understand Spurs is fundamentally impossible.",
      "Further proof of that in Tickner’s answer where Solanke’s unpredictability was tied to that of a Spurs team that could ‘finish third or ninth’ because the idea of ninth representing a peak Tottenham banter effort now just looks utterly adorable, doesn’t it?",
      "Easier wins come in this round for Ford and Oldham as they pick out Joshua Zirkzee, while Watto’s pick of another nine-goal striker in Iliman Ndiaye at Everton feels neither profoundly right nor embarrassingly wrong.",
      "",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain?\nNobody picked him out in the best signing category, but big points to Stead for selecting Milenkovic here.",
      "We’re assuming neither Winterburn nor Soutar were banking on Daichi Kamada having more Premier League red cards (1) than goal involvements (0), while another shout for Carvalho – Nicholson this time – has to go down as a swing and a miss.",
      "Oldham and Tickner’s admirable and noble attempts to manifest Ryan Sessegnon success kind of almost came off in the second half of the season, while Dave was also pretty much bang on with a very safe shout about £8m for Lucas Bergvall looking ‘stupidly cheap stupidly quickly’.",
      "Ford also right about £21m for Savinho, and also about why they were able to get him for £21m. Watto played the long game with Archie Gray and is almost certainly going to get the last laugh there even at £35m.",
      "",
      "Who will be named the PFA Player of the Year?\nStill technically TBC but absolutely nobody is getting this right because absolutely nobody said Mo Salah.",
      "There’s all manner of different flavour of wrong in here. You’re always a hostage to injury fortune here, of course, and that took out Winterburn (Rodri) and Stead (Saka) early doors.",
      "Interesting that this question prompted different – and wrong, cannot stress that enough – answers from all eight of our intrepid soothsayers, with De Ligt and Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice and Kevin De Bruyne and Cole Palmer all getting nods.",
      "In a grim round for all it’s probably Tickner who emerges with what tiny fragments of credit there are to be had for saying Isak. It’s still wrong, but it definitely feels the least wrong.",
      "",
      "First manager to leave their Premier League job?\nFrom least wrong to most wrong for Tickner here as he goes for Nottingham Forest hero Nuno Espirito Santo. Whoops.",
      "He is at least not alone in his shame, with Winterburn and Oldham making the same mistake.",
      "Steady’s Marco Silva punt isn’t much better, really, and nor is Soutar’s rush to judgement on Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton.",
      "Russell Martin (Nicholson) and Steve Cooper (Watson) are much better shouts because they at least didn’t make it to the new year. But they were pipped to the sack race crown by Erik Ten Hag, as correctly and in hindsight really bloody obviously called by Ford. He really would have done quite well here if it hadn’t been for that immortal ‘Liverpool will struggle’ effort.",
      "",
      "Pick the Champions League winner.\nSix shouts for Real Madrid and one for Bayern Munich after sacking Vincent Kompany means the only person even halfway in the running for any credit at all here is Ford again, who had PSG to beat Real Madrid in the final. If only he hadn’t got cocky by giving us the runner-up as well, he’d now be sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "In five words, tell us what you are most excited about this season.\nWinterburn was undeniably right – up to you whether it’s in the way she intended or not – with ‘Liverpool under anybody but Klopp’, while the wait goes on for Watson (‘Man City before a judge’) and Ford (‘One hundred and fifteen charges’).",
      "Tickner bloody loves format discourse and in fairness couldn’t possibly have known that ‘Sh*t Champions League format discourse’ would ultimately be overtaken by ‘Should Europa League winners really get a Champions League place if they are actually very sh*t discourse’.",
      "But that’s more than five words, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "The Saudi Pro League will be back with a bang in the summer transfer window and Arsenal, Liverpool and Bruno Fernandes could be impacted.",
      "Only that iconic Liverpool front three have scored more Premier League goals against the Big Six than Luis Diaz, which feels quite mad.",
      "According to reports, Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis ‘erupted’ in a second clash with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo at the weekend.",
      "‘Scandalous from that Forest owner,’ said Gary Neville, but both owner and manager have downplayed the dressing-down.",
      "Will Mikel Arteta’s headloss remotivate Liverpool as Arsenal bid to end a troubling week by making some kind of point on yet another Big Weekend?"

      "Here are this season’s disgraces, and boy is there a lot of them.",
      "If you’re after something a bit more cheerful, the winners list is also available here.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nAnd we thought finishing 8th and winning the FA Cup last season was bad. Not sure if you’ve heard but this was their worst season in 50 years.",
      "The most remarkable thing about Manchester United at this point is just what a black hole for talent it is.  Players and managers can look very very good when they make the move, only for what was once Theatre of Dreams to become the place where careers go to sleep.",
      "Although there were some question marks, United’s summer recruitment looked good to most of us, yet they have collectively spent the whole season going backwards. The squad is full of players who made bright starts, but then got flattened out to the same level as everyone else.",
      "Remember when Kobbie Mainoo looked amazing? It was only last year. Remember being excited by Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho?",
      "Several players who have also apparently been deemed to be a big part of the problem at Old Trafford have left – whether by their own volition or because they have been exiled – and turned out to still be excellent: Antony, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay made our winners list for exactly that reason.",
      "Erik ten Hag still being in charge at the start of the season was also questionable, but he was replaced by one of European football’s hot young things in Ruben Amorim and things got worse, suggesting the Dutchman was not, in fact, the whole problem all along.",
      "United have thus become the kind of club whose precise issues are very difficult to pinpoint from the outside, other than to note there are lots of them.",
      "You could point at Liverpool two years ago and say ‘they need a new midfield’. You can point at Arsenal now and say ‘they need more quality in the final third’. For Tottenham, ‘they need more experience in the side’. For Manchester City, the opposite. Try to point at the issues at Manchester United, and you’ll run out of fingers.",
      "We’ve watched a lot of League One this season, and on more than one occasion have seen sides who just don’t look like they would score if they played until midnight. When that has happened, we find ourselves thinking ‘god, this is like watching Manchester United’ – and we’re genuinely not even trying to amuse ourselves with the comparison.",
      "This year there was no trophy at the end of it to act as any mitigation, and their showing in the Europa League final was pretty representative of how they’ve been. Throwing Harry Maguire up front to look for a goal may have worked in spectacular fashion to get them there in the first place, but it is not a strategy any serious club should be reliant on. But that’s what will happen when you have a side that looks so confused, so lacking in confidence and creativity.",
      "Even for those of us who grew up with the envious antipathy towards United that is afforded to all the best sides, it’s managed to go out the other side of being funny and is now actually quite sad.",
      "United are currently English football’s cautionary tale about how low a club can be brought if their priorities slip away into all the wrong place over time, regardless how big and rich they may be. It says a lot that even now, Amorim’s prospects are being questioned, rather than his head being stuck on a pike.",
      "It’s bad. They’re bad. And it feels like nothing other than a wholesale revolution in the way they do things is going to be enough to get them back on course.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana\nLong before you found yourself without spare fingers, though, you’d be extending one towards one player. Even within that absolute horror show, the goalkeeper has stood out as a particular liability. As spectacular as he can be at times, he’s just way too error-prone to be regarded as a top goalkeeper.",
      "Unfortunately for United, Altay Bayindir looks to be pretty much exactly the same – which we presume is the only reason Onana has been dropped and then restored and then dropped and then restored. But United can find better, and need to in the summer.",
      "",
      "Manchester City and Pep Guardiola\nYes, they’re in the losers list despite completing the famously mammoth task of winning the Community Shield. Sorry, Pep.",
      "Has death by rondo had its day? Are we now back in an age of swift, incisive, direct counter-attacking football? It’s too early to write that obituary just yet, especially after City got their act together sufficiently enough to finish third. But this season nonetheless marked the first time that Guardiola’s style has come in for really serious scrutiny beyond the aesthetic.",
      "The issues that contributed to City’s decline in the first two-thirds of the season had not gone unremarked upon beforehand. Erling Haaland looked mortal at times last season, too, while players like Kyle Walker and Kevin de Bruyne were self-evidently past their best.",
      "Still, nobody expected just how bad it was going to get. At one point in November-December, City managed one win and six points from 11 games across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "For the time being, we’re fairly content to say this could prove to be a difficult and disappointing transitional year for City, and it could have been a lot worse than finishing third despite all those issues.",
      "But even after rallying in January, thanks in part to some big spending in the transfer window, City were hammered by Arsenal and Real Madrid, beaten at home by Liverpool, lost what could have ended up being a crucial six-pointer against Nottingham Forest, dropped points to Manchester United and Southampton, and lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace.",
      "That suggests there is still more work to be done to get back to business as normal for a club that has a genuine and well-founded expectation that they’re capable of winning everything in sight.",
      "",
      "Phil Foden and, for completely opposite reasons, Jack Grealish\nWe have sympathy for both. Poor Foden spoke this week about simply being physically and mentally burnt out, to which the only appropriate response is ‘yeah, no s*** Phil, you bloody look it and all’.",
      "Over the past five years, Foden has played 286 competitive games of football for club and country, starting most of them; that’s an average of 57.2 a year, and for a side that has built its success on relentless pressure and intensity.",
      "Genuinely, it’s impressive that it took this long for Foden to have an off season. We say this without any shade intended towards the Chelsea man, but Cole Palmer took less than half as long for it to catch up to him.",
      "It does raise an interesting talking point, and before you write in, we’re not specifically ragging on Guardiola alone here: he’s far, far from the only manager to do this kind of thing.",
      "But while we agree with complaints from the likes of Guardiola about fixture congestion and the demands simply being too much, we can never quite understand why more managers don’t recognise that they have the ability to give their players a month off as and when they need it for their own longer-term good.",
      "All the while, there sits Jack Grealish, desperate to play and supremely talented, but largely left to twiddle his thumbs. You could say that when he’s played he’s not been amazing, but since the turn of the new year he’s had all of 144 Premier League minutes across seven appearances. 90 of them were against Leicester, and he scored in that game.",
      "And yet Guardiola actually wants a smaller squad next season, saying he would quit if he had such a large squad again next season because trying to manage so many players is borderline impossible. Our trophy cabinet is far smaller than Guardiola’s (Cub Scout of the Year 1997/98, you’ll never sing that), but…doesn’t it feel obvious that Foden and Grealish have entirely opposite and complementary problems that can both be solved at once?",
      "Like we say, it’s not just Guardiola by any means – we’re just using this as an example. And yes, FIFA, UEFA and the federations have a responsibility. But surely clubs and managers do too?",
      "",
      "Arsenal and Mikel Arteta\nThey have to go in losers, we’re afraid, because Arsenal were more or less the default prediction for who was going to win the league this year, and quite justifiably so.",
      "The Gunners had pushed a very very good Manchester City side close over the past two seasons, and had a side that were just coming of age as City’s was beginning to look in need of a refresh. Yet all that optimism turned out to be misplaced.",
      "For our money, Arsenal fell way short of Liverpool this season for two main reasons. In the first half of the season, their lack of discipline was appalling – and by that we don’t mean they had too many bookings and red cards, which was merely a symptom of a wider issue.",
      "What we mean is that they were much too quick to lose their heads, whether that was because of refereeing decisions they didn’t like (regardless how correct they actually may have been) or because of the scoreboard.",
      "To Arteta’s credit, he seemed to manage to sort that out…only to run into problem number two.",
      "We’ve never quite gone all the way along with the ‘they need a striker’ thing, in truth. Arsenal scored 88 and 91 goals respectively in the past two seasons, despite their centre-forward options not being deemed to be up to snuff. Liverpool won the league this season with Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez, and an out-of-position Luis Diaz as their main striking options. Other players are allowed to score goals as well, lads.",
      "Where Arsenal have suffered is in a lack of depth in the forward line as a whole. That already felt like an issue even before injuries to Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz exposed it even further. The likes of Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli are good, but feel more like they should be squad options than starters.",
      "We happily accept that if Mohamed Salah had gone down with a knee injury in October, Liverpool would have suffered in similar fashion – but not quite as badly. Diaz and Cody Gakpo both broke double figures for goals in the league this season; not a single Arsenal player managed it.",
      "",
      "Raheem Sterling and, for similar reasons, Jaden Sancho\nWe are absolutely shocked that Sterling did not turn out to be the solution to that problem for Arsenal. Shocked.",
      "We feel bad for Sterling. As we’ve expressed before, it feels a bit unfair that two different players could each have ten good years in their careers, yet if they have it at the start of their careers they get slated for their decline, whereas if they have them at the end of their careers, they get no stick for having been rubbish before and all the praise for their improvement.",
      "We shouldn’t forget that Sterling was an excellent player for a long time. The problem is that does feel quite firmly past tense now, and he may have to swallow a bit of pride as he weighs up his next move. We doubt another club of Arsenal’s profile will come knocking again this summer.",
      "And while we’re on wingers whose best years look to be behind them…Jadon Sancho was genuinely great for Borussia Dortmund and England a few years ago. Like, he’s not a Francis Jeffers or something, who was just over-hyped out of proportion and was never actually going to get to a top level. He started at a top level.",
      "If he’d been at Chelsea in either of the past two seasons, we could probably write it off as just being another bad career move. But Chelsea have actually been pretty good in spells; Sancho hasn’t. It’s a shame.",
      "",
      "Julen Lopetegui and West Ham\nThe Hammers deciding it was time to move on from David Moyes was harsh, but understandable.",
      "While evidently grateful to the Scot for delivering the Conference League trophy and overseeing a considerable improvement on getting drawn into relegation battles, they want to move on to someone with the ability to push them to the next level. Absolutely fine. We get it.",
      "What we don’t get is why they thought Julen Lopetegui would be that man. Does he just interview incredibly well or something? From Spain to Real Madrid to Wolves, we just don’t see what the enduring fascination is with him.",
      "Not that things have really got much better under Graham Potter, mind, that victory away to Arsenal aside. As with Amorim, it’s hard to judge any mid-season managerial appointment – though Moyes and Vitor Pereira did make our winners list – and we’re interested to see what West Ham have for us next season. Our hunch is they will be quite a bit better.",
      "Still, it must be unbelievably frustrating to be a West Ham fan. Never a step forward without a big step back to follow.",
      "",
      "Newly-promoted clubs, just in general\nThere’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is an absolute gulf.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "",
      "Special mention to Southampton for being especially crap\nDreadful. We’re going to miss saying ‘except against Southampton, which doesn’t count’ every single time we’re talking about another side in a dreadful run of form with one speck of green in it.",
      "",
      "Tottenham Hotspur, who are also in the winners list\nAnd this is why we need that jeopardy back.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just centring your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but as we discussed in the winners, even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "",
      "Sean Dyche\nMatt Stead and I had a complete difference of opinion about Dyche’s sacking. I felt it was a risk; yeah, they didn’t score, but wasn’t that because they were a bit crap, and so focusing on defending first and foremost was the only thing likely to keep their heads above water?",
      "No, said Steady. They’re better than Dyche gives them credit for and will do a lot better when they’re given a bit more freedom.",
      "Annoyingly, he was absolutely bang on, of course. By the end of his time at Goodison Park, Dyche was holding Everton back; the results they immediately got after Moyes’ return confirmed as much, as did the genuinely quite impressive attacking form they showed while actually improving their defensive record.",
      "We shouldn’t overlook the enormously difficult situation Dyche inherited, and there’s a case to be made that Everton may not have even been a Premier League club this season without him. But sometimes it’s just time to move on.",
      "",
      "Gary O’Neil\nOn much the same rationale as Dyche, albeit for totally different reasons. The general reporting from those closest to Wolves is that O’Neil, if anything, had too many ideas, and increasingly threw them at his squad as things kept getting worse for them until their brains scrambled.",
      "That is surely only part of it: O’Neil went on record in his final interview as manager to say he had ‘never had such a struggle to help a group cope with real basic stuff’.",
      "It’s less than 18 months ago that O’Neil was being reported as a potential candidate to replace Jurgen Klopp, but after Vitor Pereira went in and turned things around so comprehensively, he has a bit of a job on his hands now to restore his reputation.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez\nAn £85m squad option for the champions, and not a particularly convincing one at that. He’s got talent, there’s no doubt about that, but Liverpool have spent three years waiting for him to add some consistency as well. It seems unlikely he’ll get a fourth.",
      "",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and comes out well on top.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has confirmed that four players will be leaving the Emirates Stadium this summer after beating Southampton 2-1 on Sunday.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could not hide his frustrations when asked about Jack Grealish after his side’s win against Fulham on the final day.",
      "Pep Guardiola has revealed why he has left Jack Grealish out of his Manchester City squad for their final game of the 2024/25 campaign against Fulham.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers performed this season; they must have started 15 top-flight games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +5.0\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton, and made just one excellent stop v Bournemouth. A clean sheet and three saves on the final day at Fulham helped him claim the unofficial best goalkeeper award.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) Alisson (Liverpool): +3.7\nRemarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2. Alisson vs Giorgi Mamardashvili next season will be interesting.",
      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +3.2\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final. Almost kept a clean sheet at Liverpool on the final day but could do nothing about Mohamed Salah’s deflected shot.",
      "",
      "5) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.9% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, which resulted in a shared Golden Glove with David Raya. They can get one hand each.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham Hotspur): +2.4\nSpurs have faced the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.0\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He was an excellent loan signing by the Cherries.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea. Couldn’t do anything to stop the attempts to bottle top five.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.7\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League (76.4%) but still gets pelters from pundits. A clean sheet on the final day at Nottingham Forest got Chelsea in to the Champions League.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever and decided he wanted a piece of that action.",
      "",
      "11) David Raya (Arsenal): +1.2\nHe was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Glove. Both goalkeepers conceded on the final day and shared the award with 13.",
      "",
      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final. Had nothing to do with Altay Bayindir being involved in one of the most controversial moments of the season.",
      "",
      "13) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.8\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it mattered most were supposed to have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine, but then Manchester United away happened.",
      "",
      "14) Mark Flekken (Brentford): 0.0\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United. A nice round zero feels right.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Had the worst performance of the entire Premier League season.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -2.5\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton. No goalkeeper has conceded more goals from corners this season with 10.",
      "",
      "17) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -2.6\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "18) Jose Sa (Wolves): -3.0\nIncidentally has the same PSxG minus goals allowed as his back-up, Sam Johnstone.",
      "",
      "19) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -3.2\nA poor season compared to his usual standards. Only seven goalkeepers should actually have conceded fewer goals than Leno this season.",
      "",
      "20) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -5.0\nKept a first clean sheet since February in Brighton’s win over Wolves but it has still been a very shaky season for the Dutchman. Conceding seven at Nottingham Forest earned him a 3.95 WhoScored rating – the second-worst of the season behind Muric.",
      "Plus mentions for Tottenham, West Ham, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho, and a couple of managers whose sides instantly improved after they left",

      "However, Utd want fresh competition, and Joan Garcia is among the names under consideration. The Espanyol goalkeeper has emerged as a top-level performer in La Liga, finishing the season with a league-high 146 saves and drawing interest from several Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Aston Villa.",
      "Barcelona have stepped up their interest in recent days, with Cadena SER claiming the 24-year-old has agreed personal terms with the Catalan giants. However, Fabrizio Romano reports that no deal has been reached with Espanyol, while also suggesting that ‘no decision has been made’ on Garcia’s part.",

      "A loan deal for a younger goalkeeper capable of challenging Onana, without requiring a major financial outlay, may present a more compelling option.",

      "One of the annoying things about being older, apart from death being ever closer, is that almost everything that’s said about almost everything, including football, you’ve heard said before for many years. All the hot takes by bright-eyed young things who think they’ve discovered the motherlode of wisdom, you heard 55 years ago when Sam Leitch presented Football Focus and it was called Football Preview.",
      "I say this not to pretend to be a font of knowledge but to illustrate the folly of thinking anything is wholly original.",
      "So you have to be careful not to patronise or be sneery. We were all young once and did the same thing. We’ve all been there.",
      "It does drive you crazy though when someone spells out something incredibly simple like it’s the most original thinking that you must have ever heard. This is doubly the case when they assume, wrongly, that you are a type that they’ve invented for themselves that they think defines your generation and that you must inevitably align.",
      "An example concerns Manchester United being relegated. Seen it, done it.",
      "I was 13 the last time Manchester United were relegated and though young Johnny had other pressing trouser-based concerns at that age, I remember how apocalyptic it was thought to be at the time. In fact the reality was it was all pretty painless. Next season they lost just seven games and won the second division easily by three points in front of Villa and Norwich; but what would happen now that they’re in even worse shape?",
      "The way Sky talk about relegation you’d think it was one of Dante’s seven circles of hell, at least until they want to show all their matches in next season.",
      "It’s all part of the ongoing project to establish the Premier League as an island of irresistible brilliance worth paying for.",
      "Fewer and fewer believe this, of course and they’ve had to play their last hand of cards of showing ever more games to try and shore up the creeping realisation that it’s just football and the fun doesn’t match the hyperbole and daily dance, no matter how many games they show. Imagine the hysteria which would accompany relegation this time? This is Manchester United we’re talking about, Kelly.",
      "Let’s say next season is a disaster too. It’s far from unlikely. Things are dire. Ruben Amorim is released from his waking nightmare at last  when he’s sacked in November and Malky Mackay is surprisingly appointed by Airhead Jim as an interim manager because he’s Scottish, cheap and swears like a Poundshop Sir Alex.",
      "His seasons at Ross County were thought to be a good grounding for the United role. But he’s obviously hopeless and they finish 19th on 26 points. What next?",
      "On the plus side relegation means they are now the big turd in a smaller bowl, financially dominant over everyone and at some point money must matter.",
      "We all know winning a lot, even in a lower division, is much more fun than losing a lot in a higher division. Obviously life is just better when you don’t play in the Premier League too.",
      "United get back to winning ways and storm the title. On top of that, they shed almost everyone on more than 50k a week, make a fortune selling off the failed ‘stars’ all of whom will be brilliant for someone else. They fill the squad with a mix of academy players and Championship grafters.",
      "The ridiculous bioform that is Scarecrow Jim finds out he hasn’t actually bought a biscuit business in Nice and leaves football in embarrassment, saying he is unable to associate his self-appointed undoubted brilliance with such failure. Similarly the Glazers decide second tier life is not for them and release the club from their icy death grip and let it be run by a fan’s trust. After a season out of the Premier League, they return refreshed and renewed, run on a different, less arrogant model.",
      "But on the other hand.",
      "It could all go wrong. The players are on long expensive contracts, no one will buy them and they won’t leave while they’re paid a million per month.",
      "Sponsors back out en masse, not wanting to stain their hard-earned noodle business’s reputation by being associated with a by-word for a poor brand.",
      "The academy has been denuded of funds over the years because the hollow-eyed ghoul just thought they’d buy talent in. Easy this football thing innit? And it is now rubbish and provides no new talent. Scarecrow Jim, anxious to prove he’s not actually a stupid, useless cu*t, stays on but sacks all remaining staff and saves enough to pay Bruno Fernandes’ wages for three days. Astute business. The Glazers continue to pay themselves millions in dividends, regardless, so much so that by spring 2027 the club is actually declared insolvent.",
      "So which way will it go? Relegation would likely be beneficial, as long as it alters the ownership and executive model and they are able to stop paying Antony’s wages.",
      "Go down and stay the same and worse will follow. It’s clear they are on a spiral of decline and that to break out of it, something radically different has to happen. With dreadful ownership, managerial performance and playing staff, it has to be imposed on them because they can’t be trusted to make a single good decision.",
      "Relegation would do that. If they don’t go down, they might be in the bottom six for a generation and be living proof of the stupidity of treating a club like a normal business and chasing money at every turn. When I was a kid Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Stoke, WBA and QPR were big, top flight clubs but haven’t been for a long time now. There’s your lesson, right there.",

      "The value of winning the game – whether it’s worth £150/£200/£220 million as Sky kept telling us – will sort Sunderland out for at least the next three seasons, in prize money and, when they inevitably get relegated, parachute payments. It also means Sheffield United have one final throw of the dice to get promoted, before they no longer receive parachute payments and have to sell assets and cut costs. With that in mind, it seems out-dated that this game is now a one-off event at a neutral ground, where inevitably the importance and pressure of the occasion narrows the quality gap proven by league position over a 46 game season.",
      "Sheffield United won 92 points in the season – finishing on 90 with the points deduction. This points total would have seen them promoted in 24 of the last 30 years of the First Division/Championship, and only the anomaly of the top two getting 100 points (first time that has happened) pushed them into third.",
      "Their reward for this finish is to play the 6th place team in playoff semi-final – Bristol City – who finished closer to the relegation places than to Sheffield United. You could argue that it shouldn’t be much of a contest (and wasn’t in fairness) but that’s still two additional games to navigate, usually to a team on a high after reaching the playoffs on the last day. Look at what happened to York in the National League. Their reward in the final for finishing 14 points clear of Sunderland? They got first pick of using their home kit in the final…which is only an advantage if both teams have the same colours anyway.",
      "Now, I’m not saying we scrap the play-offs as they are great value and provide entertainment towards the end of the season, but let’s take some inspiration from the National League and start rewarding league position a bit more. One-off games, favouring home advantage, with the 3rd place team automatically in the final, and 4th place in the semi-final, both given home advantage. Yes, no Wembley – sure, kept it for League One and League Two if you want to patronise fans with a ‘big day out’ but unless you’re a London or surrounding area-based team, it’s expensive for fans an often a nightmare logistically.",

      "2. And that’s because even a point looked to be enough for Villa to get themselves back into a tournament they played such a fine part in this season.",
      "And were it not for that officiating error they would surely have got it against so bereft a United side.",
      "Yet just minutes after Villa were robbed they neglected to mark Amad Diallo as he headed home United’s first Premier League goal at Old Trafford since Bruno Fernandes gave them the lead on the stroke of half-time against Arsenal in early March.",
      "A late Christian Eriksen penalty wrapped up the points for United, who had been the better side when Aston Villa still had 11 players and had utterly dominated – albeit with a very familiar absence of cutting edge – once the visitors were down to 10.",
      "Villa’s fury at the refereeing blunder that has cost them is righteous, but honest self-reflection will also inevitably lead them to examine their own individual errors and more general lack of verve in such a massive game.",
      "After a quarter-final exit in the Champions League and semi-final exit in the FA Cup, it has been a nearly season for Villa. Not a failure, yet not quite a success. And that’s a feeling exacerbated by the likes of Palace, Newcastle and Spurs shedding the ‘nearly not quite almost’ tags they’ve carried for decades.",
      "",
      "3. A word on the biggest individual error. Yet another rare blunder from Emi Martinez, the former Best Goalkeeper In The World who has endured a torrid season.",
      "He saved the worst for last with a ludicrous red card at Old Trafford. While Matty Cash’s underhit backpass did him absolutely no favours the keeper’s response was a complete brainfade.",
      "Even if we stop to ignore the sheer guileless obviousness of the most clear-cut attempt to deny an obvious goalscoring opportunity with not even a hint of regard for the ball, we cannot overlook the fact that this brazen foul and its inevitable outcome was committed on Rasmus Bloody Hojlund in a position where there was still a great deal of work left to turn opportunity into goal.",
      "If ever there were a striker against whom this kind of reckless desperation was unnecessary, it is surely Hojlund.",
      "Even had it been the final minute of the second rather than first half it would still all have seemed a bit unnecessary.",
      "And it points to a keeper whose brain is not where it ought to be. At his best Martinez was a keeper who would back himself one-on-one with anybody. Now he suffers total panicked collapse at the sight of Rasmus Hojlund. How far he done fell.",
      "",
      "4. With Villa’s combination of self-sabotage and infuriating misfortune handing Manchester United a vaguely positive end to a season of utter misery, Newcastle were able to stumble into the Champions League for the second time in three seasons despite ending their own campaign with a 1-0 home defeat to Everton.",
      "On another day, this was a result that could have left the season with a very different feel for Newcastle. An anti-climactic ending to a campaign of such joy. As it is, a season already secure in its place as one of the most memorable in Newcastle’s history gains another burnishing flourish.",
      "The Carabao victory with its accompanying release of drought-ending emotion feels both an age ago and curiously quaint now, it having been upstaged not once but twice by Crystal Palace and Tottenham pulling off similar tricks in superior competitions, but its significance and impact on Tyneside remains quite rightly undimmed.",
      "And the fact Newcastle were able to combine the catharsis of silverware with a rock-solid league season bodes well for the future. The next step is to make a more memorable stab at the Champions League than their unfortunate 2023/24 effort.",
      "",
      "5. The one team who never appeared in any real final-day danger of missing out on the Champions League was Manchester City, predictably and dare we say boringly taking care of business at Fulham.",
      "They were, entirely obviously, the team who could least afford to miss out; the one for whom such a misstep would represent unfathomable failure.",
      "Theirs was the most straightforward of the final-day tasks and they were the first movers of the final day with a nerve-settling opener after 20 minutes in West London. It remains, though, a bare minimum achievement at the end of a thoroughly trying and challenging season, one that ended without silverware – for the first time since Pep Guardiola’s first season – and for the first time in years a sense of on-field uncertainty to match the off-field noise that continues to swirl around them.",
      "",
      "6. Just before City scored their opening goal – the first of the day of any real significance – TNT Sport saw fit to put up the first ‘As Things Stand’ table of the day showing the current state of play for the teams third through seventh during their coverage of United-Villa.",
      "Surely this breaks all known ‘As Things Stand’ convention and the speed with which City subsequently scored a heavy punishment for their failure to hold their nerve just those few minutes longer.",
      "For the avoidance of any future doubt, an ‘As Things Stand’ might be acceptable on these occasions in the very first seconds of a match as a little reminder of what’s at stake but after that can only be deployed when there has been a material change to how things stand, accompanied – in accordance with the prophecy – by the commentator declaring ‘Long way to go, of course’.",
      "We trust this will be taken on board for next season.",
      "",
      "7. The other game that mattered greedily contained two teams with something to play for in Nottingham Forest and Chelsea. With a kind of grim joy-sapping inevitability it was the seasoned Champions League heads of Chelsea that prevailed over the upstarts who had done so much to make this season memorable but had faltered down the home straight.",
      "Chris Wood has had a stunning, career-best season but will now spend much of his summer thinking about the chance he missed when the game was still goalless. Such is football, such is life.",
      "Chelsea were by the end probably just about value for their win, and probably just about deserved the top-four place it gave them across the season as a whole, one that started and finished impressively but had a massive wobble in the middle.",
      "They remain less than the sum of their parts, but we guess that’s what happens when you spend a billion quid on seemingly random parts.",
      "",
      "8. Chelsea themselves provide the obvious silver lining for Nottingham Forest. While there is no denying the transformative potential lost by failing to hold a top-five position for just a little while longer, they also need look no further than today’s opponents to see the positive spin on today’s events.",
      "Forest now find themselves in a European competition that is enormously, tantalisingly winnable. Especially for two-time champions of Europe.",
      "And that positive spin really is needed only for today’s events. The season as a whole remains a triumph. If you told Forest fans back in August they would have something significant to play for on the final day of the season, today’s scenario is not the first that would have sprung to many minds.",
      "",
      "9. And the same applies to Aston Villa. That this Tottenham and this Manchester United were able to cut such a swathe through the Europa League should give Villans plenty to get excited about when the anger and frustration of today has died down.",
      "The damage to Villa’s long-term planning from today’s failure to secure back-to-back Champions League seasons is undeniable, especially for a club that has an alarming wage bill. But after a season watching first Newcastle and then Crystal Palace and then Spurs win silverware after long, long waits there has to be at least some small part of every Villa fan’s brain relishing the far greater chance they now have to get themselves a slice of that action.",
      "And we’ll say it again: not one fan among those whose teams secured top-five finishes today looked anything like as deliriously happy about it as Spurs fans did on Wednesday, or Palace fans last Saturday, or Newcastle fans back in March. No reason at all that can’t be Villa a year from now.",
      "",
      "10. Everywhere else there was only league position or pride or banter to play for. The day’s biggest party atmosphere was found, of course, at Anfield where a fine time was had by all. Palace gave Premier League champions Liverpool a guard of honour.",
      "Liverpool gave FA Cup winners Crystal Palace a guard of honour. And Liverpool extended their generosity as hosts to handing Palace an early lead.",
      "We don’t quite share certain pundits’ anger at the way Liverpool have played out the last rites of this season after securing the title with so very long to go.",
      "With the absence of any cup football to keep them sharp, it was inevitable that focus and levels would fall slightly after so emphatically achieving their target and it doesn’t take much of a drop in standards to bring you undone in a Premier League that might not have boasted the same quality of challengers to the title winners as recent years but contained unprecedented depth once the promoted trio had been cut adrift.",
      "Still, though. Not ideal to lose all momentum quite so dramatically in the final few weeks of the season.",
      "While they’ve been hugely impressive and worthy Premier League champions this season, we still require some convincing that Liverpool are any more than that. That Slot’s Liverpool might be at the start of an era of huge Premier League success.",
      "A big summer awaits Liverpool with significant incomings and at least one very significant outgoing – one who received a far kinder reception when introduced as a substitute during today’s party atmosphere – and care must be taken not to allow the understandable fashion in which they’ve closed out this season to bleed into the next.",
      "",
      "11. One thing that will bleed into next season – and one that will bite Aston Villa on the bum too with Martinez – is Ryan Gravenberch’s three-match ban for a straight red card minutes after he was shuffled in to emergency centre-back deployment as Liverpool chased the game.",
      "Given how little really rode on today’s game, that was perhaps a risk too far from Arne Slot even if the equaliser duly arrived from Who Else But That Man Mo Salah as he firmly rubber-stamped his own long-inevitable individual honours at the end of a spectacular campaign.",
      "",
      "12. Liverpool were chasing the game because of an early Palace goal on the back of a Conor Bradley error.",
      "Fair to say that however unimportant the game might have been in the wider scheme that of all the Liverpool players to have a final-day moment like that, Bradley is perhaps the worst.",
      "We feel a bit for Bradley. He’s a player of real talent and huge promise but also one upon whom all manner of unfair hopes and expectations and baggage are now being projected.",
      "We get why Liverpool fans would love Trent Alexander-Arnold’s heir to be another homegrown academy graduate. But that is also just statistically an unlikely thing to happen. Maybe in time Bradley will prove himself worthy, but the talk that he is already some kind of ready-made replacement for the departing TAA is for the birds.",
      "",
      "13. So, Spurs. Brilliant – 10/10, no notes. We’d been very clear that we required whoever won the Europa League to finish 17th because that is so much funnier than 15th or 16th could ever hope to be, even though those are also very funny finishing positions for a Champions League qualifier.",
      "We were supremely confident in Spurs’ ability to deliver, and not just because we’d watched the parade on Friday evening and then seen how alarmingly many of those lads were in the starting XI here. Hats off to Brennan Johnson for playing all 96 minutes here after looking extremely tired and emotional by the end of Friday’s festivities. It’s great being young.",
      "No, the main reason we were supremely confident in Spurs is that we’ve also been watching them in the league all season. An early penalty for Dominic Solanke did briefly lift them as high as a profoundly unfunny 14th, but there was no need for alarm.",
      "Even without hangovers, Spurs had already once this season managed to comprehensively spaff away a half-time lead against Brighton and it had a sense of inevitability about it here from the moment a shambolically-defended corner allowed Jack Hinshelwood to equalise.",
      "When another uncleared corner led to a second Hinshelwood and Brighton goal, it was already a question of how many Spurs might concede as hangovers literal and metaphorical really kicked in. Superbly, the answer was in fact four, the last of which, in the very final minute of the season, was enough to at long last send Spurs’ gravity-defying goal difference into negative numbers for the first time in the entire season. Absolute poetry.",
      "Spurs have completed one of the funniest seasons in history and, while there was never any real scope for today to provide the funniest part of it, they could have done little more to give the season the ending it absolutely deserved.",
      "It’s hard to even imagine how any team could even begin to attempt a season more ludicrous than this one, but we also know if there’s one team that can pull it off, it is Tottenham themselves.",
      "",
      "14. After all, just like all TV shows (has anyone actually crunched the numbers on this, as an aside, because it feels like it’s surely a reach?) season three is better than season two. But as Ange Postecoglou himself pointed out, sometimes TV shows will kill off the main character.",
      "He was absolutely right to let Tottenham’s players enjoy Wednesday’s long-overdue success to its fullest, and his reasons for doing so were spot on: you have to make success like Spurs achieved in Bilbao as memorably enjoyable as you possibly can so that players are happy to, as Ange put it, climb the mountain again next time you ask them.",
      "As such it seems churlish to suggest that today’s frankly inevitable outcome – even the way the game panned out was on brand for both Tottenham and indeed drunk people with its early promise giving way to confusion and regret– might harm Postecoglou’s chances of getting that third season.",
      "It probably has, though. The sheer scale of the eventual defeat means it probably isn’t as shoulder-shruggingly irrelevant as it may first appear.",
      "Most obviously, it’s just not a one-off. It’s not even the first second-half collapse Spurs have suffered this season against Brighton. If what happened on Wednesday and Friday put some fresh doubts in the minds of Daniel Levy and the Spurs decision-makers, today might just have assuaged them.",
      "And brutal as it is, and as much as we have ourselves come round to the idea that Ange has now earned the right to fail properly here if that’s what he wants, he also can’t really have any complaints.",
      "Even allowing for the reasons Spurs completely sacked off the league campaign and the ultimate vindication of that approach, they were able to sack it off because it had already gone disastrously wrong.",
      "They have now set a record for the most defeats by any non-relegated team in a 38-game Premier League season, and finished the campaign five points closer to a historically bad bottom three than they did the top half.",
      "",
      "15. A significant win for Brighton, though, even if events elsewhere took away the last hopes that eighth place might bring with it European football.",
      "Results today falling in such a way that Brighton end up closer to the European qualifiers than any of their fellow mid-table overachievers (your Brentfords, your Bournemouths, the Fulhams of this world) might not mean a great deal but can shift the perception slightly on where they sit in the Premier League’s brave new world where Man United and Spurs can be this catastrophically bad.",
      "",
      "16. Arsenal at least managed to avoid repeating Man City’s trick of failing to beat Southampton. But only just, mind, and still find themselves confirmed as one of the Premier League’s worst ever runners-up.",
      "We still think when they buy a striker they win the league – the glibly simplistic take on this season that involves ignoring all manner of things such as Liverpool taking their foot entirely off the gas is that converting even half their draws into wins would have been enough to take the title – but for now they must accept their trophyless fate and role of punchbag as 17 years of frustration rushes out towards them from their neighbours.",
      "There’s no getting away from it at this time: whatever happens to any team in football, the joke is somehow always on Arsenal. Warra trophy."

      "‘The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore, the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.’",
      "Man Utd added to Villa’s frustrations as they went straight up the other end to break the deadlock through Amad Diallo before Christian Eriksen’s late penalty made it 2-0.",
      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein has revealed that the Villans ‘plan to make an official complaint’ to the Premier League regarding this incident, as they ‘feel a more experienced referee should have been selected to officiate a game of such magnitude.",
      "Former Premier League referee and ex-head of the PGMOL Keith Hackett claims Bramall had a “howler” with his “huge error”.",
      "“The goalkeeper does not have control of the ball it is loose and the actions of the forward are not dangerous,” Hackett told Football Insider.",
      "READ: Premier League prize money table revealed: Liverpool break record with Bournemouth biggest final-day earners",

      "Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn thinks it was an “incredible decision” and he revealed Bramall’s immediate reaction to the incident.",
      "“Tough game especially in the circumstances. I don’t think anyone in the dressing room or anyone watching the game felt we deserved to win. Manchester United deserved to win. They were the better team and were on front foot. But the decision is incredible,” McGinn said.",
      "“I think everyone wanted the correct decisions when the VAR was implemented. You watch rugby, even if the referee has awarded a try and it’s wrong, its overturned. It’s so so hard to take especially when the impact it has on us, as a club and a team, is so big. Its’ really, really tough to take and handle. I don’t think we deserved to win but if you were 1-0 up at that point and all you need is a point to get to the Champions League, it’s costly.",
      "“Moving forward, the rule has to be looked at as the correct decisions were not getting made at the end of the day. I think [referee] Thomas [Bramall] knew. It probably wasn’t fair on him at that moment either. The boys are gutted. But European football three years in a row, we need to hold onto that and see what next season brings.”",
      "When asked whether the referee acknowledged the mistake, he continued: “He didn’t really know what to say.",
      "“Because of the impact it has on us as players and our careers, the club, you are obviously angry. I think he is a young referee who has progressed very quickly. Maybe we could look at having more experienced referees. I don’t know. It’s just an incredible decision and makes today even worse than it should be.”"

      "Only three clubs are not theoretically fighting for Premier League prize money on the final day, with Liverpool breaking a Manchester City record.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2023/24, Arsenal had 31 games televised in the UK, for which they received £26.9m in facility fees. Liverpool had 29 matches and were paid £25.2m, while Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs (all 28 games) were given £24.4m each.",
      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",

      "The final day of the 2024/25 Premier League season was never likely to be a classic, considering the European places were the only thing needing to be settled, but there were a few twists and turns as teams switched positions.",
      "Man City’s vital win over AFC Bournemouth in midweek left them one step away from Champions League qualification and they got over the line, winning 2-0 at Fulham on the final day to finish third and only three points behind second-placed Arsenal.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s side were not made to sweat, but this cannot be said for the remaining four sides tussling for the other two Champions League positions.",
      "Nottingham Forest and Chelsea battled at the City Ground in an edgy shootout for Champions League qualification, with a win for either likely enough to seal a top-five spot.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this game was tight and lacked clear-cut chances, but Forest, who have somewhat run out of steam during the run-in, failed to produce one last great home performance as they came up short against Chelsea.",
      "The Blues managed the game pretty well after Levy Colwill’s goal from close range gave them a vital advantage, showing strong character to see out the match to win 1-0 and claim fourth place.",
      "READ: Premier League prize money table revealed: Liverpool break record with Bournemouth biggest final-day earners",
      "Chelsea’s win moved them to 69 points and this was enough to comfortably secure Champions League football, as Newcastle United and Aston Villa joined Forest in slipping up.",
      "Forest’s 1-0 loss ended their Champions League hopes as they finished in seventh on 65 points, while Newcastle were pretty lucky as they profited from Aston Villa’s misery at Old Trafford to fall and land on their feet.",
      "The Magpies would have expected to slip out of the Champions League spots via a 1-0 home loss to Everton, but they finished ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference.",
      "Ahead of the final day, Villa won three consecutive games to boost their Champions League hopes, but everything went wrong against Man Utd as they lost 2-0 and finished the game with ten men.",
      "Potentially in his last game for Villa, Emiliano Martinez was sent off before the break for a challenge on Rasmus Hojlund and Man Utd controversially took the lead via Amad Diallo after Unai Emery’s side harshly had a goal chalked off for Morgan Rogers’ challenge on Alkay Bayinder.",
      "Christian Eriksen netted a farewell goal from the penalty spot in the closing stages to add to Aston Villa’s misery, who will have to settle for Europa League football next season.",
      "There are potentially eight Premier League teams in Europe next season and if that is the case, Brighton will be that team after they battled back from behind to beat a hungover Spurs side 4-1 to end on 61 points.",
      "Elsewhere, Liverpool’s title celebration mood was ever-so-slightly quashed as they were held 1-1 against Crystal Palace. The champions finished the game with ten men following Ryan Gravenberch’s red card, but Mo Salah’s late leveller saw him equal the record of most goal involvements in a season with 47.",
      "Also, it was pretty appropriate that the dire bottom three all lost their final games, with Southampton losing 2-1 against Arsenal, Leicester City 2-0 against Bournemouth and Ipswich Town 3-1 against West Ham.",
      "In the other game, Wolves earned a 1-1 draw against Brentford, a game in which Bryan Mbuemo scored his 20th Premier League goal of the season. This result and Man Utd’s win sees Ruben Amorim move up to 15th, which is still embarrassing but not quite as bad as Spurs’ 17th finish, though that has admittedly been saved by their midweek Europa League triumph.",

      "Arsenal fell only three short of matching the record for most draws in a Premier League campaign and converting less than half of those into wins would have been enough to pip Liverpool. It is weird that they didn’t simply do that.",
      "It is the next step and the hope is Viktor Gyokeres can help them take it, but Arsenal will need better luck with injuries and significant improvement away at sides in the top half to cross that championship threshold.",
      "",
      "Manchester United, 2020/21 – 74 points\nThe previous time Manchester United lost a Europa League final they could at least console themselves with a second runners-up medal in the Premier League. There was also an overwhelming sense that a change of manager was needed at Old Trafford then because some things never change.",
      "“No-one will remember how the league table looked like on the 12th of January in 2021,” was how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer grossly underestimated the recollective powers of a formerly good website. Manchester United were top, three points clear of Liverpool and a further four ahead of eventual champions Manchester City.",
      "Leicester, Everton, Spurs and Southampton were in the top seven; it was a wild time.",

      "When Manchester United were crowned as the first champions of the millennium in late April, their eventual bridesmaids were not even in place yet. Liverpool were their closest contenders, with Arsenal six points behind and armed with two games in hand.",
      "The outlook was far bleaker for Arsene Wenger’s side at one stage. A 2-1 defeat to Middlesbrough in March left them fifth behind Leeds, Liverpool and Chelsea, nine points off second and what was the only other Champions League group stage qualification place, which was the style at the time.",

That is not to denigrate the ludicrous achievement of Leicester, but the inherent advantages boasted by the Big Six ordinarily prevent that glass ceiling from being broken.",
      "It required The Mourinho Year, transitional periods for both Liverpool and Manchester City, and Louis van Gaal to be stumbling through his second and final Manchester United season.",
      "That might have planted seeds and opened doors in north London but Arsenal remained painfully fragile and the opportunity came probably a year too soon for Spurs, who nevertheless put up the strongest resistance to Jamie Vardy and friends.",
      "It was Mauricio Pochettino’s side who pushed them the furthest, yet St Totteringham had his say on the final day to relegate Spurs to third place in a two-horse race, their greatest Premier League season to that point still behind one of Arsenal’s worst in years.",

      "Chelsea, 2010/11 – 71 points\n‘This season’s performances have fallen short of expectations and the club feels the time is right to make this change ahead of next season’s preparations,’ read a line in the Chelsea statement which confirmed what Carlo Ancelotti had been informed in a corridor at Goodison Park within an hour of the campaign’s climax: the Italian had been sacked.",
      "It was long held as proof of Roman Abramovich’s ruthlessness but it had been the worst season of his ownership by some distance. Chelsea had not dipped below 83 points since they had access to the Russian’s chequebook, and their only entirely trophyless campaign was the Avram Grant near-Treble in 2007/08.",
      "Ancelotti followed up a Double in his debut year with early exits in each competition, while a miserable winter cost the Blues in the Premier League. Chelsea only pipped Manchester City on goal difference after two defeats and a draw in their final three games.",

      "Arsenal, 2000/01 – 70 points\nOnly one team in Premier League history has finished runners-up in three consecutive seasons – and Arsenal have contrived to do it twice. Arteta truly is Wenger’s finest pupil.",
      "As risible as their aforementioned chase the prior season was, Arsenal were humiliated in surrendering the title to Manchester United yet again in 2000/01. Sir Alex Ferguson’s side had already occupied the summit for months with a commanding lead when they hosted their closest rivals that February, but a farcically one-sided win basically wrapped things up.",

Having named a defence of Oleg Luzhny, Gilles Grimandi, Igors Stepanovs and Ashley Cole, it is unknown quite what else the manager expected. But it was at that point Manchester United started to phone it in, recording four of their six defeats that season in the final eight matches.",

      "",
      "Newcastle, 1996/97 – 68 points\nThe lowest points total for a Premier League champion naturally facilitated the lowest points total for a Premier League runner-up. And Newcastle accrued almost a third of them during a winning run stretching across September and most of October.",
      "They were, for a while, the runaway Premier League leaders again. But their inevitable collapse was far quicker and more anti-climactic than in the prior season, with champions Manchester United top from late January onwards.",

      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"No one in the dressing room or watching felt like we deserved to win. Man Utd were the better team but the decision is incredible.",
      "\"Everyone, when VAR was implemented, wanted correct decisions. I know it is the rule but it is so hard to take, especially with the impact it has on us.",
      "\"To whistle at that point, it is hard to take. All you need is a point to get into the Champions League.\""

      "Gary Neville says Ruben Amorim must end the \"negativity spiral\" at Manchester United and \"get a grip\" of the club after a nightmare season.",
      "After that defeat, United defender Luke Shaw said: \"All of us have to question ourselves. Are we good enough to be here? Because for this club, this season it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us.\"",
      "Neville believes those comments are an alarming reflection of how the players are feeling and Amorim must swiftly move to correct the culture in the club and dressing room if he is to achieve a significant improvement next season.",
      "\"I want to point towards Luke Shaw's interview, where he talked about, 'we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and decide whether we're good enough to play for Manchester United',\" said Neville on The Overlap show It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"Luke, it's not your job to determine that. A player at Manchester United should have no control as to whether they're there or not. The manager of the football club decides whether you're good enough to play in that football team.",
      "\"When the players are starting to come out and question publicly whether they're good enough to play for the club, you know how bad it is internally there. You imagine what they're saying to each other inside.",
      "\"I have this thing about negativity spiral in my businesses, in my life. If I hear the energy-sapping negativity spiral starting to move, whereby you can feel people starting to have an influence over the others, and Luke's an experienced player now, honestly, I think you've got to wipe it out. You've got to wipe out every single player in that dressing room who doesn't believe that they've got total and utter confidence to play for that football club.",
      "\"There were some players on that pitch and some players on the bench who I think can still do a good job for Manchester United. I don't believe it's a case of get rid of them all. I think there's some talent in there. I believe that. And this idea that they don't care, I'll repeat what I've said many, many times again, never, ever think that of football players.",
      "\"Do they want to lose football matches? Do they want to be criticised on social media? The answer is no. They do care. They've worked thousands of hours to get to this position of playing for the club, but the club is eating them alive. The club is eating them alive, it's too big for them.\"",
      "Neville called on Amorim to take swift action this summer, comparing the situation to how Mikel Arteta has played a big role in the overhaul at Arsenal in recent years.",
      "\"Someone's got to get a grip of that club, and I think it has to be the manager. Ruben, you've got to get a grip of that club,\" said Neville.",
