      "Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire are developing a promising partnership at United",
      "Things got off to a pretty inauspicious start for Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez when they teamed up at Manchester United, so much so that their partnership as a pair of centre-backs was put on the back burner for three-and-a-half years.",
      "There is a certain irony that in what could be the twilight of Maguire's Old Trafford career, Michael Carrick has put them back together and watched them establish an impressive pairing that had been there all along, hiding in plain sight.",
      "Remarkably, Saturday's win against Tottenham was only the 15th time Maguire and Martinez had started together as central defenders in a back four since the Argentine joined United for £57million in the summer of 2022. Eight of those 15 games have ended with United keeping a clean sheet.",
      "There are various reasons this partnership has never had the chance to flourish. They started the first two games of the Erik ten Hag era, but were damned by association to a 2-1 defeat to Brighton and a 4-0 defeat at Brentford. Martinez was replaced at half-time in the second of those games as pundits piled in on his height, but it was Maguire who was dropped from the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Since then, Martinez has suffered a couple of serious injuries that have kept him sidelined for long periods and there was the 14-month spell when Ruben Amorim went for a back three. They only started together in eight games during the Amorim era.",
      "Maguire's return to fitness under Carrick has thrown them back together and they are playing like a pairing with years of experience. They have the right-foot and left-foot balance, the passer and the more physical centre-back, the one who loves an aerial duel and the other who relishes a ground duel. They look almost perfect together.",
      "Jaap Stam knows a fair bit about playing centre-back for United, having made 127 appearances for the club between 1998 and 2002, and he likes the way Maguire and Martinez have developed a partnership that plays to their strengths.",
      "\"But every time he played, he showed his quality and he's been very important for the team because it's not only in how he can play, but also, I think, in his personality to be a leader, to talk to the players, to guide them in a certain way.",
      "\"So he's been very important for United and together with Martinez. Martinez is more the player who wants to build up, who wants to have the ability on the ball to find that right pass into midfield or to the forwards so they can go and attack. I think it's a great partnership up till now. They've shown their ability and which is very important for United.\"",
      "United have kept as many clean sheets in four games under Carrick (two) as they did in Amorim's 21 games in charge this season and it has made winning games easier.",
      "There was no shame in conceding two at Arsenal and although there would have been frustration at seeing Fulham score twice at Old Trafford, there were shut-outs against Manchester City and Tottenham that set the basis for 2-0 wins.",
      "\"It's pleasing for sure,\" said Carrick. \"It's easier to win games without having to score so many goals every week. We do seem to be a team that can cause a lot of problems and create opportunities and score goals, so it's definitely getting the balance right.",
      "\"There are still things to improve on, it's definitely something we've focused on, trying to be better as a team collectively when we don't have the ball, but in three or four weeks, you're not going to fix everything and all of a sudden look perfect.",
      "\"I think the boys have responded really well to what we've asked them and the clean sheet [on Saturday] was important for us.\"",
      "The question now is how many more times Maguire and Martinez will play together. They look like the starting centre-backs every week at the moment, especially with Matthijs de Ligt struggling with a back injury, but Maguire is into the final few months of his United contract.",
      "He turns 33 next month and United are taking the time before deciding whether to offer an extension, which may require the player to take a pay cut from a salary of just under £200,000-a-week.",
      "His experience could also be invaluable. Casemiro will leave in the summer and this is now a young squad, so Maguire, having been around the block, could have a role to play, especially as two of the centre-backs waiting in the wings are younger in Leny Yoro (20) and Ayden Heaven (19).",
      "\"When you play with older players, it's very important,\" added Stam. \"These older players, when they have the ability, they can guide them into the right positions and how to take up certain positions so it makes it easier for the team but also for them to play.\"",
      "That might be another reason for United to consider keeping Maguire, but for now the primary motivation is his performances on the pitch and a partnership that has been a long time in the making.",

      "United play West Ham tonight.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United take on West Ham in the Premier League tonight. United are looking to record a fifth successive win in the top flight after claiming a 2-0 victory against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Michael Carrick has won each of his games in charge in his role as interim head coach so far, but West Ham are fighting for survival this season and will be tricky opponents in London.",
      "The Irons have won three of their last four games in the league. Their one defeat in that run came against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which saw West Ham surrender a two-goal lead in the second half.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Regarding the team news, Matthijs de Ligt, Mason Mount and Patrick Dorgu remain sidelined.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up:",
      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Again, there aren't many selection decisions for Carrick to make here. I certainly wouldn't be making any changes defensively and the back four that has impressed recently can go again.",
      "There will be a question mark over Casemiro, who has sometimes struggled when the games come thick and fast. The problem is that Manuel Ugarte is a significant drop-off from the Brazilian. I'd take the risk with Casemiro and hope his legs hold out before an 11-day break.",
      "One player who deserves a start is Benjamin Sesko. He has made an impact as a sub and this game looks ideal to bring him in. I would take Amad out, purely because Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked a little more threatening in front of goal.",
      "Tyrone's team",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Carrick will surely be tempted to pick another unchanged starting XI after a fourth win on the bounce, but I would make two changes to the team: Ugarte for Casemiro and Sesko for Amad.",
      "The Ugarte selection may be controversial, but Casemiro was really poor against Burnley at the beginning of January because he'd started two games in the space of four days. I'd pick the Brazilian if there was a guarantee he could perform, but his inclusion would mean another two starts in four days.",
      "Ugarte should benefit from coming into a team playing with confidence. The Sesko decision doesn't need much explaining because he deserves a start after a positive spell. Mbeumo simply can't be dropped and Amad has played more football than Cunha, so he should move to the bench.",
      "Steven's team",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "United may have a limited number of matches this season and plenty of players deserve their chance to feature, but with momentum as high as it is right now Carrick must stick with what is working best. There is a slight concern about starting Casemiro considering the tight turnaround.",
      "However, the Reds have a long break after this one due to being out of the FA Cup so the Brazilian has plenty of time to recuperate after this fixture before they take on Everton. Mbeumo remains the obvious choice at the top of the pitch.",
      "Carrick's side look better when he is leading the line. Sesko can offer a different headache for the Hammers if called upon from the bench.",
      "Jack's team",

      "Manchester United have enjoyed a brilliant start to life under Michael Carrick and after masterminding a victory over one of his ex-clubs in Tottenham on Saturday he will look to repeat the trick at West Ham tonight. The short turnaround after the win at Old Trafford opens up some questions over rotation.",
      "Keeping Kobbie Mainoo in the starting line-up seems a must if United want to continue their good form. Since his recall, he has not missed a beat and against Spurs he was brilliant linking play through the middle.",
      "There could be a temptation to bring Leny Yoro into the starting XI in place of Harry Maguire should the experienced centre-back need a rest but the preference would be to keep the back four the same.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The big debate will be whether to rest Casemiro for this fixture. United's problem is they do not have another player in their squad who can perform the defensive midfield duty better or to the same level as Casemiro. Manuel Ugarte would be the obvious replacement but the Fulham game showed how the Reds can lose control of a game without the Brazilian on the pitch.",
      "For that reason, keeping Casemiro in the starting XI is likely to be Carrick's preferred choice. The interim boss will be hoping the 33-year-old can get through this game ahead of an extended rest before facing Everton on February 23.",
      "Moving into the attack is where United could change things up. Matheus Cunha will stay on the left flank seen as though Patrick Dorgu remains unavailable.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has to start for United but could be moved on to the right wing to allow Amad a rest. This then allows Benjamin Sesko an opportunity to provide Carrick with a headache.",
      "Sesko deserves a shot at further minutes due to his impressive form since Ruben Amorim left and with a lack of fixtures between now and the end of the season, Carrick could decide tonight is the time to give him a run out from the start.",

      "Michael Carrick talks and carries himself like a Manchester United manager. He has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham since his interim appointment. Carrick has outfoxed Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta during that run, while getting the better of Marco Silva and Thomas Frank, two managers who United considered hiring in 2024.",

      "The 45-year-old has earned a reputation as one of the most articulate pundits in the business, and believes it would be a no-brainer for United to give Carrick the job if he steers the club into the Champions League.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.",
      "\"What Michael’s doing is very impressive. The fans are happy, which is important. The players are happy and that’s important, but the most important thing is that the team wins.",
      "\"United have had big-name managers on the bench. They had two of the greatest in the last 10 years, up there with Pep and Ancelotti: Van Gaal and Mourinho. A huge name comes with more expectation.\"",
      "Carrick received support from matchgoers even before his appointment was formalised. His name was sung at Turf Moor when Darren Fletcher was caretaker, and \"it's Carrick, you know, hard to believe it's not Scholes\" was aired by fans after the victory over Tottenham last weekend.",
      "United sources have insisted that nobody is getting carried away. Carrick has played down questions about his future, but Hargreaves believes he would be worthy of landing the job permanently.",
      "He said: \"I’ve known Michael for 24 years. I played with him for 21. He’s not a 'me' guy. He’ll ask, 'What’s the solution? How can I make him play better?' He’s good with people. He’ll put players in positions to succeed. He’s got Bruno, the best creator in the division. Kobbie is back in the team.",
      "\"Casemiro playing as the six. Everybody’s in a good spot. The back four is super good. Every player is playing different roles compared to before. Wing-backs are full-backs. Centre-backs went from a three to a two. Midfield two is now a three. Tens playing wide or as strikers.",
      "\"Even Bryan Mbeumo has played on the right or as a 10. To change that many players with no pre-season and still make the team function — I don’t see how you couldn’t give him the job.",
      "\"You know what it’s like when it’s not good and when everyone’s happy, and you’re winning. Why stop that just to bring in a name? If you could get Luis Enrique, obviously. But the only thing going against Carrick is experience. The most important thing is the team functions, and it is functioning well.",
      "\"Pep got an opportunity as a young coach and took it. Zidane got an opportunity and did remarkable things with Madrid. Everyone said 'young coach', but he needed an opportunity. He ran with it. If Carrick finishes third or fourth, I don’t see how you don’t follow it through.\"",
      "\"He’s been faultless. Even his subs have been great. The starting XI looks good, everyone looks settled,\" added Hargreaves. \"Michael has done a good job of finding solutions and not being rigid. I don’t understand when we got into this position where every manager says, 'This is how I play and I’m not going to change it.' Why? I never played in a game of football that looked the same. I never played in two games that looked the same.",
      "\"So why would I always have the same plan or formation? Against Tottenham, there was so much rotation. Players popped up in different positions. Bruno was rotating all over the place. Shaw was pushing high. Casemiro was dropping between the centre-backs. Players found solutions out there and weren’t wedded to one style.\"",
      "Carrick has given fans something to smile about.(Image: MI News/NurPhoto)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been at the centre of Carrick's success since his appointment. The youngster was left in the cold during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Carrick has made Mainoo integral to his plans. He has rewarded Carrick's faith in him by delivering four excellent performances.",
      "\"I’ve never seen him have a bad game. That’s mad for a young kid,\" said Hargreaves. \"He didn’t play for a year and walked into the two hardest games in the league. Kobbie’s a ball player. He’s not going to win loads of tackles but can do enough, especially with who he plays with.",
      "\"If I were a coach, I’d think: 'I’ve got this kid and a guy who’s won so many Champions Leagues. He probably needs another hand.' Imagine Kobbie in between that. Kobbie is elite in terms of being able to pass anywhere.",
      "\"I mentioned at the weekend - not comparing George Best to Kobbie - but talking about the Munich Air Disaster and the Busby Babes, and George Best coming through shortly after and winning a European trophy. This club is built on promoting academy players. Look at The Class of 92', then Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay, and now Kobbie.",
      "\"After not playing for a year, to play as he has - I don’t know many players in the world who could do that. He’s not doing loads of interviews, not too up or down. Just a great player. I’m so happy for him because he deserves it.\"",
      "Mainoo has not played for England since starting in the Euro 2024 final against Spain, but he could force himself back into the squad for the World Cup if he maintains his current form.",
      "Mainoo is back to his best.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Harry Maguire is another United player with hope of representing the Three Lions this summer. The defender has been excellent alongside Lisandro Martinez, however, Maguire will not be a United player by the World Cup if an agreement is not reached over a new contract with his current deal expiring in the summer.",
      "\"From a leadership standpoint, if you want to defend your box as they did in the first two games, which you have to because teams have gone more old school, then Harry’s one of the best at that,\" said Hargreaves.",
      "\"He’s got a partner in Martinez who can play. All the great Premier League teams started with a centre-back partnership: United with Bruce and Pallister, Vidic and Ferdinand; Chelsea with Terry and Carvalho; Arsenal with Adams, and Liverpool too. Look at Arsenal now with Gabriel and Saliba.",
      "\"It’s all built on that. Since they’ve gone to a back four, that’s perfect. One of the biggest mistakes United made when things started to go wrong in the transfer market was losing leadership.",
      "\"They lost so many leaders within a few years: Van der Sar, Gary Neville, Rio, Vidic, Evra, Scholes, Giggs, Rooney, Ronaldo. You can sign players all you like, but they lost leadership.",
      "\"You only really know players when it’s difficult. Other than Bruno, they didn’t have enough leaders. With Harry’s leadership and everything he’s been through, he can mentor younger players. I hope he stays. Credit to him for how he’s come through and kept playing well.\"",

Mount picked up a minor injury in training before the win against Fulham and remained absent when United beat Tottenham at Old Trafford on Saturday.",

The Dutch centre-back hasn't played since United won at Crystal Palace on November 30, when Ruben Amorim initially said his absence would be short-term.",

      "\"Mason will be probably not for Tuesday, probably after, but definitely going into the Everton game he'll be back,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"Matthijs, we'll see how he develops, the Everton game feels like a long time away at the moment, so we'll see how he develops, but he's positive, he's moving in the right direction, but Mason's a little bit closer than him.\"",
      "United will face a West Ham team who have just started to find some form. Although they remain in the relegation zone they have won three of their last four Premier League games and will present a different kind of test for Carrick, who is looking to continue a perfect start since being appointed head coach until the end of the season.",

      "\"The type of game, the feel of the game, what kind of skills we're going to have to try and draw on. Different games throw up different things. Teams towards the bottom of the league are really fighting for things, but so are we, and we've got a lot to fight for, so you'd like to think that balances out in some ways and it's who can come out on top at the end of it.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has played a vital role for Manchester United under Michael Carrick.",
      "Manchester United's reported consideration of loaning out Kobbie Mainoo for the rest of the season is claimed to have left several Premier League clubs, and Napoli, in disbelief. Mainoo endured a difficult first few months of the season under former head coach Ruben Amorim and was not trusted with a single Premier League start before the Portuguese's departure in December.",
      "At one stage, Mainoo looked in danger of heading out on loan, before interim head coach Michael Carrick took over. Napoli were keen to secure the 21‑year‑old on a temporary deal for the remainder of the season, while the midfielder also attracted interest from Tottenham, Aston Villa and Everton.",
      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund both moved to Napoli - McTominay permanently and Hojlund on loan - and the pair have been rejuvenated since leaving Old Trafford. Napoli boss Antonio Conte was eager to bring in another United player following their success.",
      "According to The Telegraph, there was \"genuine disbelief\" in Naples that United were even contemplating letting Mainoo go. Similar feelings were reportedly shared by \"many Premier League clubs\" who were interested in taking the youngster on loan.",
      "During Amorim's time in charge, the 41‑year‑old often spoke about wanting players to \"stay and fight\" rather than walk away at the first sign of adversity - criticising what he saw as an \"entitlement\" culture among some academy players.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MANCHESTER UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN's Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He had also highlighted Casemiro as an example of a player who shifted his mindset and fought his way back into the team, saying: \"When I see Casemiro training, if everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set-pieces training, even when they are playing ten versus goalkeeper, and the movements that he made, imagining the game, we will be a top team.",
      "\"If everyone works like Casemiro, and when I say work it's not just running, it's that focus. You can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues, because if you pay attention to everything that he does with contract, with no contract, he's top player.\"",
      "This was a message widely interpreted as another pointed reference to Mainoo.",
      "The Mirror also reported that, as a result of Carrick's arrival, Mainoo was told he would be part of the plans for the remainder of the season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has returned to the Manchester United line-up under Michael Carrick.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "That came with a clear instruction to focus on re‑establishing himself at his boyhood club, while proving Amorim had been wrong to overlook him.",
      "Under Carrick, Mainoo has started against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "He is also in contention to start their match at relegation-threatened West Ham on Tuesday evening (8pm).",

      "Sandro Tonali is reportedly on Man United's transfer radar(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)",
      "The upcoming transfer window promises to be a notable one for Manchester United. That will be the case regardless of who is in the dugout, though Michael Carrick has made a strong case for himself with four wins from his first four Premier League matches.",
      "Saturday's win over Tottenham saw United stay in the Champions League places, one point above fifth-placed Chelsea but five clear of Liverpool in sixth. Qualification for Europe's top tournament could make it easier to lure targets to Old Trafford, with Sandro Tonali's name the latest to be linked with a switch.",
      "Newcastle midfielder Tonali was linked with a deadline day move to Arsenal, though the Magpies were quick to shut down talk of an exit for the Italian. United are admirers themselves but Tonali's contract situation - his current deal runs until 2029 with an option for an extra year - means he's unlikely to be cheap.",
      "A more pertinent question is whether Tonali would be the only new midfield addition. United spent £200million on three new forwards over the summer and a similar outlay might be required for a midfield rebuild, with neither Tonali nor other potential signings likely to come cheap.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Tonali has arguably been at his best for Newcastle in a three with Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton. That, perhaps, might provide an indication of what else United would need to complement the former AC Milan star.",
      "He has the qualities to play in a two-man pivot with Bruno Fernandes in front - the approach used by United over the weekend, when Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo sat behind the Portuguese. However, the structure at St James' Park indicates he could come in handy if United receive renewed interest in Fernandes over the summer and decide to cash in on their captain.",
      "Of course, Casemiro won't be part of that midfield next term. The Brazilian is due to leave Old Trafford when his contract expires in the summer and even a recent uptick in form is unlikely to change that.",
      "Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba have both been linked with United(Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Another dip into the transfer market looks like the answer and there are some familiar names in the mix. United found themselves priced out of a move for Carlos Baleba last summer but may decide the Cameroon international is worth the premium it will take to sign him.",
      "Others in the mix include Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson. Wharton may be more likely to entertain a move in the knowledge Oliver Glasner won't be his manager at Crystal Palace next term, while the nine-figure sum quoted in recent windows has come down to something a little more affordable in recent reports.",
      "If United do find a way to partner Tonali with Nottingham Forest star Anderson, it could prove that bit more painful for Newcastle fans. The pair were team-mates at St James' Park during the 2023/24 season but played a full 90 minutes together just once - in a 2-2 draw at West Ham in October 2023.",
      "Tonali and Anderson were briefly team-mates at Newcastle(Image: MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Anderson's strength and press resistance means he arguably complements Tonali's qualities better than the other names mentioned, while a combination of the pair could also help bring the best out of Kobbie Mainoo. The main issue for the United youngster this year, namely that former boss Ruben Amorim considered it an either-or between him and Fernandes in a 3-4-3, is now no longer a factor.",
      "Additionally, if United secure European qualification, they'll need enough strength in depth to be able to rotate. A lack of cup distractions has helped avoid burnout this term and put United in a strong position to finish as high as possible but things will have to change if additional Champions League or Europa League football is part of the equation.",
      "Tonali has shown that durability this term, barely missing a game all season, though he has been able to recharge with the occasional substitute appearance rather than playing the full 90 every week. It's easy to see why United might want the 25-year-old but, out of the other contenders, Anderson looks like the best fit to join at the same time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has opened up about his injuries post football career(Image: PA)",
      "Years of playing football at the highest level for Manchester United and England have left Rio Ferdinand requiring a wheelchair. The former United defender's lengthy and distinguished career took its toll through serious injuries, and more than a decade after hanging up his boots, he still requires hospital treatment.",
      "Now aged 47, Ferdinand revealed to Men's Health UK: \"I've had a bad back for a long time. I've got injuries that I had from my career... I was on tablets and injections for six years to play games.",
      "\"That's affected me. I get some bad moments of back pain where I have to be in a hospital for a couple of days or in a wheelchair for a couple of days. It's mad, but it just comes out of nowhere.\"",
      "Ferdinand and his family have relocated to Dubai, which he describes as a fresh 'adventure,' and he's adopted new methods to better maintain his physical condition. \"I've been seeing a physio for the first time since I retired,\" he explained.",
      "\"He's been doing loads of manipulations and whatnot, and within his building there's also my personal trainer, so he feeds him information about my training. There's a holistic approach to what I'm doing now and hopefully that's going to put me in good stead.",

      "Despite winning 14 major trophies during his career, including six Premier League titles, Rio remains determined not to rest on his laurels. Staying active matters to him as he wants to set an example for his children.",
      "He said: \"I've got kids that need to see a work ethic. My kids need to see me getting up and going to work. They need to see me and [my wife] Kate going to the gym. I want them to have a healthy lifestyle and to think that going to the gym or just moving is the norm.",
      "\"And I'm not about telling my kids that; they need to see it. But also, if I'm being honest, I have to go to work for my mental sanity as well. I like work; my mum and dad worked. They were grafters. That's all I've known.",
      "Rio Ferdinand and wife Kate(Image: BBC)",
      "\"When my kids talk about me, as much as it is, yeah, 'Daddy loves me', and, 'Daddy's done everything for me.' It's, 'Daddy worked hard. He was a hustler.' You know what I mean?\"",
      "Life in Dubai with wife Kate and the family offers a stark contrast to the demands of football training back in Manchester. \"My life has been governed by the fixture list while playing football and then, post-career, being a pundit,\" he acknowledged.",
      "\"There aren't many opportunities in life where you get time to make a big change, have an adventure, step out of your comfort zone and explore something new. So this is it. This is what we wanted to do.\"",
      "\"I had it fine at TNT. I could have signed a new contract at TNT. Easily. But that ain't who I am really. It's time for something new... Because I saw the new world is that linear TV and live football are always going to be there.",
      "Rio Ferdinand during his time at TNT(Image: PA)",
      "\"But there's also another world outside the 90 minutes that intrigues me, which I look at like a fan. So I want to know what these guys are eating, how do they sleep, how do they recover? I want to get the public closer to that and I want to be at the forefront of that.\"",
      "While Rio will always be a legend to Manchester United fans for his footballing prowess, the man he has become post-football is still evolving.",
      "\"[I want to be remembered] as someone who worked hard and has been successful in multiple sectors,\" he reflected. \"Whether it's my [Rio Ferdinand] Foundation, which has been going for 15 years, helping underprivileged kids, or whether it's my [Rio Ferdinand Presents] media company or other successful businesses that I've got.",
      "\"I just want to be someone who is a doer...who ain't scared of change or failure. Who always stood up for the right things when need be. And if I can inspire other people doing that type of stuff, then it's like, 'Okay, I've done all right.'\"",

The report goes on to claim that if things don’t work out for the 21-year-old, then it is hard to see him being offered another chance in the Premier League.",
      "Garnacho’s Manchester United exit had been on the cards ever since the winger expressed frustration at starting last season’s Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on the bench. Earlier that campaign, former Reds boss Ruben Amorim also felt he was not paying attention to instructions when he was about to come on late in a Europa League tie with Viktoria Plzen.",

      "The goals came after Spurs were reduced to 10 men in the first half. Captain Cristian Romero was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Casemiro, with United able to make their numerical advantage count.",

      "Cristian Romero picked up his second red card of the season for Tottenham(Image: (Photo by James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images))",
      "Former Premier League forward Alan Shearer has supported referee Michael Oliver's decision to dismiss Cristian Romero during Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "The sending off occurred following a poorly executed tackle by the defender on Casemiro early in the match, with the referee promptly showing him the red card.",
      "This proved to be a pivotal moment in the match for both Spurs and United, as goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes led to another victory for Michael Carrick - his fourth in as many games as interim boss.",
      "While some might argue that Romero was merely running towards the ball and was unlucky to collide with Casemiro in the manner he did, Shearer is of the opinion that the right call was made, as BBC's Match of the Day aired rare footage from the referee's camera during the incident.",
      "\"Absolutely, Michael Oliver gets it absolutely right,\" stated the former England striker. \"You can't tackle like that in today's game.",
      "\"He [Romer] has got to show better leadership, and he's said what he's said in whatever post he has done on Instagram or whatever it was on, but leaders are the ones who perform for the team and make others around them better.",
      "\"Now, he's going to be missing for four games, and Tottenham just do not need that. But absolutely, it is a red card.\"",

      "The referee's camera footage provided some perspective on the incident at full speed, illustrating just how difficult it can be to make those split-second judgements. That said, it seems on this occasion Oliver made the correct decision, though that will offer little consolation to Thomas Frank.",
      "Casemiro was fortunate to avoid picking up a serious injury after the collision, but continued on to help United on towards another important victory.",
      "With four wins from four under Carrick, the team are full of confidence and pushing on towards a possible top-four finish in the Premier League, earning a route back into the Champions League.",

      "\"The first goal is normally vital to get ahead, but I think it was just encouraging the expression, the attacking play, and not so much the enjoyment where you can do what you want and it’s a playground with kind of tricks and flicks, but more playing with a purpose, but really the confidence.",
      "\"The first goal ends up coming from a really well-worked corner. There’s different ways to get that goal, but the boys pulled it off really well.",
      "\"Credit to Jonny Evans and Kaita [Hasegawa] who kind of put that together and worked with the boys over the few days of having that day. So there’s different ways you can break teams down but fortunately for us today, we managed to pull it off.\"",
      "Attention quickly turns towards Tuesday night as Man United are back in Premier League action, taking on relegation-threatened West Ham in London.",

      "Manchester United loanee Jadon Sancho has struggled at Aston Villa (Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has admitted he \"expects more\" from Jadon Sancho. The Manchester United winger moved to the Midlands club on a season-long loan during the summer.",
      "However, he has made a sluggish start to his Villa career. Sancho has found the net just once, with that goal arriving in a Europa League win against Turkish outfit Fenerbahce last month.",
      "The 25-year-old finally registered his first Premier League goal contribution at the weekend when he set up Morgan Rogers for Villa's opening goal against Bournemouth. Whilst Emery has acknowledged that he is progressing, the Spanish boss has stated that he wants to see further improvement from the United attacker.",
      "He said: \"Hopefully he is getting better and he can help us in this process like he is, getting better. I expect more from him, and because I am positive, hopefully he will give us it.\"",
      "Sancho has been away from Old Trafford for the past few seasons, with the winger having completed three separate loan moves. He returned to former club Borussia Dortmund during the second half of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sancho then joined Chelsea last term, with the Blues having agreed to a £25million obligation to buy, though the Blues paid £5m to withdraw from that arrangement.",
      "Sancho's existing United contract runs out this summer and he is yet to sign a new deal with the Reds.",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho isn't the only Villa player Emery has sent a clear message to. Brazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz returned to the team on loan from Juventus in January, despite reported interest from Chelsea.",
      "Jadon Sancho has not been a regular starter for Aston Villa(Image: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)",
      "He added: \"Douglas Luiz, Onana, Barkley, and Bogarde have a huge responsibility to replace the injured players - McGinn, Tielemans and Kamara. Those three have been here for a long time and have performed at high levels with great success. Now, Onana needs to maintain consistency and try to avoid injuries. He played a fantastic match.",
      "\"We needed him for defensive set-pieces. After a year and a half away, we need Luiz to get back into the swing of things and meet our demands.",
      "\"He improved from the first match, but there's still work to do to bring out his best. Barkley is a fantastic player who is regaining fitness.",
      "\"He's gaining confidence and will be important for us. Bogarde is always versatile and helps us. Replacing the players we had before is very important.\"",

      "After converting his first spot-kick, Palmer abandoned his trademark 'cold' celebration and instead charged towards the away end with his hands covering his ears, before blowing a kiss to the Chelsea supporters.",
      "The gesture follows claims that he was experiencing homesickness and was prepared to return to Manchester with boyhood club Manchester United.",
      "However, Palmer now seems to have dismissed those rumours. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day following the victory, he said:",
      "\"Everyone loves to chat rubbish, don't they? I don't pay too much attention to it,\" Palmer said, when asked about his celebration. \"You see things. But I feel like I've come from a strong place anyway so I don't pay attention to it.\"",

      "The 23‑year‑old struck all three goals for Chelsea in the first half at Molineux, underlining the impact he can make on a match.

      "Michael Carrick has given Manchester United a new lease of life(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may just be four matches into an interim head coaching stint with Manchester United, but he has already shown up the failures that Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim managed in their disastrous time in charge during the 2024/25 season.",
      "There was a wealth of scepticism in the air when the 44-year-old arrived at Old Trafford last month. United fans were well within their right, of course, given that he was only sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer for guiding the club to a lacklustre 10th place finish in the Championship standings in 2024/25.",
      "Meanwhile, Carrick's caretaker role with the club following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021 lasted less than a month before he was replaced by Ralf Rangnick.",
      "During his initial stint at the helm, Carrick achieved two wins and a draw from a total of three matches before he announced his shock decision to depart after a win against Arsenal and be replaced by the German - with Ten Hag taking up tenure at the end of 2021/22. What ensued next was two years of rot and questionable choices with an FA Cup trophy lift thrown in before the Dutchman was ultimately given the boot in October 2024, with Amorim left to pick up the pieces.",
      "The Portuguese tactician failed to restore any glory to the Theatre of Dreams in his first season in charge, finishing a lowly 15th in the Premier League standings and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur - albeit, mainly utilising a squad he inherited from his predecessor.",
      "Giving Amorim the benefit of the doubt, the board backed him in the summer transfer window and afforded him a full pre-season schedule to play with to fine-tune his team. And while Amorim was handed a sizeable budget to bring in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens, the 41-year-old never really managed to get the best out of his new arrivals.",
      "That's largely down to Amorim being insistent on favouring a failing 3-4-2-1 formation, utilising Amad as a wing-back when he clearly thrives in an attacking role, and dropping Bruno Fernandes deeper into the heart of the engine room alongside Casemiro, despite the skipper proving time and time again he is the club's most valuable asset in the pocket.",
      "A decision to drop Kobbie Mainoo, meanwhile, rubbed a number of fans the wrong way, especially given how fruitful the England international had been in the engine room prior to his arrival.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "And that's not to mention his public fallout with Marcus Rashford, pushing away perhaps one of the club's most talented all-time academy products, who left on a short-term deal to Aston Villa and has since gone on to thrive in a season-long loan with Barcelona when he could have been doing the business at Old Trafford instead.",
      "On the flipside, Carrick has not only managed to forge promising relationships with his squad in such a short space of time, but has also been able to do something that not Amorim nor Ten Hag, nor Solskjaer nor Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal or David Moyes could; get United back to running like the finely-tuned machine it was under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "You can see that there's an air of fresh start fever around Old Trafford at present, revamping it into a genuine Theatre of Dreams as of late compared to the one of nightmares it has been for the past 13 or so years since Fergie's retirement.",
      "That opinion is backed further by the fact that United have now eclipsed their Premier League points season tally from last season, currently sitting fourth in the standings and on the brink of European qualification with 44 points to the 42 that Amorim and Ten Hag managed in 2024/25.",
      "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United in January(Image: PA)",
      "To add further food for thought, there are still 13 matches remaining in the current campaign, meaning United could potentially bag a further 39 points by season's end, should Carrick's undefeated form continue to burn bright. Such events coming to fruition would put the Reds on a staggering total of 83 points - just one less than Liverpool achieved to win the title last time out.",
      "Let's not get carried away, with the form that Arsenal are in at present, it would take some form of divine intervention to see Mikel Arteta bottle the club's first league title in more than two decades. But if United could achieve even seven or eight wins from their remaining fixtures it should be enough to seal qualification to the Champions League.",
      "Given the collapse of relationships have been a key factor in underwhelming seasons for United as of late - from Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho's falling out with Amorim to Cristiano Ronaldo's alarming spat with Ten Hag - it's vital that Carrick is able to keep his players content going forward, win, lose or draw.",
      "If he's able to do so, the future certainly looks bright for the Wallsend-born coach, who could even be awarded permanent tenure this summer for his achievements. While there have been calls from pundits and fans alike for United to consider a more-seasoned head coach when Carrick's interim role concludes, it's hard to see past the Englishman given his form at present.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "There are all manner of different categories here. Some of these managers are sh*t, some are over-promoted, some are clearly still in what is for now nominally a Premier League job in the hope they’ll do a good job in the Championship next season, some just happened to be in the right place at the right time when the job was being dished out.",
      "And some of them are Thomas Frank, who is almost all of the above but don’t tell the UK press boys that because he is like Bambi to those lads for some reason.",
      "To be entirely clear from the outset: while some of these managers are absolutely here for being sh*t, many of these managers are very good managers doing very good jobs. They just find themselves in positions their CVs from a year ago couldn’t possibly justify.",
      "",
      "He’s had quite the managerial career already at 43. Took Luton into the Premier League, which was crazy, then took them back out of it, which was fair enough, then had them well on their way to League One (crazy again) before being removed.",
      "You kind of felt he was always coming back to the Premier League one way or another, but it did probably need more than being quite good for a few months with Middlesbrough.",
      "He got himself the cushiest Premier League gig imaginable; taking over a team already doomed to relegation that won’t get pinned on you, and a situation where you are almost guaranteed to improve things.",
      "This he has duly done by collecting six points in 14 games. Obviously appointed with next season in mind, which is fair enough but history does suggest that while it’s fair to assume he will get Wolves out of the Championship, which direction is a 50-50 chance.",

      "We all know that players exist who are too good for the Championship but nowhere near it in the Premier League, so it stands to reason it should apply to managers as well. Which could make for an interesting career, permanently either becoming a victim of your own success or rewarded for your own failure.",
      "",
      "It’s probably fair enough that consistent punching above weight at a smaller club should eventually earn a manager a crack at a big job.",
      "But it’s also fair enough that when, after just a few months, it’s clear that a) the job has overwhelmed you and you are drowning in your own nonsense and that b) the smaller club have carried on punching quite merrily without you, it’s time to agree that, sure, it was worth finding out, but find out we have and let’s bring an end to the whole thing.",
      "When it’s been eight months and that manager is actively propelling the big club towards relegation, then it is definitely time.",

He wouldn’t have learned any lessons from it either, sure, but he would have P45ed this small-timing, out-of-his-depth, anti-football-enjoying fraud into the shadow realm months ago and Spurs would now be becalmed and miserable but safe in 11th under the club-understanding interim eye of Ryan Mason.",

Even without pesky rules also thwarting plans for world domination, it would still be a struggle. So it’s desperately hard for him to achieve what Newcastle want to achieve.",
      "Howe’s bigger problem is that if all those other things just disappeared and it was possible to achieve world domination, he would no longer be the manager anyway.",

      "You can’t go around winning the league and having an entire fanbase and punditocracy declaring the dawn of a glorious new era of Liverpool dominance, drop half a billion quid on transfers only some of which you needed, and then spend the next season looking like you might not even qualify for the Champions League while pretending not being as cartoonishly dreadful as Spurs is enough.",
      "Slot’s tactics have been questionable, and he’s found it far harder to incorporate his own signings into the squad than he did simply working with what he was left by Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It was always the key question after last season. Was it, as Liverpool and their media supporters hoped and believed, the start of something new or merely the last hurrah of the Klopp era but just with a baldman at the helm.",
      "And now we know.",
      "",
      "As Thomas Frank has discovered, the big difference between big-club and small-club management is not the expectation or the pressure or the standards. It’s the attention. There is no escape and no hiding place.",

But it is nevertheless mad that another club managed to get itself in a sufficient pickle in the year of someone’s lord 2025 to hand the great man another chance at tweaking some Barclays noses and issuing gravel-throated proclamations about utter woke nonsense.",
      "",
      "Doing brilliant work once you’re in the job doesn’t mean you weren’t still lucky to get it. Carrick is the ultimate DNA appointment, whose undoubted effectiveness comes in large part due to his predecessor having whatever the opposite of club DNA is.",
      "Much of Carrick’s success has been built on righting the obvious wrongs Ruben Amorim was too stubborn to notice or correct. That’s not to knock the (for now) interim manager, but it’s increasingly clear with every passing moment that refusing to pick Kobbie Mainoo for reasons that were small and twatty should have been enough alone to have Amorim sacked and probably deemed in breach of contract for gross negligence.",
      "Carrick has done brilliantly, even if the real quiz comes if/when he’s handed the permanent job, but none of that alters the fact that United would not have looked at the former Middlesbrough manager twice were it not for his storied Old Trafford playing career.",

      "Andrews, clearly, has the right stuff and is doing a wonderful job. But the credentials with which he got that job remain staggeringly slight. Brentford deserve huge credit for the lemonade they have made from life’s lemons, but it really was a monumental gamble to entrust their Premier League survival to a man who had never managed a single game of senior football and had only even been a Premier League coach for a single season, working as Thomas Frank’s set-piece coach.",

      "Aston Villa and Liverpool are acceptable defeats, Brentford at St James’ Park less so; add that run of three losses to another one against Thomas Frank’s Tottenham and most of the remaining #HoweIn Toon fans would surely turn against a manager who undoubtedly has a difficult job in manoeuvring a shallow squad to compete on what was four fronts until last week, but is also definitely now failing to get anything close to the best out of the vast majority of his players.",
      "The tide Howe is fighting against has already swept Frank out to sea. Are there any Tottenham fans who still want him to manage their team? At some point soon they will stop feeling angry and start feeling sympathy for a man arguably the worst football club to be told ‘you’re out of your depth’ at: one that purports to be Big with neither the back catalogue of successes nor the player quality to make it so.",

      "Newcastle United are said to be ‘well-placed’ to re-sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest in the summer, but the reality is very different…",
      "Newcastle‘s recent transfer activity is proof that money can’t buy you happiness, with Eddie Howe’s side derailed by Profit & Sustainability rules and their superior Premier League rivals in recent months.",
      "Their 2025 summer transfer window was shambolic from start to finish, with the prolonged Alexander Isak setting the tone for an incredibly frustrating few months.",
      "Wantaway Isak lingered around like a bad smell until deadline day, with the Magpies risking missing out on a remarkable full XI of potential signings before overpaying to sign Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",
      "And the 2026 summer transfer window risks being equally traumatic for Newcastle, who could be left searching for a new manager and replacements for several key players.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: ‘Angry’ Howe in busy sack race while Arsenal force more rule changes",
      "Howe has commented on potentially “stepping down” as Newcastle have only won one of their last nine games, while it is looking increasingly likely that Sandro Tonali is going to leave after his agent clearly tried to get him a move in January.",
      "But former Premier League chief executive Keith Wyness foolishly thinks Newcastle are ‘well-placed to agree a deal’ to re-sign Anderson to replace Tonali in a ‘sensational twist’.",
      "“Well that’s exactly it, it’s having that succession plan ready now in terms of midfield, but you know I think that they’re actually pretty well-placed [to sign Anderson],” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "“It’d be surprising what they might have to pay to bring Elliot Anderson back having filled that gap. But again, they’re stuck in this whole vice we talked about last week of the SCR formulas and the ability to spend, despite having the richest owners in the world. It’s all been rehearsed and talked about so much, and it seems so unfair.",
      "“But yes, they’ve got to find that midfield solution now. This is why clubs don’t like players moving in January. It does give them this period now to do the research and to get some time in.",
      "“But, I think that certainly if he was to go, at the right price, I think Newcastle and Eddie Howe wouldn’t mind actually refreshing the squad and the ages in that midfield and get things moving again.",
      "“They’ve still got some work to do in that squad in Newcastle, certainly I think at both ends of the pitch and in the midfield. So I think that that would be something they need to address. But I think they’ve got to start thinking about life without Tonali for sure.”",
      "Anderson’s affiliation with Newcastle as a former academy product gives them a helping hand for a potential return, but they still have very little chance of beating Man Utd or Man City to the £100m-rated ‘Manchester-bound’ star.",
      "Last summer made it clear where the Magpies, despite their vast wealth, stand in the pecking order, as they were beaten to priority signings by Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, and Tottenham, and the events of this season mean they are no more likely to pull off coups this summer.",
      "They simply do not have the same pull as the traditional Big Six, especially without Champions League football, so Anderson will ultimately end up at Man Utd or City, while fellow £100m-rated midfielder Tonali will inevitably be lured elsewhere too after the seeds of his exit were planted in January.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League sack race: Thomas Frank favourite but Howe, Slot, Hurzeler all feel heat",

      "Elliot Anderson is undoubtedly one of the busiest central midfielders in the Premier League – but is that energy enough for Manchester United?",
      "Manchester United reportedly ‘want’ to sign two Nottingham Forest stars in a potential £147m double deal, with summer exits for these players inevitable…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have chosen their ‘first-choice’ summer signing between three potential replacements for Casemiro.",
      "Man Utd have decided on three players they want to sign in the summer transfer window as they look to ‘revamp’ their squad, according to reports.",

I’ve read conclusions, mailboxes, and Lewis Oldham’s recent piece – all rightly praising Carrick placing round pegs in round holes, but it’s much more impressive that just that. On top of deserved wins, they’ve been a quality watch too!",
      "The difference in on-the-ball style of play has been sensational. I was raised on early Wenger-era Arsenal, so I know well what entertaining football looks like, and this is it. I watch entire Utd matches a lot as most of my friends are fans. Recently I’ve enjoyed watching the calamity, but a strong and entertaining United is good for the league. Only crap part is now having to listen to your Nevilles and Ferdinands spout shite about it being Fergie’s blueprint (let the man go, lads).",
      "I mean, these fellas couldn’t knit three passes together under Amorim and were risk-averse and boring under Ten Hag. Even Ole’s counter-attacking group didn’t have the fluidity we’ve seen in the last three weeks, and relied heavily on a firing, motivated Rashford.",
      "The intensity and interchanging of Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno and Amad has opened new doors and new ideas. The incisive passing from the spine of this Utd team is clearly an instruction that brings a welcome risk-taking element that is now almost entirely absent from the City/Liverpool/Arsenal contingent who only appear to encourage creativity in the last 20 yards of the pitch. Seeing Maguire, Dalot, Casemiro (!) and Martinez play 1-2s out of the back and flick touches into the path of penetrating teammates has been brilliant.",
      "There’s an unpredictability about this group when they have the ball. Look at some of the chances they’ve created and one-touch football that’s been on show in the entire opposition half (and even their own half at times!). It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s effective. It also gets the fans on your side. Best about it though is that the players who looked so shite under previous managers are now seemingly having more fun playing with less “structure”. If this continues, don’t be surprised if the players go to the top dogs and ask for him permanently. The thought of a Nagelsmann or otherwise being appointed to input their system on a group of players absolutely flying under a trusting manager might be met with a little derision.",

      "I’ve never written in before, but I keep reading that VAR got the correct decision in the Liverpool/City game. But two things baffle me here, and this is purely on a nerdy basis. Firstly, the order of events: Szoboszlai fouls Haaland, the ref plays advantage and then Haaland fouls Szoboslai, so the goal is disallowed. Why did City then get the resulting free kick? Surely you don’t get a free hit on an opponent just because the ref has given you advantage? The second foul must be penalised, the game has continued.",
      "Also, it seems nuts, but don’t the laws of the game say Szoboszlai should have been cautioned, not sent off, because of the advantage:",
      "If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.",
      "Purely on a technical basis, it looks like the ref was wrong to allow the goal initially, VAR could only disallow the goal, and should have reviewed and prevented Szobo’s sending off, too. Then Liverpool should have had a free in the last 15 seconds, where they could’ve lumped it up-field to 10 men in the box, and dramatically cocked up a final chance to draw level.\nDave (this is what football analysis should be), Wigan",

      "I have a different view of the VAR-denied goal from yesterday’s game. While I do think I would enjoy a more physical game where referees let play continue and award ‘penalty-goals’ like Damian suggests, I think there is a simpler solution.",
      "Football should learn from the NFL, and every single decision should be relayed to the managers on the sideline via headset – the managers would get to decide if they accept the foul & free-kick/penalty/yellow card, or if they want to decline it and take the outcome of the play having continued (in this case, Guardiola would have taken a goal and Szoboszlai would have been spared a red card).",
      "Make an exception for physical endangerment fouls (referee’s judgment) and I think we avoid yesterday’s situation while appeasing manager’s more – no more complaining about the referee not playing advantage.\nGirish, AFC (Ghana would still have gotten knocked out though – sorry), Chennai",
      "",
      "I’m never slow to criticise officials and in particular the clowns when on VAR duty, but yesterdays Liverpool/City game highlighted some of the difficulties the actual laws of the game can hamper them. This is not sour grapes (it is partially) but my god that was one of the worst officiated games I’ve ever seen.",
      "Firstly, Silva’s tug on Salah’s shoulder, when is a foul not a foul? Neville says that Silva is “clever” as he doesn’t pull Salah for “too long”, or put another way, he fouls him but grets away with it. Don’t get me wrong, Liverpool players are just as guilty as any other team when it comes to this type of offence, Konate on Marmoush is less obvious but is in the realm, so just give them!, It’s the only way to (try and) cut them out. Trippiers pull on Potter was worse and yet the VAR, despite the shirt clearly being pulled, deems it “insignificant contact”!!!! To repeat my comment from a couple of weeks ago, show me the rule where it says a shirt pull is allowed and I’ll shut up about it.",
      "Guehi’s foul on Salah, correctly given outside the box but will Dias stop Salah getting a shot off, i.e. a goal scoring opportunity, he won’t, last season’s Salah scores, this season’s hits it with the outside of his foot and it goes closer to the corner flag than the goal, but it is still an opportunity.",
      "The penalty, it’s a penalty, some are claiming “but the ball is out of play”, again show me a rule that says you can wipe a player out after the ball has gone and I’ll agree, don’t give “a coming together” either, Alisson is late.",
      "Bernardo Silva, a wonderful player but is is there a more odious little shit in the game? Clearly Rodri’s cloak of invisibility has been passed to him. I was convinced he’d already been booked so was amazed to see him not sent off. His challenge on Kerkez sums up another massive flaw in the application or context of “the laws”.",
      "It’s as cynical a challenge as you will ever see, it’s not “endangering an opponent”, it’s not “reckless”, as such, a red card cannot be issued, but what it actually does is give City more than one advantage. It has broke up an attack. it wastes valuable seconds as the time to take the free kick will not be added on and it allows City to organise and set themselves for the free kick. red cards for this would again go some way to stopping them.",
      "Finally we have the biggest clusterf**k, the Cherki “goal”, how on earth is denying a goal scoring opportunity relevant when the ball goes in the net anyway, unfortunately for everyone, the laws of the game are applied correctly, almost, but the referee gives the goal, what happened to sticking with the on field decision? I’m pretty sure, but not certain, that “goals” have bee overruled and a penalty awarded, allowing the defending team an opportunity to stop a goal being scored, madness.",
      "I say almost as there was one element which was totally ignored! Haaland’s rugby tackle is a yellow card every time, Alisson is yellow carded for his challenge for the penalty yet Haaland is not, he’s not even late, he jumps on Szboszlai with no attempt to get to the ball (well he might be, but still).",
      "One commentor (btl really is filled with numpties) said that adding “the best part of quarter of an hour on”, was to give Liverpool more time, as they have conceded more “added on time” goals than anyone else, it’s hard to see how this was to their advantage.",
      "On the game itself, a draw felt like a fairer result, other than Haaland’s chance early on, Liverpool missed the “easier” chances with Ekitike’s header and Wirtz’s weak effort. I remember Semenyo blasting one high and wide and a decent shot from outside the box, but can’t recall Alissons other “saves” whereas Donnarumma’s is recalled by everyone, I know, “it’s his job” and that’s what the best keepers pull out.",

      "Surprised to see nothing here or anywhere else in regarding the foul from Reinildo on Gyokeres as he scored his second goal. Flying challenge above the knee with absolutely no hope of getting the ball. These only seem to be punished with a red if there is a big injury (like Isak’s leg break). A truly awful decision.",

The reality isn’t as entertaining – it’s more slow and subtle…like the demise of Blockbuster and Nokia who didn’t see it coming.",
      "Whilst Spurs were never top of the tree in the same way those two were, they were doing ok. Go back 10 years, they’re toe to toe with Leicester in a crazy year. The year after they’re owning Liverpool, the year after that going unbeaten at The Lane. But this is where the lack of investment starts to creep in. The cloak of fiscal responsibility means they don’t sign a player in a calendar year. When they do take their hand off the cheque book, they absolutely soil themselves – they have no idea how to spend the money they’ve hoarded – Lo Celso and Ndombele were meant to be Mane and Firmino. The rot is setting in. The painful rebuild is never faced up too.",
      "Once Poch has gone, they get into a weird few years of never committing, fluctuating between big bastard names who demand money, and patsies. The ultimate of which is the current manager. At the time of writing Brentford are 500/1 to go down, Spurs are 11/1. They’re 45 times more likely than Frank’s old club to go down. Get your head round that for a second.",
      "Kane and Son have been swapped for Tel and Randall Muani. Who weren’t bought because they were the right signings. They were bought because they were cheaper and available. In the same way George Kevin Nkoudou was available. The club has been lowballing itself despite the opportunity being there for the taking, for the last 10 years. The rot is here. Not in a David Ridsdale all fur coat and no knickers way – in a horrible, slow way that’s disenfranchised everyone. From Romero through to all of us who sell their season ticket on 15 times.",

      "Having cantered to the Premier League in bizarrely unchallenged fashion last season, Liverpool seemed all set to make a right go of defending their title after signing everyone they could get their hands on (although maybe some defenders would have been an idea) and then winning all of their first five games.",
      "Since then, though, they have won only six games of 20 as a five-point lead at the top of the table has become an 17-point deficit. Arsenal have zoomed beyond them, but so too have four other teams.",
      "Long way to go, of course, but it inevitably sets the mind a-thinking about a) other rubbish Premier League title defences and thus b) whether or not there are enough of them for us to scrape together a vaguely justifiable 10.",
      "Fair warning, the answer to b) is probably ‘No, there is not’ even with last year’s City shenanigans to help us on our way. The top half of this list has some undeniable doozies, but we’ve had to be slightly dickish about teams who finished second before we get to that good stuff. Sorry about that. Sure you understand.",
      "",
      "Is it fair to include this purely because they didn’t manage to go unbeaten for a second successive season? Yes, it is.",
      "You can’t go around calling yourselves The Invincibles and then lose five league games the following year, can you? Not really.",
      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s 2003/04 might have featured an eight-point drop-off but it couldn’t match the sheer shock value of 2001/02 at the time.",
      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",
      "",
      "Something astonishingly quaint now about the very idea of a local businessman rocking up with a few million quid and buying the Premier League title.",
      "Kenny Dalglish dragged Rovers over the finish line in 1995, one point ahead of Man Utd, despite losing three of their last five matches. It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",
      "So yeah, not great all round, really.",
      "",
      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",
      "",
      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "It’s been the greatest grift in football content history but it has to end now. It’s bigger than the World Cup, apparently.",
      "Former Liverpool striker Emile Heskey believes the pressure mounting on Reds boss Arne Slot will only be alleviated if he guides the club to trophy success.",
      "Arne Slot no longer has any defenders…at Liverpool or otherwise. It’s now just a matter of time before he is sacked.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has reportedly become ‘disillusioned’ at Anfield and is already planning his next move ahead of his imminent summer exit.",
      "Some are excelling in jobs they were lucky to get, others stinking the place out in jobs they are lucky to retain, and they amount to half the current Premier ...",
      "Arbeloa isn’t long for Real Madrid. Here are 12 players, managers, ex-players and ‘spies’ pushing for him to be sacked."

      "“I know his brother got in a bit of trouble for saying on the T-shirt, ‘Free Kobbie’, but he has absolutely got a point, his brother. What was he [Amorim] thinking?!”",
      "He added: “I say this [that Mainoo should sue Amorim] in jest, obviously, but I mean, come on!",
      "“It’s so, so baffling that he couldn’t see how good that young man is.",
      "“I thought to myself, ‘Has something happened? Has he got above his station?’, but he’s come back in and you think, ‘No’, and he’s exactly what he was before which was, when you think about, arguably England’s best player in the Euros.”",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and could make another change.",
      "The pressure has eased on West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and apparently just managing the occasional draw is enough to keep Spurs in utter purgatory with the mood-hoover Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – thiship bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City and yet still, as they sleepwalk towards the Championship on the back of winning two of their last 16 Premier League games, there is no real talk of his demise.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford didn’t dampen spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Nine wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 2024/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from three games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League with an eight-point lead over an unconvincing Liverpool in sixth, and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. It’s all still an astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "Completing the double over a Newcastle side that also chucked them all the money for Wissa is magnificent. That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, even more so.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 14 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge and they are clearly more upwardly mobile right now than other teams around them in the table.",
      "Almost certainly not going down, and that is almost certainly enough for Farke.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Have lost all their games since then, though. But they should still beat Derby’s infamous 11-point record – they have eight points with a guarantee of at least three more to come because they still have a game against Spurs in their locker – and after that Edwards’ primary role has always been about what happens next season rather than this.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, 2026 has seen another huge swing in Nuno’s fortunes. For neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium where the delicious prospect grows of not only securing survival for themselves but relegating Tottenham in the process.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 12 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool. The home defeat to Brentford confirms Newcastle’s slump back into mid-table and has Howe under some notable pressure ahead of what looks like a timely appointment with Dr Tottenham in a fascinating clash between Spurs’ abysmal home form and Newcastle’s abysmal away form.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "An impressive win over Newcastle eased the pressure, but that ludicrous conclusion to the Man City game puts Slot firmly back in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford gave Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy. Losing at Leeds a day before West Ham beat Burnley is not the best weekend.",
      "",
      "A big storyline this season has been teams carelessly succumbing to The Drift and slipping out the back of the big mid-table gang and into real trouble.",
      "Bournemouth have done it but turned it round. Tottenham have done it and are still in deep sh*t. Palace have done it and only begun the turnaround against newly-succumbing Brighton who are suddenly on a 12-game Premier League run where their only win was against Burnley at home.",
      "Their next four league games are against high-flying Villa, high-flying Brentford, a six-pointer against Forest, and table-toppers Arsenal. Hmm.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "It would be a kindness now for all concerned to end this misery. The astonishing thing is not that Frank is favourite, but that he is still odds-against and that, in all likelihood, someone else will actually go before a man who is currently leading Spurs to relegation.",
      "There was some promise in the early weeks of his reign, but it has been obvious for months and months now that the Dane is out of his depth in every way for this job.",
      "He’s small-timing it on the field and in his press conferences. He’s mildly diverting in those pressers, but it doesn’t seem enough for the near-unanimous cover being provided for him by the media, who are making the exact excuses for Frank, whose PPG has now dropped below that of Jacques Santini and Jaunde Ramos, that they mocked Ange Postecoglou for attempting.",
      "It was all the way back in November during the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week that Frank first really did look f*cked and it’s only been the occasional Champions League night since then when things have appeared unf*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at that time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s very familiar now; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that extended the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "And yet… no. There is still no serious talk of Frank being sacked despite two wins in 16 Premier League games and the increasing if still inexplicably ignored reality of a relegation scrap for which they appear ill-equipped.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley was good enough is damning. That got him another week, so it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season. Losing against an in-form Manchester United is also probably fine because Cristian Romero.",

      "After Man Utd’s deserved 2-0 win against 10-man Spurs, Neville has revealed INEOS’ “official position” on making Carrick their next permanent manager.",
      "“I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I’m not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what’s the position of the club,” Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Manchester United 2-0 Spurs: Frank sack, Romero sale, Carrick appointed",
      "“It’s a very difficult situation, you’ve got a massive movement now with what’s happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered. That’s only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "“I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you’re saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good.

      "“He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I’ve built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "“At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that’s fair.”",

      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 07:44, UK",
      "One of my favourite betting angles this season is centre-forwards committing fouls on centre-backs.",
      "This season's Premier League is a bruising product to watch. The data and the eye test are telling the same story in that the league has tilted back towards directness with far more emphasis on winning first contact. And when that happens, centre-forwards don't just score goals, they start giving away fouls.",
      "The result? Centre-backs are being fouled more often than the market expects.",
      "Joao Pedro has come to life under Liam Rosenior, putting in some electric performances as the central striker where he's also been making a healthy number of fouls. In six starts as the centre-forward under the new boss. he's made eight fouls. Joe Rodon is in the firing line then when it comes to fouls drawn where he is a bulky 4/1 with Sky Bet to be fouled +2 times.",
      "Everton midfielder James Garner looks a strong play to hit +2 fouls in this one at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Garner has hit this mark in 10 of his 20 starts in central midfield this season, showing he's no stranger to getting his foot in at key moments.",
      "Bournemouth's Alex Scott, meanwhile, has been a magnet for fouls, drawing 14 in his last eight appearances. The battle between Garner and Scott in the middle of the park should see the Everton man commit a couple of challenges as he tries to disrupt Scott's rhythm.",
      "Just two wins in 16 Premier League games has left Tottenham a mere six points from safety and suddenly flirting with the drop.",
      "Sky Bet aren't messing about either. Spurs are now just 10/1 to go down.",
      "If they don't find form fast and West Ham keep winning, that relegation scrap could get very real indeed. This is getting serious.",
      "Spurs are easily swerved here at 19/10 with Sky Bet too having won just one of their last 11 Premier League home matches.",
      "Meanwhile, when the chips are down Eddie Howe usually delivers a result for Newcastle and he'll be using the frustration within the home fanbase as a weapon in the hope the north London faithful turn on their team. That's why a fast start is expected which makes the half-time/full-time market for Newcastle/Newcastle at 5/2 with Sky Bet a smart way to boost the odds on an away win.",
      "One of the standout bets on the midweek card is Crysencio Summerville to have a shot on target at Evens with Sky Bet. The winger has been a thorn in Premier League defences lately, registering nine shots on target in his last six matches.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo's tactical system is clearly suiting Summerville, giving him the freedom to drift into dangerous positions and create big moments. Against a Manchester United side that has shown vulnerability out wide, expect Summerville to be buzzing for another attempt on goal.",
      "Brighton's wobbles are a great betting edge to exploit. Just one win in 12 games isn't a blip, that's a crisis - yet the markets still have them priced as a dangerous outfit. Villa, notoriously ruthless and efficient at home, are on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet for maximum points. That looks generous based on what Brighton are serving up.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's side are struggling for creativity and confidence. The end could be near for him as Brighton boss.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen played like a man with a big point to prove on his debut. It wasn't always pretty or easy on the eye but he made his presence felt in that 1-0 win Brighton. Three fouls and a yellow card in his first appearance shows a striker visibly eager to impose himself and to make a statement.",
      "Strand Larsen averages around 1.9 fouls per game in the Premier League. That's potentially almost two yellow-card-worthy moments every 90 minutes. He carries the aura of a striker playing like it's only a matter of time before he oversteps, mistimes a challenge or lashes out in frustration. Like he did at Brighton when stopping an attack with a cynical pull of the shirt.",
      "Strand Larsen is a striker - sure - but a striker who's touchy, combative and clearly wants to make a mark. The odds are gigantic at 19/2 with Sky Bet for a card.",
      "This version of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City always gives you a chance. It's a far cry from their controlled and possession-obsessed style.",
      "Fulham, meanwhile, aren't here to make up the numbers. Both teams to score have landed in 12 of their last 15 games and they've managed that feat on their last four visits to the Etihad. That's not luck, that's a proven blueprint of being able to hit City on the counter, capitalise on mistakes and play with freedom.",
      "City will score - of course they will - but Fulham are likely to join the party. Both teams to score looks a bet at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White and Wolves. Make no mistake, there's bad blood there.",
      "Every touch will be scrutinised, every run will be jeered and if he gets on the scoresheet, the emotions are going to explode.",
      "Gibbs-White isn't shy either. He's combative, fiery and at 10/1 with Sky Bet to score and pick up a card, the value is screaming. Picture the scene: a Gibbs-White goal sparks celebrations in what has become a very big game now for Forest. The shirt may come off which triggers a booking.",
      "Combine the two through the Sky Bet BuildABet function and 10/1 looks like a steal.",
      "If you want a betting market that rewards understanding football match-ups rather than predicting perfection, the \"to be fouled\" market is as good as it gets.",
      "Bookmakers price fouls largely off averages and historical data. What they struggle to fully account for is role within a specific match-up. Like a foul-heavy centre-forward playing up against a wily centre-back. That's what we have here.",
      "This isn't about Virgil van Dijk losing control or his cool. That rarely happens.",
      "It's about Van Dijk being dragged into a very specific type of duel against his opponent in Brian Bobbey, who is not a subtle centre-forward. His game is built on confrontation.",
      "Last season at Ajax he averaged 1.8 fouls per 90, which is a huge number for a striker operating in a possession-dominant side. Even more telling is the recent trend of nine fouls across his last six games where he is bullying big-name opponents. Van Dijk is 10/11 with Sky Bet to win +1 fouls.",
      "Arsenal are scoring goals at a relentless rate, conceding here and there and making life very, very hard for anyone trying to keep them quiet. That is a perfect cocktail for backing the over 2.5 goals line when the odds flirt around the Even money mark. Their last 13 games are averaging 3.4 goals per 90 minutes and 10 of those matches have gone over 2.5 goals",
      "Even without Brentford contributing, Arsenal alone could easily cover this line. They've hit three or more goals in 10 of their last 13 matches. That's ruthless attacking form from a team who know exactly how to punish mistakes.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 13:57, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Chelsea vs Leeds - 7.30pm, Tuesday",
      "Chelsea have been flat-track bullies under Liam Rosenior in the Premier League. Four wins and 11 goals have put them firmly in the Champions League race, making ground on third-placed Aston Villa and moving above Liverpool. Leeds will test their improvements.",
      "Daniel Farke's side were going down until the sides met at the start of December. Leeds switched to a back three for the first time and ended a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory full of energy at Elland Road. They have lost just twice in their 11 league games since then, moving six points above the bottom three.",
      "Chelsea had just earned a spirited 1-1 draw with 10 men against Arsenal and were being talked up as possible title contenders before Leeds ended those hopes and marked the beginning of the end for Enzo Maresca.",
      "Rosenior's arrival has not been without its issues. His tactics were questioned in their Carabao Cup exit to Arsenal and they avoided defeats to Napoli and West Ham with dramatic second-half comebacks. They cannot afford to keep giving the opposition head starts.",
      "Cole Palmer roared back into form with a hat-trick at Wolves on Sunday, but this will be a wholly different assignment against an aggressive Leeds side that thrives under the lights, winning five and drawing one of their seven evening fixtures this season.David Richardson",
      "Everton vs Bournemouth - 7.30pm, Tuesday",
      "The move to the Hill Dickinson Stadium has not yet paid off for Everton, whose European hopes have been boosted by the fifth-best away record in the Premier League, leaving them just two points behind sixth-placed Liverpool.",
      "Everton are still adjusting to their new surroundings, with just four wins at home since leaving Goodison Park, their last coming in early December, but Bournemouth have only two victories on the road.",
      "The visitors have recently eased relegation concerns with a five-game unbeaten run. They should have earned a third consecutive victory on Saturday against Aston Villa, denied by Emi Martinez's seven saves, but new signing Rayan showed more promise on his first start since signing from Vasco da Gama for £30.3m.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian, who is seen as a long-term replacement for Antoine Semenyo, followed up his assist at Wolves the week before by ghosting past Lucas Digne on the right before firing past Martinez. Bournemouth are still providing plenty of attacking threat without Semenyo and the injured Justin Kluivert and Marcus Tavernier.",
      "Everton haven't lost in five either and their late turnaround win at Fulham added to goals in the final 15 minutes against Brighton and Leeds in their previous two games. David Moyes' side are grinding out results and now they need one on home turf to really worry Liverpool and the top seven.David Richardson",
      "Tottenham vs Newcastle - 7.30pm, Tuesday",
      "Two managers under pressure. Two stretched squads. And so much on the line when a team with a wretched home record hosts visitors with away-day issues.",
      "Thomas Frank and Eddie Howe have been forced to field questions about their managerial futures amid worrying runs of results and performances from their teams and this is a game they dare not lose.",
      "Howe can at least lean on a favourable record against Frank - he's won six of their nine meetings. His points-per-game record against the Dane is Howe's best against any manager he's faced at least five times.",
      "But with just two wins out of their last 15 on the road in the Premier League, Newcastle will be just as nervy as the home side going into this one.",
      "Spurs supporters were right behind their side at Old Trafford on Saturday, despite the handicap of Cristian Romero's early red card. But, without their captain on Tuesday, it would not be a surprise to feel the atmosphere sour if Newcastle do make a positive start in the game. Tottenham fans have seen their team win just four of their last 26 at home in the league.",
      "Being sucked into a relegation battle is not out of the question for the Londoners, while European qualification is looking increasingly tricky for Newcastle. For both, a win would be precious. For both, a defeat would be devastating.Peter Smith",
      "West Ham vs Manchester United - 8.15pm, Tuesday",
      "It's two years since Manchester United last beat West Ham. Crysencio Summerville is on a five-game scoring streak. And Nuno Espirito Santo has revived the Hammers' survival hopes with three wins in four Premier League games.",
      "But the momentum Manchester United will bring to east London on Tuesday night under Michael Carrick's management would be daunting for any opponent right now.",
      "Last time in the capital, they pulled off a thrilling win at Premier League leaders Arsenal, and with four wins on the spin, former Hammers midfielder Carrick is marshalling a team filled with confidence.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been at the heart of Carrick's fast start, scoring against Spurs to reach 200 goal involvements for the club - and with 10 in his last eight Premier League away games Nuno will need a gameplan to limit him.",
      "But after beating one of his old sides on Saturday, the expectation is that Carrick will do the same to West Ham this midweek, regardless of the Hammers' recent resurgence.Peter Smith",
      "Aston Villa vs Brighton - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Home losses to Everton and Brentford have curtailed momentum and there really will be panic on the Holte End if they succumb to defeat against Brighton. Manchester United and Chelsea are catching Villa. Liverpool are not far behind.",
      "The fear is that it is not only the teams below them who are catching up with Villa but the schedule too. Emery's side could yet play 60 games this season compared to United's 40 - and are without Youri Tielemans, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara.",
      "None of that midfield trio are expected back until April and that presents a challenge for Emery to find solutions within the squad. With Leeds at home next up in the Premier League followed by Wolves away, any slip would be a major blow to their top-five hopes.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's concerns are even more immediate given the chants of, 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' during Brighton's home defeat to rivals Crystal Palace on Sunday. A result at Villa might be required.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace vs Burnley - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Some may argue that the pressure has been on all season for Scott Parker and Burnley - it's always a tough ask for promoted teams to be competitive in their first season back in the Premier League.",
      "But for a club that has often stuck with managers in difficult moments, the board's ears might begin to prickle after boos on Saturday as the Clarets lost 2-0 to relegation rivals West Ham - that is despite having 18 shots, their most in a Premier League game this season.",
      "It leaves them 11 points from safety and with no win in 16 league outings since beat bottom side Wolves on October 26. Until recently, they might have earmarked a trip to Crystal Palace as one where points could be gained.",
      "The Eagles were rarely out of the headlines in January amid a tumultuous period, but picking up their first Premier League win in nine games against rivals Brighton will give them a boost.",
      "It has taken the sting out of the tail at Selhurst Park when one wondered if a superb period of success was spectacularly unravelling before our eyes.",
      "That seems to have been halted for the time being and at home against teams near or below them, Crystal Palace have a good record.",
      "The form guide says it will be another tough Premier League match for Burnley, as Parker continues to look for ways to avoid the drop back into the Championship.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Man City vs Fulham - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Manchester City have been involved in some nonsensical games in recent weeks - the win at Liverpool and draw at Tottenham just two of them - and yet their position in the title race seems to make perfect sense.",
      "City might need something special to topple Arsenal but the prospect is yet to be rendered inconceivable. The statement at Anfield will have done as much to convince the City players themselves as it has to remind those of us who merely pass comment that the race is still open.",
      "Gary Neville believes Pep Guardiola, Erling Haaland and Gianluigi Donnarumma to be central to this rival plan. But that's too simplistic and overlooks the importance of Bernardo Silva, Rodri, as well as the returning Ruben Dias - the spine of strength. They all know how to win titles.",
      "Coupled with that is the immediate impact of January additions Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo; compelling reinforcements at this stage of the season. They both bring fresh ambition.",
      "Moving to within three points of the Gunners with victory over Fulham would ensure the scoreboard pressure mounts and Arsenal have proven to be unreliable leaders when chasers make their move to overtake in the past. City may have to leave it late again against Fulham, who have lost eight games this season after the 80th minute.",
      "It might just be enough to divert Arsenal's attention. If City wrestle enough initiative, they won't back down until they get what they want. Pep will make sure of that.Laura Hunter",
      "Nottingham Forest vs Wolves - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Every day of the weekend brought a fresh blow for Nottingham Forest. Their insipid defeat to Leeds on Friday gifted three points to a relegation rival, before West Ham won well on Saturday and Crystal Palace ended their poor run with a victory on Sunday.",
      "The upshot is that Forest risk being in the bottom three before they even take to the field against bottom club Wolves on Wednesday night and with former boss Nuno Espirito Santo having improved West Ham's fortunes, the scrutiny on Sean Dyche is increasing.",
      "Four of the last five Premier League wins for Forest have come away from home where the counter-punching style can be more effective. Dyche's style of play is yet to convince the supporters and expectation could create tension by the Trent in midweek.",
      "While Wolves' own relegation has long since felt inevitable, and they threw the game away early at home to Chelsea on Saturday, they have been in games more than one might expect of a team adrift at the bottom and that can unnerve fragile opponents.",
      "Forest's FA Cup exit means there's an 11-day break before their next fixture against Liverpool and the mood during that period will be shaped by the outcome of this game. Failing to beat Wolves would be unthinkable, and yet many fans are already dreading it.Adam Bate",
      "Sunderland vs Liverpool - 8.15pm, Wednesday",
      "Sunderland are unbeaten in all 12 of their Premier League games played at the Stadium of Light this season, a record that puts them fourth in the home form table, and is the longest run by a promoted side since 1977-78. No team wants to travel to that outpost in north-east England, least of all Liverpool, having only managed to win two of their last 10 on the road.",
      "This fixture has got the potential to make things infinitely harder for Arne Slot after a troubling weekend. Things could go from bad to worse with no right-back to speak of (after stand-in Dominik Szoboszlai was sent off in defeat to Manchester City) and a crisis of confidence that just won't shake. Liverpool have conceded 21 goals away from Anfield this term - more than bottom side Wolves (20).",
      "But the desperation to keep up with their rivals in the top-four race might just be enough for Liverpool to rediscover some spark. Slot's side still boast some of the best attacking numbers in the league, and the Reds boss will be equally aware of the position they will find themselves in if they don't win. The gap to the European spots is already four. It can ill-afford to get any larger.Laura Hunter",
      "Brentford vs Arsenal - 8pm, Thursday",
      "Arsenal seem to be running away with the Premier League title, while Brentford are up to seventh after their first win away at Newcastle since 1934. The Gunners are top of the form table over the last 10 matches (W7 D2 L1) and the Bees are just behind (W6 D2 L2).",
      "Brentford's home form remains - as it has done for several years - among the best in the division, but Arsenal's away form is the best, bar none. If those stats aren't enough to whet the appetite, this is a battle between two set-piece specialists.",
      "Brentford - led by their former set-piece coach Keith Andrews - piqued interest with their success from long throws, so much so that, in October, Erling Haaland said playing them \"reminded me a bit of Stoke City with [Rory] Delap\". Michael Kayode and Mathias Jensen are the men tasked with delivering the monstrous deliveries that have been the source of three goals so far - the joint-second most in the division.",
      "In all, they have scored 11 goals from set-pieces and conceded nine, making them one of only eight teams yet to enter double figures in that regard.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side, on the other hand, are in a league of their own. Twenty of their 49 league goals have come from set-pieces (40.8 per cent), with 14 of those scored from corners. Both totals are unmatched in the Premier League this season. They have also only conceded five of 17 so far in that manner, which is also the least in the Premier League.",
      "If this game is to be decided by fine margins, few fixtures are better equipped to deliver.Dan Long",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 07:22, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 07:02, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",
