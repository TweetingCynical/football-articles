      "Former Manchester United star Sir David Beckham has lifted the lid on a major life decision, admitting that it led his wife, Victoria, to \"burst out crying\".",
      "Over the years, Sir David has cemented his position as one of the biggest footballing talents the country has ever produced, but he has now revealed how Victoria wasn't best pleased after he made a major move following the end of his playing career.",
      "Looking back to when he first broke the news to Victoria that he was planning to restore derelict barns into a new family home, he told Country Life magazine: \"To begin with, Victoria wasn't over the moon about it, as we'd only just done up our house in Holland Park, so how I feel about the countryside started earlier than it did with my family.\"",
      "However, as plans went ahead to convert the dilapidated Oxfordshire barns, the former England international recalled the desperate rush to put the finishing touches on their new home before his wife and kids saw it for the first time: \"I can still remember the morning when Victoria and the children were all due to arrive to see the refurbished barns for the first time. It was still a complete mess.\"",
      "And, despite Victoria's initial concerns about moving into the new property, he revealed how Victoria broke down in tears, as she finally stepped foot in the property: \"Then I waited at the front door with a glass of wine for Victoria to arrive. And, the moment she walked in, she burst out crying because she couldn’t believe how perfect it was.\"",
      "Besides his newly renovated Oxfordshire barns, Sir David and Victoria have also raised their family of six at their stunning Grade II-listed Holland Park mansion, a property in Miami, as well as a penthouse in Miami's One Thousand Museum building.",
      "Away from sharing an insight into his family life, David is best known for his playing days where he managed to stack up over 250 appearances for Manchester United, as well as going on to play for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "He also totted up an impressive 115 caps at international level, as well as scoring 17 goals.",
      "However, after hanging up his boots in 2013, he has shown little-sign of slowing down. In the decade since his retirement, he has worked with countless brands.",
      "The likes of Adidas, Hugo Boss and Stella Artois have featured the 50-year-old in their campaigns, meanwhile he still keeps a keen interest in football, with him co-owning Salford City Football Club and Inter Miami in the US.",
      "His other projects include being an ambassador for UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund), which saw him awarded the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum in Davos.",
      "Meanwhile, two years ago Netflix released a four-part documentary looking back over the life of the former footballer.",

      "Manchester United are facing up to the prospect of losing Casemiro to another suspension in the Premier League. The Brazil ace has been a mainstay in United's starting line-up this season, featuring in six of their first eight league matches, with his only absence being the 3-1 defeat to Brentford - due to a ban already served.",
      "Casemiro found himself in hot water after receiving two yellow cards, leading to a red card during the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea in September. Despite previous doubts about his ability to still perform at the highest level, manager Ruben Amorim has chosen to pair the 33-year-old with Bruno Fernandes in midfield this term.",
      "However, with a packed fixture list ahead for the Red Devils, they could be left ruing the loss of their seasoned midfielder for a match. According to Premier League regulations, a player will serve a one-match ban if they accumulate five yellow cards within the first 19 games of the season - and that is still some way off right now.",
      "Alarmingly, despite only playing seven matches, Casemiro has already been shown five cards this campaign; three of which count as bookings because the other two led to his dismissal. He was cautioned in the first half of the 1-1 stalemate at Fulham and then saw two yellows in the victory over Chelsea.",
      "After serving his initial one-match suspension, the 80-cap Brazil international found himself in the referee's book in consecutive matches against Sunderland and Liverpool, meaning just two more warnings will result in him sitting out another match. If Casemiro receives a booking in Saturday's fixture against Brighton and the subsequent one at Nottingham Forest, he'll be ruled out of the crucial journey to Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November.",
      "After 19 matches, the threshold will increase to 10 yellow cards, meaning any player who accumulates that by the 32nd matchday will face a two-match ban. To date, only Everton's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has served a one-match suspension for five yellow cards.",
      "Should Casemiro accumulate two more yellow cards, Amorim will have no choice but to call upon either Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo from his midfield reserves. Previously, the Portuguese suggested that the latter is vying with Fernandes, implying that Ugarte is likely to be the first choice.",
      "It has led to Mainoo being linked with a move away from United. Reports have suggested that Napoli are keen to reunite him with Scott McTominay in Naples on loan.",
      "However, Amorim has refused to entertain any suggestion that the 10-cap England international will be allowed to leave when the January transfer window opens. \"That is normal, and I also know that in our club, everything is a lot of noise, and you have to have news, and players are not playing,\" Amorim said. \"They want to play.",
      "\"Like you said, there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players talking all the time. So, I understand that, but they're our players, and we need everyone to have a good season.\"",

      "Michael Owen has told Manchester United bosses to keep faith with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim has spent most of this season battling to save his job following a string of woeful results. But the Portuguese coach earned himself some much-needed breathing space with a stunning win at champions Liverpool last weekend.",
      "And former England, Liverpool and United striker Owen is convinced Amorim is the right man to lead the English giants back to the big time.",
      "Owen told Sky Bet: \"Ruben Amorim can be the man to lead Manchester United for years to come. When Erik ten Hag was in charge, I said from minute one that I couldn’t see it. I didn’t agree with his words or his style of football.",
      "\"But with Amorim, I like what he says and his principles. With time, investment, and stability, he can succeed. Some massive managers have failed at that club over the last decade, so at some point you have to stop chopping and changing and just stick with someone.",
      "\"The club has changed everything, managers, facilities, staff, even the boardroom. \"Now they need stability and time to piece it back together. That’s what Amorim can bring if he’s given the chance.\"",
      "Owen, meanwhile, claims one big problem United still have is the club's failure to make players improve - due to a 'toxic' environment.",
      "He added: \"There’s something in that([players struggling at Manchester United but thriving elsewhere).",
      "\"Name a Manchester United player in the last 10 years who's arrived and either stayed and got better, or left and got worse? You can't.",
      "\"But you can name loads who've gone the other way. That's not coincidence. The environment just hasn't been right. On the flip side, look at Liverpool.",
      "\"Players people once thought were average, have become world-class. When things are going right at a club, everything flows; when it's toxic, it drags everyone down.",
      "\"United’s had incredible players like Paul Pogba, Ángel Di María, Alexis Sánchez - all world-class when they arrived, all looked half the player in a United shirt. It’s been a tough place for players to flourish.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba is set to give Manchester United and Ruben Amorim a first-hand look at why they should splash the cash on him on the weekend when Brighton & Hove Albion visit Old Trafford. The 21-year-old Brighton star was linked with a move to United in the summer after being earmarked as the perfect midfield addition.",
      "Since his switch from Lille to Brighton, Baleba has emerged as one of Europe's standout defensive midfielders. However, after bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United had to put their interest in the Cameroonian ace on hold due to his hefty £100million price tag.",
      "Since then, chatter about Baleba's future at the AMEX Stadium has ramped up, amid reports he's feeling unsettled. Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has subbed Baleba off in three separate Premier League matches, adding fuel to the fire about his future.",
      "It's believed that United are keeping tabs on the situation, with a new midfielder high on Amorim's wish list when the transfer window swings open again. This Saturday, Baleba and his Brighton teammates head to Manchester aiming to extend their impressive run.",
      "Since a narrow defeat to Bournemouth in September, Hurzeler's squad have gone five games unbeaten, notching up notable wins against Chelsea and Newcastle. If Baleba keeps his place in the Brighton line-up, he'll have the perfect stage to show Amorim and the United top brass exactly why he should be their next marquee signing.",
      "All eyes will be on United following consecutive league victories under Amorim for the first time since he took charge. Last week's triumph over Liverpool came on the back of the win against Sunderland before the international break, substantially relieving the pressure on the United manager.",
      "Since taking over Moises Caicedo in Brighton's midfield, Baleba now finds himself in a spell of uncertainty. Worries about his performances since word emerged of United's interest have led to Hurzeler issuing a stark warning to the midfielder.",
      "\"I think we're getting to a time now where it's up to him, where he has to take responsibility as well,\" the Brighton boss said after the win over Newcastle. \"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton.",
      "\"No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.",
      "\"Now he has to make a step up and show personality, that's his next step in his personal development for sure. Like I said in the last weeks, there are waves in development, but you can only get out of it if you take ownership and if you take the responsibility, there are some moments where nobody can help you.",
      "\"You have to be your own support, your own help. He has the best environment here he can get, he has great team-mates who are there for him and support him.",
      "\"But now it's also up to the player that he steps up, that he shows personality and takes ownership of his development. That's what I demand from him in the future.\"",

      "Zirkzee has endured a tough spell at United since joining them from Bologna in a £36m deal, when Erik ten Hag was still in charge. The forward has failed to make an impact - and went on to become a figure of fun amongst United fans due to his lack of goals.",
      "The 24-year-old scored just seven goals in 49 appearances in all competitions last season. He has made just four appearances this time round, and his last league goal for United came 10 months ago in December.",

      "Sporting Lisbon fought back from a goal down to secure a 2-1 victory over Marseille in the Champions League on Wednesday evening, with ex-Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood withdrawn at the interval. Greenwood entered the match in fine form having netted four times against Le Havre days earlier.",
      "The 24-year-old has bagged seven goals and provided four assists this campaign, but was taken off by Marseille manager Roberto De Zerbi following the Ligue 1 outfit's first-half red card in Portugal. De Zerbi's decision to prioritise caution in the encounter has attracted criticism from French media.",
      "Several publications suggest the Italian somewhat limited his side's prospects of success by removing Greenwood and selecting a defensive approach, with De Zerbi apparently remaining sceptical about his defensive capabilities.",
      "Igor Paixao had fired Marseille ahead in the 14th minute. Yet after Emerson received his marching orders in first-half stoppage time for simulation whilst attempting to earn a penalty following Greenwood's set-up, De Zerbi altered his strategy.",
      "His choice to sacrifice attacking threat in pursuit of stability proved unsuccessful as Sporting gained momentum. Strikes from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos sealed Marseille's downfall.",
      "Before Greenwood's half-time substitution, French publication L'Equipe provided cautious commendation for his display. They said: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The publication also handed Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his showing in the opening 45 minutes. They said: \"Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, seemingly baffled by Greenwood's substitution given the player's overall reliability, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has questioned Greenwood's commitment off the ball ever since the former United star completed his move to France in July 2024. The Italian seized another opportunity to highlight Greenwood's obligations without possession after the loss to Sporting CP.",
      "\"Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.\"",
      "Speaking to Canal+, he further explained: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a centre forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's stern comments mirror those he made in March, when he expressed his expectations for his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "Naturally, Ferguson was closer to some players than others, including legendary captain Bryan Robson, who was integral to United’s success in the early 1990s. Robson rarely got the infamous ‘hairdryer’ treatment from Ferguson, which was picked up on by fellow players of the era.",
      "\"Robbo, Cantona, [Carlos] Tevez, obviously Ronaldo. Just unbelievable talent. Did you treat them all the same, or within reason did you have to do things accordingly?”",
      "Ferguson hilariously responded: “Well, everybody thought Robbo was my son because he never got criticised!” As McCoist laughed at the answer, Ferguson added: “I don’t really believe that [he never got criticised].",
      "“But anyway, I think the most important thing for me as a manager is to be consistent. So the players, the staff, everybody recognises the man who comes in the door every morning.",
      "“I had the same principles all the time, the same discipline code all the time, and the same attitude towards staff in particular all the time. I never changed. It made it easier for everybody to feel comfortable with that.”",

      "After hanging up his boots, Robson went on to manage Boro, leading the team to both domestic cup finals in 1997, only to be relegated from the top flight in the same season. The 68-year-old later managed Bradford City, West Brom and Sheffield United before a spell managing in Thailand.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes appears to exhibit several of the traits that legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson possessed when the Scot was in charge of the club. A day after United's 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield, United's stars reported back to training.",
      "As spotted in the video, 'Inside Arrivals', which was released by the Red Devils, Fernandes was displaying all the attributes that demonstrate why he's been club captain since the summer of 2023.",
      "Arriving for training, Fernandes made sure to greet everyone on the way in, asked how they were and even offered friendly fist bumps as he made his way into United's Carrington complex. His open demeanour and magnetic swagger echoes that of Sir Alex and shows the warmer side to his character.",
      "Ferguson was known to even have breakfast with the laundry staff at United, making sure he knew everyone by name. Archie Knox, a close friend who worked as his assistant manager at Aberdeen and United, believes that type of mentality, which is seemingly shared by Ferguson and Fernandes is key to long-term success.",
      "Via The Scottish Sun, Knox said: “One of the first things Alex told me when I came to Aberdeen was everybody is part of the club. He knew the ground staff, he knew the ladies in the kitchen, he made sure he knew them all. It was the same when we went to Manchester United.",
      "“The first thing we did in the morning, maybe before 8am, was to go into the laundry room at the training ground and have tea and toast with the women in there.\"",
      "While Fernandes is enjoying an upturn in form with United, his future could have lay elsewhere this summer. The Portuguese star looked certain to move to Saudi Arabia after reports Al-Hilal were ready to pay a £300million package to secure his signature.",
      "United would have collected a £100m transfer fee, with Fernandes being handed an eye-watering contract worth around £200m. He also could have linked up with two of his international team-mates in Saudi Arabia.",
      "“It would have been an easy move,\" he said. \"I had Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo there, two people I have a great friendship with. But I want to stay at the highest level, play in big competitions, because I still feel capable.\"",
      "Speaking in October, on the failed move he said: \"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup. That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",
      "However, any departure from the club seems to be in the dust for now and the captain has gone on to lead his side in exemplary fashion.",
      "Speaking with his leadership cap firmly on in the aftermath of the win over Liverpool, Fernandes warned his team-mates that they will have to maintain their performance levels.",
      "\"Today is for celebrating and enjoying the moment,\" the Red Devils captain told DAZN Portugal as quoted by O Jogo. \"I'll start thinking about it [the next game] tomorrow, because the focus has to quickly shift from today and move on to next week.",
      "\"Winning today is very nice, but if we don't win next week, it will be a dark cloud again. It's difficult to maintain a beautiful sky in Manchester.\"",
      "He added: \"It was a very important game. We obviously needed this win to get closer to the top spots. It was very important to win against a team that needed to win, and we also used that impatience to make them make some mistakes.\"",
      "Next up for Fernandes and United is a clash with Brighton on Saturday at Old Trafford as United bid to make it three Premier League wins on the bounce.",

      "Fresh off the back of beating Liverpool in the Premier League, Manchester United will be full of confidence going into their home fixture against Brighton this weekend. There are two away games against Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the next three outings, so a win at home could provide a springboard to kickstart their season.",
      "United's recent record against Spurs and Forest isn't too good, though, and Ruben Amorim will be hoping to swiftly stop the trend. Brighton also present a big challenge, having won on each of their last three visits to Old Trafford. Nevertheless, United have struggled with consistency so far this season and a result against their biggest rival is certainly the motivation they need to get the ball rolling.",
      "United icon Dwight Yorke is urging Amorim to make a change to his team ahead of the next game against Brighton. Despite the big win against Liverpool, Yorke thinks that new signing Benjamin Sesko should be starting.",
      "\"I think Benjamin Sesko needs to be Manchester United’s starting striker,\" Yorke told Esports Bets. \"We’ve seen the likes of Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha play in the position this season.",
      "\"But I think if you invest all this money in a striker, then you need to give him as much time as possible to adapt to the Premier League. I think he’s a fabulous player and works extremely hard.",
      "\"He’s playing in a team that isn’t scoring as regularly as they want, so there’s going to be times where he’ll find it tough going, but I think United should stick with him because he’s the best option for them in that position.\"",
      "United players made the most of the facilities at the new Carrington training base following their win over Liverpool, reports MailOnline, vindicating the club's £50m renovation.",
      "Six or seven players spent time in the ice baths, hot tubs and saunas after the game in order to aid their recovery, having just beaten Liverpool away from home for the first time in a decade.",
      "Players arrived at Carrington at 11.30am for a pre-match meal and team meeting and didn't return there until 9.30pm. However, players chose to make the most of the facilities available.",
      "Those who played on Sunday had a light gym session and recovery on Monday, with those who didn't having more of a tough challenge on the pitch.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo could be set for a reunion with United. The football legend re-joined the Red Devils in 2021 but left in 2022 in negative circumstances, having fallen out with former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Ronaldo could now be reunited with United in a very different way. Reports suggest that the Premier League club could be in line to face the Portuguese legend's current club Al-Nassr in a mid-season friendly.",
      "Speaking about the proposed reunion, former United assistant McCarthy told Best Betting Sites: \"I think the manner that he left, it wasn't a fitting manner for such an unbelievable, world-class player of his stature.",
      "\"So if that is the case that United get to play against Al Nassr, it will be a nice way for him as well to reconnect with the club that he's achieved so much with and the club that put him on the map in world football.",
      "\"It would [also] be a nice way for him to say goodbye to his team-mates. Because I know for a fact after that interview dropped he just left and we never saw him again.",
      "\"He never got to say goodbye to the players, to his team-mates and to the technical staff that was there. But this might give him a proper opportunity to reunite with the United faithful again. And the fans that will be there will give him a nice farewell, because that's what he deserves for what he's achieved at the club.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has reportedly been in private talks with Fabian Hurzeler, amid ongoing rumours linking him to Manchester United. The 21 year old was the talk of the town this summer, with the Red Devils showing interest in securing his services.",
      "Despite being a defensive-minded midfielder, Baleba managed to score three Premier League goals in 34 appearances last season, impressing many at the AMEX Stadium. Ruben Amorim and the United board were in-turn keen on bringing him onboard for the 2025/26.",
      "However, Brighton's hefty £100million price tag proved too steep for the Red Devils, as Baleba stayed put on the south east coast. Recent reports suggest that Baleba is unsettled at Brighton, with his half-time substitutions on three separate occasions this season adding fuel to the speculation.",
      "According to The Sun, United are keeping a close eye on Baleba's situation, despite the young player reaffirming his commitment to Hurzeler and Brighton.",
      "Pundits and supporters alike have been left scratching their heads as to why the United board didn't bolster their midfield during the summer transfer window, instead choosing to splash out over £200m on a new attacking trio of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Some have also questioned whether Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1 formation is the right fit for the Premier League, particularly given Bruno Fernandes' natural inclination towards an attacking role, and the fact that 33-year-old Casemiro can't cover as much ground as he used to.",
      "With a promising career ahead of him, Baleba could be the answer to Amorim's midfield woes. But with the January transfer window still some way off, the Portuguese manager may need to find solutions within his current squad.",
      "Meanwhile, United are reportedly eyeing up a move for VfB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller when the transfer window reopens. The 24-year-old has been turning heads in the Bundesliga this season, netting one goal and providing two assists in seven appearances.",
      "It comes as Manchester United will be able to keep tabs on Baleba up close this weekend, when they play host to Brighton in the Premier League.",
      "Spirits will be high within Amorim's dressing room at present, as they return to Old Trafford on a two-match winning streak thanks to a 2-0 win over Sunderland AFC ahead of the international break and a 2-1 result over fierce rivals Liverpool at Anfield upon their return to top flight action on Sunday.",
      "As a result of their recent run of form, United sit ninth in the Premier League standings, a point ahead of their upcoming opponents. Brighton, meanwhile, head into the clash unbeaten in their last four outings, with draws against Spurs and Wolves to their name, as well as wins over Chelsea and Newcastle United.",

      "Michael Owen believes Marcus Rashford could secure a permanent transfer to Barcelona. The 27-year-old is currently relishing a successful season-long loan at the Camp Nou, with his future at Old Trafford uncertain.",
      "Rashford found himself out of favour under Ruben Amorim shortly after the Portuguese manager's arrival in Manchester last November. Consequently, he spent the latter part of last season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester this summer, he was still left out of his manager's plans. As a result, he sought another move away from his boyhood club, whether that be on a permanent or a temporary basis.",
      "The England star's request was fulfilled when Barcelona signed him on a year-long deal, with the Spanish giants also having an option to buy him outright next summer for around £30million.",
      "And former United forward Owen believes the Catalans might decide to activate the clause. Speaking to 247Bet, Owen said: \"I think he has definitely got the ability to earn a permanent move there, and he's almost been given a new lease of life now.",
      "\"Some would say he's been very fortunate, because he'd been really off his games for a number of seasons. So this is a massive chance, and he's got to grab it with both hands.",
      "\"But I think he's very capable and, if his head is in the right place, then I think he will earn a permanent move.\"",
      "Since his move to Barcelona, Rashford has been on fire, netting five goals and providing six assists in just 12 appearances across all competitions, flourishing under the guidance of Hansi Flick.",
      "That's also despite fierce competition from players like Lamine Yamal and Raphinha. Rashford, who started as a centre-forward in Barca's Champions League match against Olympiakos on Tuesday night, managed to score twice in a 6-1 rout at home.",
      "His focus now shifts to Barcelona's biggest challenge yet, as they prepare to face off against Real Madrid in El Clasico this Sunday afternoon. United, meanwhile, have started to turn the tide in the Premier League as of recent.",
      "While Amorim's future was cast into speculation as a result of a poor start to the season, he has started to prove his worth with the club via a number of positive results as of late.",
      "The Red Devils secured a 2-0 win over a newly-promoted Sunderland AFC ahead of the international break. When Premier League action returned at the weekend, United were also able to steal a 2-1 win over bitter rivals Liverpool at Anfield, much to the rejoice of the red side of Manchester.",

      "Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has weighed in on Mohamed Salah's current slump at Liverpool. The Egyptian has been struggling to replicate his stellar form from last season.",
      "The Reds are hoping to dodge a fifth consecutive loss in all competitions as they gear up to face Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League this Wednesday night. In a surprising move, manager Arne Slot has decided to bench Salah for the crucial European showdown in Germany.",
      "This bold decision follows Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher's recent comments suggesting that the forward is no longer a guaranteed starter for the Reds. It appears Hugo Ekitike is poised to take over the right wing position, a spot that Liverpool's No.11 has dominated at Anfield since his arrival in 2017.",
      "Meulensteen has offered his insights into what might be going wrong for the 33-year-old this season, following an impressive 2024/2025 campaign where he netted 34 goals for Slot's squad.",
      "\"I think the absence of Trent Alexander-Arnold might be a factor [in Liverpool's form] as players often build partnerships and connections, instinctively knowing where to pass the ball. I believe this understanding is crucial,\" he shared via CasinoHawks, a platform for the latest online casinos.",
      "\"Florian Wirtz is another player who's still finding his feet. He didn't start against Man Utd, but played well when he came on. The front line simply needs to gel together. Cody Gakpo, who played well on Sunday, is still there, but Mo Salah seemed off.",
      "\"This was a bit strange, especially since he recently scored for Egypt in the World Cup qualifiers, helping them reach the World Cup, a significant achievement. However, there were moments yesterday [on Sunday vs Man Utd] where he didn't seem like himself, like the missed shot near the goal.",
      "\"Technically, it was a complete misconnection, when normally he would open up his body and place it into the far corner.\"",
      "Whilst plenty will be wondering what's behind Salah's unexpected dip in form, Meulensteen reckons there's no need for alarm.",
      "He added: \"Salah is an experienced player. In my opinion, we shouldn't expend too much energy on it; like I said with Arne, just reassure and reinforce him.",
      "\"Last year, they found a good defensive role for Salah, while also giving him the freedom to hold certain positions from which Liverpool could quickly counter-attack.",
      "\"They executed this brilliantly. I think it's a combination of so many young, new players settling in, and he's just going through a bit of a poor spell at the moment, but he'll come good. He hasn't become a bad player overnight.\"",

The Dutch forward has completed just 82 minutes of football this term after being knocked down the pecking order following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the transfer window.",
      "Despite that, United are reluctant to allow Zirkzee to depart, but that will not immediately deter the Irons, according to The i Paper. The former Bologna ace is exploring his options ahead of the winter window.",

      "Martinez has not played for United since being injured in a 2-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on February 2, 262 days ago. He has missed 35 United games in total since then with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and has been a significant miss for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Argentina international has been patiently working behind the scenes at the club’s Carrington training ground and is now near a significant milestone. United had hoped that Martinez would join Amorim’s first team group last week, but that ended up not being the case.",
      "United are keen to take a very cautious approach to reintegrating Martinez, aware that ACL injuries can be difficult. However, Martinez has been given the all clear on his knee, with scans showing that injury has fully healed and he is expected to now train with his team-mates for the first time in eight months.",
      "Martinez is a key player for United in central defence, where Amorim also has Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Luke Shaw, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven as options. His eventual return will increase competition for places in the three-man defence, where Martinez was previously favoured.",
      "Casemiro summed up the feeling around his impending return in an interview with the club website last week. “Licha is on the final straight,” the United midfielder said. “He is a soldier who works so hard. He is always in the gym working hard. He is a machine that works so hard. He is one of those players that loves to work hard.",

I will be so glad for his return. It’s not just me, everyone is happy, because he is an essential player at the club that works so hard.”",
      "Martinez may have not been able to contribute in matches or on the training pitch, but he has still been around the group whenever possible. “We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him,” Amorim explained last month.",

      "A sensational reunion between Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United could soon be on the horizon. Reports suggest the Red Devils are considering arranging a mid-season friendly against Ronaldo's current club, Al-Nassr, at some point over the coming months.",
      "The proposed fixture, set to take place in Saudi Arabia, would offer the Portuguese icon a fitting opportunity to bid farewell to United supporters after his second spell at Old Trafford ended on a sour note. Ronaldo returned to United in 2021 after 12 years away, but his contract was terminated little over a year later following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan, during which he openly criticised both the club and manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Benni McCarthy, who served as Ten Hag's assistant at the time, has since insisted that despite the acrimonious nature of Ronaldo's departure, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner still deserves the chance to have a proper send-off from the fans.",
      "\"I think the manner that he left, it wasn't a fitting manner for such an unbelievable, world-class player of his stature,\" McCarthy told Best Betting Sites. \"So if that is the case that United get to play against Al Nassr, it will be a nice way for him as well to reconnect with the club that he's achieved so much with and the club that put him on the map in world football.",

But this might give him a proper opportunity to reunite with the United faithful again. And the fans that will be there will give him a nice farewell, because that's what he deserves for what he's achieved at the club.\"",
      "Ronaldo's second spell at Manchester United began promisingly but his return coincided with a dip in form that ultimately cost manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. Although the Portuguese forward continued to find the net regularly, critics argued that his presence was tactically detrimental.",
      "He finished the season with an impressive 24 goals in all competitions, yet his efforts weren't enough to secure Champions League qualification for United. Over the summer, Ronaldo grew increasingly disillusioned with the club's direction and expressed his desire to leave.",
      "After missing much of United's pre-season in an attempt to engineer a move away, Ronaldo found himself on the fringes under new manager Ten Hag, often omitted from the starting line-up.",
      "In his interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo claimed he felt \"betrayed\" by Ten Hag and criticised United for becoming a shadow of the club they once were under Sir Alex Ferguson. His contract was terminated on the eve of the 2022 World Cup, after which he signed with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr.",
      "In the years since, Ronaldo has scored an astonishing 105 goals in 118 appearances, spearheading a footballing revolution in the Gulf nation. His arrival paved the way for a wave of high-profile stars to follow him to Saudi Arabia, transforming the league's global profile.",
      "Although Ronaldo's departure from United left a bitter aftertaste, he remains a beloved figure among the club's supporters - and the chance to see him grace the pitch against United one final time would surely be welcomed.",
      "The Red Devils have been looking at planning some money-spinning friendlies, which would also help fill the midweek void left after failing to qualify for European competition, with Al-Nassr emerging as potential opponents.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim has already expressed his enthusiasm for arranging such fixtures, raising the prospect of an emotional reunion between Ronaldo and his former club. \"We have to do it. And you know, we knew that when we missed out on Europe, we have a lot of things to do,\" he said.",

      "Ex-Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has sung the praises of new Manchester United shot-stopper Senne Lammens and insists he won't crumble under pressure if he commits a costly error. Lammens has hit the ground running and made a huge impression since his £18.2million summer move.",
      "The Belgian joined United on deadline day, signing a five-year contract, and his since established himself as the club's No 1 keeper. The 23-year-old is considered among Europe's most promising young keepers and has already made his mark during his initial period at M16.",
      "Lammens secured a clean sheet on his United bow against Sunderland before delivering another assured display in Sunday's 2-1 triumph over reigning Premier League champions Liverpool. United's decision to sign a new goalkeeper represents a U-turn from previous comments made by Ruben Amorim, who insisted that he would be sticking with Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır.",
      "That decision has already paid dividends with Lammens earning widespread praise for his early performances. And if Mignolet's comments are anything to go by, United have got themselves a much more dependable keeper between the sticks than they've had in years.",
      "Speaking about the Belgian, Mignolet offered his assessment on what makes his fellow countryman so exceptional, having shared the pitch with him at Club Brugge in Belgium's top flight.",
      "\"He has the build and the qualities to succeed in England. He's big, explosive, and strong on high balls. And he can save balls that other goalkeepers can't,\" Mignolet said, via Voetbal Primeur.",
      "\"With his shot-stopping, he can score points for United. He's steady in his head and handles pressure well.\"",
      "Crucially for United supporters - and something that will undoubtedly be music to their ears - Mignolet disclosed that Lammens possesses the mental fortitude to recover from setbacks, something previous keeper Onana struggled with. Mignolet added: \"He has the ability to bounce back after a mistake and stay calm.\"",
      "United's goalkeeping woes have been a persistent headache for some time, but Lammens's promising early displays will provide massive hope for Red Devils supporters following the tribulations of Onana and Bayındır. Onana was ultimately loaned out to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor for the season after a series of costly blunders.",
      "Former United skipper Gary Neville has previously voiced his conviction that the Red Devils require shot-stoppers with a commanding presence and strong mentality.",
      "\"You've got to have personality, stability and character in that position.\"",
      "Lammens seems to possess these qualities, judging by testimonials from Mignolet and other former colleagues.",
      "Former Fulham defender Denis Odoi, who witnessed Lammens's abilities firsthand at both Club Brugge and Antwerp, has outlined why the promising keeper could match the template Neville has demanded at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Senne is rather introverted, even in the dressing room. He's not very exuberant. That calmness is typical of his personality,\" he said.",
      "\"He's very conscientious. He really does everything he can to make sure he can't blame himself for anything.",
      "\"Sometimes we'd come back from a match against Club Brugge at 1 a.m. and he'd still be in the gym. Because he hadn't played as a second-choice goalkeeper, he wanted to get some work done.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has revealed the opportunity to feature in El Clasico against Real Madrid was among the key factors behind his summer switch to Barcelona. The striker secured a loan move to the Catalan club from Manchester United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona have an option to make the arrangement permanent next year for a fee of £26 million. Rashford continued his impressive form as he netted twice in his team's commanding 6-1 Champions League victory over Olympiacos on Tuesday night.",
      "Next up for Barca is a showdown with arch-rivals Real at the Santiago Bernabeu this Sunday. And it is match that Rashford is eagerly anticipating.",
      "\"The Clasico is a great game and that's why I've come here for this number of games,\" he said. \"I am looking forward to it, I hope we win.\"",
      "Despite previously insisting that his optimal role is out wide on the left flank, he thrived in a more central striking position against the Greek outfit. And following Tuesday night's win, Rashford confessed: \"It could be my best performance with Barca.",
      "\"I'm ready to bring out the best in me in the team. I prefer to play on the wing, but I don't care. I intend to help and do the best I can.\"",
      "The remarks follow Barcelona manager Hansi Flick's endorsement of Rashford's capabilities in a central role. \"Marcus can be a No.9 or a No.11, he told TNT Sport.",
      "\"When we think of him, we value the fact that he can play in more than one position. He has given us a lot of positives and, of course, he can play as a centre forward.\"",
      "An injury to Ferran Torres resulted in Rashford being deployed centrally against Olympiacos. However, Torres' return to fitness means he could be shifted back to a wide position for this weekend's Clasico.",

The 23-year-old progressed through the academies of Czech sides Boskovice and Zbrojovka Brno before signing for Atalanta in 2017.",
      "After impressing with the Italian side's Primavera and Under-17s, Vorlický made his professional debut in a 2-1 Serie A defeat to Lecce in February 2023. He played a further seven minutes across the next two games against AC Milan and Udinese before suffering a serious knee injury.",
      "Not long after that, he moved back to the Czech Republic with Slavia Prague, while the likes of Amad and Dejan Kulusevski joined Europe's top teams. United paid £19million for Amad when he was 18, in October 2020, with him joining the club under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January 2021.",
      "After loan spells with Rangers and Sunderland, the Ivory Coast star is now a key member of Ruben Amorim's side. Kulusevski was snapped up by Juventus in 2020 after being awarded the Serie A Best Young Player of the Season.",
      "Two years later, the Sweden international joined Tottenham on an 18-month loan, before that switch was made permanent. Both players, when fit, are regulars in the Premier League for their sides.",
      "In total, Vorlický endured five knee surgeries in seven years during his spell at Atalanta. Since returning to Prague, he has only managed 14 games for the first-team, and an additional 10 for their B side, with injuries further limiting his availability.",
      "Speaking with the Czech newspaper DNES, Vorlický has opened up about his terrible luck and how he believes he could have joined Amad and Kulusevski at United or Tottenham. \"I don't want this to sound cocky, but yes,\" he said when asked if he could play at the same level as the pair.",
      "\"People have been telling me since I was a child that I could grow up and to be a great footballer. Even more so at Atalanta, because everyone at the club believed in me.",
      "\"But I was also always aware that I was a boy from Boskovice who used to go to the gravel pitch with his friends after school to kick a ball.\" Asked if he blames previous doctors for his unfortunate injuries, he added: \"Why? He's only human.",
      "\"He operated on ten people that day, I got bad luck, that happens, I can't change it. Who knows what would have happened if I had been healthy? I'm humanly happy. Would I have been the same if I had continued? I have no idea. I'm just sorry that I didn't play.\"",

He finished twice into the near post to wrongfoot goalkeeper Konstantinos Tzolakis to ensure three points in the Champions League for his new club.",
      "The Manchester United loanee was fielded as the centre-forward by Flick, who was without the injured Robert Lewandowski and left Ferran Torres on the bench. Rashford looked the part and has now either scored or assisted in eight of his last nine appearances for Barca.",
      "He is only on loan until the end of the season, but has not tried to hide his happiness at being in Catalonia or at his desire to stay in the long term. Barca have the option to make his move permanent for around €30million (£26m) and Flick’s post-match comments hinted they might just do so.",
      "“For me, Rashford is performing very well and is an important player for the team. He won a penalty, which I thought was a penalty, and scored two goals,” Flick said. “He’s very fast, combines very well, and as he gains confidence, he will become more important.”",
      "Rashford has generally played off the left wing in recent years, but took the central role on Tuesday night, with Lamine Yamal on the right, Fermin Lopez in the No.10 position and youngster Dro Fernandez on the left wing. Yamal converted the penalty won by Rashford, while Lopez netted a hat-trick.",
      "“Rashford played well today,\" Flick added. “It's not easy for him to play that number nine role. The first minutes of the match I guess we were struggling to press, but at the end the chances he had and the penalty he won...",
      "\"The important thing is that he scored goals. He's giving me 100 per cent of what I want from him.\"",
      "Rashford clearly feels the same, posting snaps from the game on Instagram with the caption: “Amazing night at home. What a TEAM! ! Visca Barca.\"",
      "Barcelona sit second in La Liga, two points behind rivals Real Madrid, while they are ninth in the early Champions League table, with two wins and one defeat. They face Real in El Clasico on Sunday at the Bernabeu in a major test of their form.",
      "Asked about their previous results against Real, Flick said: “That’s in the past. We’re in a different situation now, but I’m optimistic. I think we can win in Madrid. We have a great team, we’ll have two or more players back, and we have time to rest and prepare for the game.”",

      "Harry Maguire was on hand to head home Manchester United's winner at Liverpool on Sunday but a post on social media praising his exploits with his head were mocked by Sevilla.",
      "The centre-half scored the winning goal at Anfield on Sunday to end his side's decade-long wait for a win on the red half of Merseyside. It isn't the first time Maguire has come up with big goals over recent seasons - one of those being on the European stage.",
      "United enjoyed a stunning comeback in last season's Europa League quarter-final as they scored three times in seven minutes to beat Lyon at Old Trafford. It was Maguire who headed home in the final minute of extra-time to set off jubilant scenes in Manchester.",
      "The Europa League's Twitter page put out the video and referenced how Maguire was renowned for scoring \"clutch headers\" in the aftermath of his Liverpool exploits.",
      "But the post was somewhat hijacked when it was reposted by Sevilla, who included another video of European action that saw Maguire head into his own net when the Spanish side rescued a game at Old Trafford, drawing 2-2 after they had trailed by two goals.",
      "That was back in Erik ten Hag's time at the club but proved to be a crushing blow. United looked to be cruising to a first-leg win in the knockout stages of the tournament, only for the La Liga outfit to score twice late on thanks to a brace of own goals to ensure parity ahead of the second-leg.",
      "The Spanish side enjoyed a triumphant 3-0 victory back on their own patch to send United packing from Europe. Sevilla were gifted the lead after eight minutes when Youssef En-Nesyri finished following an error from Maguire.",
      "There was talk of Ten Hag looking to offload Maguire during his time in Manchester, but the defender remained and has continued to underline his importance. Ruben Amorim has continued to make use of the England international with his biggest contribution coming on Sunday.",
      "Maguire's future in Manchester remains unclear with the centre-half into the final year of his contract - and no formal offer yet made to the 32-year-old. If the club want to retain the England international they will have to offer him fresh terms.",
      "Given he is now in the final eight months of his deal he could sign a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January 1. The Daily Mail report that regular discussions continue between the club and the player but a decision from the hierarchy is yet to be made.",

      "It was a brave decision from Ruben Amorim to bench Benjamin Sesko against Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Sesko had scored twice in his last two matches for Manchester United, but Amorim decided to revert to the striker-less front three he picked for the first three games of the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo looked threatening in those matches, but none of the three scored when all on the pitch together (Mbeumo only scored against Burnley once Mount was substituted).",
      "Although there was the potential for United to be blunt at Anfield, Mbeumo scored within two minutes at the Kop, finishing brilliantly following a perfectly-weighted pass from Amad.",
      "The decision to play with a striker-less front three worked a treat. Mbeumo, Cunha and Mount were excellent and Amorim now has a tough selection decision for Brighton's visit to Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "Should Amorim persist with the striker-less attack that delivered at Anfield? United had one of the worst attacks in the league last season and it must be refreshing for Amorim to have a selection dilemma.",
      "It's a welcome headache for Amorim. The 40-year-old has strong attacking options at his disposal and can tweak the team accordingly to adapt to the opposition this season.",
      "The attacking pieces have fallen into place for Amorim and he will be aware of the importance of getting his team selection right against Brighton when considering what is at stake.",
      "The Liverpool victory was outstanding, but it must serve as a springboard for further success, so the visit of Brighton is arguably just as important as last weekend's visit to Anfield.",
      "United have a huge opportunity to win three games in a row and could possibly enter the November international break in the Champions League places if they build on their result against Liverpool.",
      "There would be logic in rewarding Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo for their performances in Merseyside by starting them against Brighton, as managers can be reluctant to change a winning team. There would also be logic in recalling Sesko to the starting XI, given his form before the Anfield visit.",
      "It will be a difficult decision for Amorim to make ahead of this weekend, but he prepared for the new season with a frontman in his plans and perhaps the scales will tip in Sesko's favour.",
      "Cunha, Mount and Mbeumo have developed an impressive understanding, however, there is a strong argument to play Sesko down the middle this weekend.",
      "Sesko arrived at Old Trafford in the summer window for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons. He could reach 20 goals this season if the attack clicks into gear, but Mount or Cunha are unlikely to reach that figure down the middle.",
      "Sesko has found his feet in Manchester over the last month, following his first goal against Brentford with a clever strike against Sunderland, and could be on the cusp of a purple patch if he's given starts.",
      "The ceiling for the striker-less front three is essentially lower than that of an attack including Sesko, which is why Amorim should recall the Slovenia international to the XI to face Brighton.",
      "In that scenario, who is moved to the bench is arguably an even bigger headache, but it has to be between Mount and Cunha, who would compete to start on the left side of the attack.",
      "Mbeumo has made an excellent start to the campaign and has the right side locked down, while it's difficult to choose between Mount and Cunha on the left after the last fortnight.",
      "Mount was superb against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. Cunha was recalled at Anfield and his clever game management was key in the closing stages of the contest.",
      "It's encouraging Amorim has tough decisions to make in a department that struggled last season.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "For once, Manchester United do not seem like the kind of team who are desperately counting down the days to the start of a transfer window.",
      "In recent years, United have looked a mess with several areas of pitch in desperate need of improvement, mid-season. This time last year, we had just seen the Reds draw at Fenerbahce in the Europa League as they continued their simultaneously unbeaten and winless start to that competition and we were less than a week away from the West Ham defeat that ended Sir Jim Ratcliffe's patience with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Fast forward 12 months and not everything is perfect at United, there is an acceptance that the recovery will take time but at least we are starting to see some green shoots of hope. Yes, the midfield needs a major overhaul but that seems like it could be a task saved until the summer.",
      "Therefore, the actual priorities list for new arrivals will likely depend upon who departs. Again though, United will not be expected to allow loads of players to exit.",
      "January remains a seller's market but it also makes replacement additions hard to come by. However, the player they should prioritise to leave this winter does not have to necessarily be replaced.",
      "In the summer, Diego Leon arrived in Manchester full of confidence. \"When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity,\" the full-back told the Paraguayan media in July.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "As much as you can admire Leon's confidence, things have not quite worked out like that for him. The 18-year-old has made just two appearances in United colours - his latest coming in the 5-2 defeat to Barnsley in the EFL Trophy in midweek.",
      "In fact, he has yet to make an appearance for the senior squad. He made the bench against Manchester City, Brentford and Sunderland but was missing on Sunday at Liverpool.",
      "With United's injury problems starting to diminish, Leon's opportunities to break into the first-team this season are starting to dwindle too. In pre-season we saw signs of why the teenager was signed and he did impress, particularly against Leeds.",
      "However, he still needs time to adapt to European football and a loan spell away from Old Trafford in January could be just what is needed. Of course, the club chosen for him needs to be right.",
      "United have a long-standing tradition of sending the youngsters who they favour most, to the Championship. This season Harry Amass, Radek Vitek and Toby Collyer are among the players battling in the English second tier at Sheffield Wednesday, Bristol City and West Bromwich Albion respectively.",
      "We must remember that it was only recently that Amad changed the course of his United career playing for Sunderland in the Championship, so it would be a sign of confidence in Leon to organise a similar switch for him. By the end of the season, Tyrell Malacia will have left and Leon will re-enter the squad with further experience which could help him make that jump to the first-team.",
      "If opportunities are not going to be forthcoming for Leon this campaign, this has to be the club's priority going into January.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt believes he's entering his prime at Manchester United. De Ligt is the only player to have played every minute of United's Premier League season.",
      "The Dutchman has been excellent and is hugely important to Ruben Amorim. De Ligt has been a standout performer in the dressing room and helped United to claim a victory against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "De Ligt joined from Bayern Munich for an initial €45million (£38.4m) in the summer of 2024 and his performances in his first season were mixed, but he is now delivering consistent displays.",
      "The defender recently sat down for an interview with MUTV and put his strong performances down to having a strong pre-season. De Ligt also suggested the best is yet to come from him.",
      "\"I am feeling quite good, to be fair,” said De Ligt. \"I am happy with the way I started, personally. I feel good physically and mentally. I try to help the team as much as possible in every game.",
      "\"Obviously, we are not in the place where we want to be in the long term, but I feel like we are also improving as a team and, hopefully in the next weeks, we can get some good results.”",
      "Asked for the reasons behind his improved form, De Ligt said: “Well, the first thing that’s really important is I had a proper pre-season. I feel, for me and my body, pre-season is always really important.",
      "\"I think it was one of the first pre-seasons in five or six years when I didn't have a transfer, an injury or a Euros. The last time was probably my last season at Ajax and that was actually one of the best seasons of my career! I feel it is a big thing that is really important. “I feel that mentally and physically I am in a really good place. I feel quite confident. Obviously, my teammates and the manager help a lot because they give me this confidence.",
      "\"I think I am also used to the Premier League as well now, the pace, which helps also. Overall, these are the most important things that take me to this level at the moment.”",
      "He continued: \"I am a really big critic of myself but I have become a little softer because sometimes I was too critical and it didn't help me much. Now I am a little bit more balanced, I think.”",
      "\"They [friends and family] do provide feedback, but not in a way that's too much, they just speak to me about the game. Mostly, it is more about how the game went for the team instead of my performances, it is more about how we played, if we won or not.",
      "\"They know that I know how I played. Nobody has to say to me, before or after a game, how I played or what I should have done differently because they know that I am the biggest critic of myself.”",
      "De Ligt added: “I feel that I am coming to my prime age now. I think as a defender, normally around 29, 30, 31, you are at your best. I am now 26 and I think I have experienced a lot in my career and I can use this experience to my advantage. Hopefully I can keep continuing that.”",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action this weekend when they take on Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford. Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured a 2-1 victory for the Reds against Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "While on the transfer front, United are being linked with a host of new names. The latest is Dusan Vlahovic who is out of contract with Juventus next summer.",
      "United also reportedly remain interested in VfB Stuttgart star Angelo Stiller. According to a report from Germany, he is valued at €50m, one of several sides looking at the 24-year-old.",
      "In the midfield department, Morten Hjulmand persistently finds himself linked with a move to Old Trafford. Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton are also reportedly on their radar ahead of January.",
      "While on the takeover front, a consortium from the United Arab Emirates are reportedly preparing to make an offer to buy the Glazers majority shares in the club. It has also been claimed the consortium would like David Beckham - who already has ownership interests in Inter Miami and Salford - to be an ambassador for the bid.",
      "Man United are reportedly considering a move for Athletic Club star Oihan Sancet.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes have claimed that the Reds are preparing a €70m offer to test Athletic's resolve. Arsenal have also been linked.",
      "For once, Manchester United do not seem like the kind of team who are desperately counting down the days to the start of a transfer window.",
      "In recent years, United have looked a mess with several areas of pitch in desperate need of improvement, mid-season. This time last year, we had just seen the Reds draw at Fenerbahce in the Europa League as they continued their simultaneously unbeaten and winless start to that competition and we were less than a week away from the West Ham defeat that ended Sir Jim Ratcliffe's patience with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Fast forward 12 months and not everything is perfect at United, there is an acceptance that the recovery will take time but at least we are starting to see some green shoots of hope. Yes, the midfield needs a major overhaul but that seems like it could be a task saved until the summer.",
      "Read the full story from Jack Flintham here.",
      "Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller is a player that Manchester United are monitoring before the January transfer window, according to Fabrizio Romano, despite false reports of a late move this summer.",
      "Now, speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano has revealed that no talks have been held between United and Stuttgart just yet, but there is genuine interest held. \"I'm always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller, there was a report from Bild in the last few days on Manchester United tracking the player,\" he said.",
      "\"Manchester United have always been following this player and Angelo Stiller is really appreciated internally. Last summer, we had some stories about Manchester United going on a mission to Germany negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks.",
      "\"No, Manchester United never started any negotiations for Angelo Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility. It was always impossible.",
      "\"Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August, so there was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "\"But Angelo still remains a player monitored by Manchester United. They are following him.",
      "\"They are closely monitoring his progress. Again, at the moment, there's no negotiation, no talks.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford is a popular member of the Barcelona squad as he continues on loan from Manchester United.",
      "And journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed that not only is Rashford a popular member of Hansi Flick’s squad, but there is also a possibility that he will remain at the Catalan club beyond this season.",
      "“Rashford is sending very clear messages, his desire to be a Barcelona player is there since January 2025, so basically almost one year ago,\" he said in a video on his YouTube channel.",
      "“In the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Marcus Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco. Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and completed the transfer on a deal with a €30million buy option clause, but now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions – between goals and assists – and doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“He can play as a striker, he can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona, and, once again, as I have been telling you for weeks, the feeling internally at Barca is that Rashford really perfectly fits the structure they have on the tactical point of view with Barcelona.",
      "“They are all very happy with all the relationship Rashford has with his team-mates as well. The reputation of Rashford is something that has to be clarified. He is really popular in the dressing room at Barcelona.",
      "“Look at the image after the game of Fermin Lopez scores an attack against Olympiacos, Marcus Rashford, who scored two goals, took the ball and went to Fermin Lopez, telling him, okay, take the ball, because, also, this kind of behaviour is something really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "\"The performance is okay, of course, goals, assists, Rashford is doing very well, very versatile player upfront who can play in several positions, but also important to say, the behaviour, the attitude of Marcus Rashford is really appreciated by Barcelona.",
      "“So, let me say, from what I understand, the feeling internally at Barcelona – internal means board, management, technical staff, the manager and those who work closely with Hansi Flick – is that if Marcus Rashford will continue like this in every single point of view – delivering performances and perfect attitude – he will have very good chances to continue at the club beyond this season.”",
      "Manchester United reportedly remain interested in VfB Stuttgart star Angelo Stiller.",
      "That's according to journalist Dennis Bayer, via Sport Witness, who is reporting that United are one of several sides looking at the 24-year-old, who is open to taking the next step in his career.",
      "The report also goes on to cliam that Stuttgart have set a €50m asking price on the player - but it is unclear if that is the value of the release clause in his current deal.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is set to request a transfer away from Manchester United in the upcoming window, with West Ham United leading the race to provide the Dutch international an exit route from his Old Trafford woes.",
      "Zirkzee's time at United has been challenging since his £36m move from Bologna under Erik ten Hag. The forward has struggled to make his mark, becoming a target of mockery among United supporters due to his goal drought.",
      "Read the full story from Jeremy Cross here.",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has had his say on what he believes the Glazers are asking for to sell their shares in Manchester United.",
      "“I think it’s unlikely [a takeover] will be how its played out, when Ratcliffe came in we saw how that played out,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“A big bid from Qatar we were led to believe that was full takeover and it wasn’t at the price that the Glazers wanted. I’ve always suggested that they are after a higher price for their exit which is certainly more than £5billion, there’s been rumours that they want £10billion in the future to exit.",
      "“With football clubs though we say it all the time they’re really for sale, if the right offer comes in then people will listen.”",
      "Manchester United have reportedly been informed that Juventus are willing to put their striker Dusan Vlahovic up for sale in the January transfer window.",
      "The 25-year-old arrived from Fiorentina in 2022 however, his time in Turin turned sour last season over disputes regarding a new contract offer. It is understood that Vlahovic was offered a deal with a lower wage as Juve tried to lower their salary bill at the club amidst the looming threat of Financial Fair Play (FFP).",
      "In January, Vlahovic will be able to sign a pre-contract agreement with any club overseas - including United. However, Gazzetta dello Sport claim Juve are going to be pushing to sell him in January to reclaim some money.",
      "Carlos Baleba is said to have held private discussions with Fabian Hurzeler, as Manchester United continue to be linked with the Brighton midfielder.",
      "The 21-year-old was the talk of the town this summer, with the Reds holding talks with the Seagulls over securing Baleba's services. The youngster impressed at the AMEX Stadium last term, with three Premier League goals from 34 outings in total, despite being defensive-minded.",
      "And as a result, Ruben Amorim and the Manchester United board were keen on securing his services for 2025/26. However, determined to retain the Cameroonian for the news season, Brighton slapped Baleba with an audacious price tag of £100million, which ultimately proved too rich for United's liking.",

      "Manchester United are a team full of confidence after their victory over Liverpool last weekend.",
      "The result at Anfield was not only their best of the campaign but it was also a display that they could be proud of. From the first whistle United were excellent and they were rewarded with an early goal.",
      "United should have added to their advantage in the first half when Bruno Fernandes clipped the post. While Cody Gakpo's equaliser came as a bitter blow at the time, it was nothing more than the Reds deserved when Harry Maguire nodded home the winner.",
      "It has been well documented that the win over Liverpool saw United record back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time under Amorim, and the Reds will be hoping to make it three in a row on Saturday when Brighton arrive at Old Trafford.",
      "United managed to set the tone perfectly at Anfield thanks to their overload down the right-hand side in the opening moments. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo caused the Liverpool backline no end of problems in the first 45 minutes in particular.",
      "Virgil van Dijk did not know whether he was coming or going with the two players attacking that side. Matthijs de Ligt spoke after the game about knowing to target the Liverpool full-backs and doing similar on Saturday could expose Ferdi Kadioglu if he starts once again.",
      "Brighton play in the same 4-2-3-1 system as Liverpool and it is expected that Danny Welbeck will lead the line as Alexander Isak did on Sunday.",
      "United will need to watch out for the through ball from deep that caught them out last weekend - with Senne Lammens bailing them out with a fine save from Isak. Fabian Hurzeler will have watched United at Liverpool and may look to expose the backline with similar through balls from deep.",
      "But if United can expose the opposition full-backs, as they did at Anfield, they could enjoy another fruitful outing.",

      "On paper, Manchester United are preparing for one of their most evenly matched contests of the season so far this weekend.",
      "Brighton have scored one more and conceded one fewer than United, but Ruben Amorim's Reds are one point better off than Fabian Hurzeler's side. After such a confidence boosting victory over Liverpool last time out, United would be forgiven for picking an unchanged side.",
      "However, if Amorim did fancy rotating his XI or potentially even making it stronger, he could consider welcoming Noussair Mazraoui back into the starting line-up. Before the Liverpool game, the Portuguese head coach admitted that he was unsure whether the Moroccan would be fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Thankfully for Mazraoui and United, he was, and arrived with his teammates at Anfield. The 27-year-old was only fit enough to make the bench but another week's training under his belt should have pushed him to a position where he could start this weekend.",
      "If that were to be the case, his inclusion could shore up the left-hand side on Saturday. Following his display at Anfield on Sunday, Amad seems destined to start once again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Ivorian produced one of his best performances of the season and was a constant threat throughout. His assist inside the opening two minutes justified exactly why he was included despite a mixed start to the season.",
      "Ultimately, United cannot afford to exclude Amad from Saturday's line-up but they must be wary of the counter. A couple of times, Liverpool sprung a quick break on the Reds and it is something to bear in mind.",
      "If United were to bring Mazraoui back into their starting line-up this weekend, he could help United avoid being caught by the Brighton counter attack.",
      "Mazraoui could feature in the left wing-back role, providing balance to the system. The Seagulls will look to counter with Yankuba Minteh on the right so having a player like Mazraoui should help to block that threat. Diogo Dalot started on the left at Anfield but struggled in one of his worst performances of the season as he attempted to provide an attacking threat.",
      "Starting the more defensive-minded Mazraoui would offer United options off the bench, with Patrick Dorgu waiting in the wings to provide a more attacking threat if required.",
      "Either way, Amorim will have the luxury of options this weekend.",

      "Manchester United are facing a possible nightmare scenario in midfield with Casemiro close to another suspension in the Premier League.",
      "The Brazilian has started six of United's first eight league games of the season, missing the 3-1 loss to Brentford due to suspension. Casemiro picked up a red card courtesy of two yellow cards in the 2-1 win over Chelsea in September.",
      "Ruben Amorim has opted to play the 33-year-old alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield this season, despite previous concerns and doubts over his ability to play at the top level.",
      "However, as the fixtures continue to come thick and fast for United, they will be sweating over the possibility of losing the experienced midfielder for one game. Premier League rules mean that five yellow cards in the opening 19 games of the season will result in a one-game ban.",
      "Despite playing just seven games, Casemiro has already received five cards this season - which is counted as three bookings because the other two resulted in a sending off. He picked up a yellow card in the first-half of the 1-1 draw at Fulham before being shown two yellow cards in the win over Chelsea.",
      "Upon returning from his initial one-game ban, the Brazil international was booked in back-to-back games against Sunderland and Liverpool, meaning two more cautions will see him miss another game.",
      "So, if Casemiro is booked in Saturday's game against Brighton and the following one at Nottingham Forest, he would miss the huge trip to Tottenham Hotspur on November 8.",
      "After 19 games, the threshold will refresh to 10 yellow cards, meaning that any player who reaches that by matchday 32 will serve a two-match suspension. So far, only Everton's Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has served a one-game ban for five yellow cards.",
      "If Casemiro does pick up two more yellow cards, Amorim will be forced to turn to one of his two waiting midfield options in Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo. Previously, the Portuguese claimed that the latter is competing with Fernandes, which would mean Ugarte is likely to be preferred.",

      "Marcus Rashford is a popular member of the Barcelona squad as he continues on loan from Manchester United. The England international moved to the La Liga giants during the summer transfer window after being deemed surplus to requirements by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Catalan giants have the option to make his move permanent for £30million in 2026. Rashford has scored four goals and six assists across all competitions for Barcelona so far this season, while his performances in general have also impressed.",
      "And journalist Fabrizio Romano has claimed that not only is Rashford a popular member of Hansi Flick’s squad, but there is also a possibility that he will remain at the Catalan club beyond this season.",

      "Rashford scored a brace in his side’s 6-1 Champions League win over Olympiacos on Tuesday night. And speaking after the game, he said that the chance to play in El Clasico against Real Madrid this weekend is one of the reasons he made the move to Barcelona in the summer.",
      "\"The Clasico is a great game and that's why I've come here, for this number of games,\" he said. \"I am looking forward to it, I hope we win.\"",
      "While speaking on the Rest is Football podcast with Gary Lineker and Micah Richards back in August, Rashford claimed United are in no man's land. He said: \"You see it with any team that's been successful over a period of time: they have principles that any coach that comes in, any player that comes in, has to align to these principles or be able to add to these principles.",
      "\"Whereas at times I feel like United have just been: we're hungry to win, so we'll always try to adapt and to sign players that fit this system. But it's reactionary.",
      "\"If your direction's always changing, you can't expect to be able to win the league. Yeah, you might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you do have a good coach and you do have good players and you have match winners in your team - you're not there by accident.",

      "Carlos Baleba will get the chance to show Manchester United and Ruben Amorim exactly why they should spend millions to sign him this weekend when Brighton & Hove Albion visit Old Trafford.",
      "The 21-year-old was linked with a move to United in the summer after being identified as the ideal midfielder candidate. Since joining Brighton from Lille, Baleba has become one of the most impressive defensive midfielders in Europe.",
      "After the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United were forced to cool their interest in the Cameroon international due to the £100million price tag asked for. Since then, talk has increased over Baleba's situation at the AMEX Stadium, with reports suggesting he has become unsettled.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has taken Baleba off in three separate Premier League games, fueling speculation over his future. It's understood that United are keeping a close eye on the situation, with a new midfielder the obvious next priority for Amorim when the window reopens.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "On Saturday, Brighton and Baleba travel to Manchester looking to build on their good form. Since losing narrowly to Bournemouth in September, Hurzeler's men have gone five games unbeaten, recording impressive victories over Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "Should Baleba retain his spot in the Brighton midfield, he will have the opportunity to show Amorim and the hierarchy exactly why he should be their subsequent big signing.",
      "All eyes will be on United after recording back-to-back league wins under Amorim for the first time since his appointment. Last week's win over Liverpool followed the victory over Sunderland before the international break, significantly easing the pressure on the United boss.",
      "After replacing Moises Caicedo at Brighton, Baleba is now facing a period of uncertainty. However, concerns over his form since the news of United's interest have resulted in Hurzeler laying down the law with the midfielder.",
      "\"I think we're getting to a time now where it's up to him, where he has to take responsibility as well,\" the Brighton boss said after the win over Newcastle.",
      "\"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton. No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.",
      "\"Now he has to make a step up and show personality, that's his next step in his personal development for sure. Like I said in the last weeks, there are waves in development, but you can only get out of it if you take ownership and if you take the responsibility, there are some moments where nobody can help you.",
      "\"You have to be your own support, your own help. He has the best environment here he can get, he has great team-mates who are there for him and support him.",
      "\"But now it's also up to the player that he steps up, that he shows personality and takes ownership of his development. That's what I demand from him in the future.\"",

      "Stuttgart midfielder Angelo Stiller is a player that Manchester United are monitoring before the January transfer window, according to Fabrizio Romano, despite false reports of a late move this summer.",
      "The 24-year-old was one of many defensive midfielders linked with a switch to Old Trafford this summer. It was widely reported that United were seeking out replacements for Casemiro, whose contract is set to expire at the end of the season.",
      "Carlos Baleba's £100million valuation from Brighton forced United to cool their interest in him, while Sporting CP man Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton were linked. However, Stiller emerged as a late option as the window approached its closure.",
      "It has been reported that Stiller has a release clause in his contract in Germany, though Stuttgart are believed to have the option to buy him out of that clause for £2million. Sky Sport Germany has reported that the Bundesliga outfit will ask for more than £43million when the window opens.",
      "Now, speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano has revealed that no talks have been held between United and Stuttgart just yet, but there is genuine interest held. \"I'm always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller, there was a report from Bild in the last few days on Manchester United tracking the player,\" he said.",
      "\"Manchester United have always been following this player and Angelo Stiller is really appreciated internally. Last summer, we had some stories about Manchester United going on a mission to Germany negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks.",
      "\"No, Manchester United never started any negotiations for Angelo Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility. It was always impossible.",
      "\"Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August, so there was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "\"But Angelo still remains a player monitored by Manchester United. They are following him.",
      "\"They are closely monitoring his progress. Again, at the moment, there's no negotiation, no talks.\"",

      "Gakpo struck the post three times before finding the back of the net. The noise at Anfield increased, sensing the prospect of a late winner, but it was United who scored next to seal an away victory.",
      "Maguire headed brilliantly beyond Giorgi Mamardashvili and received praise from Amorim when the United boss spoke at his post-match press conference. \"It is really important and we have a club that has a lot of pressure,\" said Amorim about the defender's mental strength.",
      "\"It's not easy to play here, but all of them have an opportunity to play for us and then they leave and life is like that. Harry Maguire is really important for us and was today. He is a great example, everything he has been through, a great example of every kid.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim became the first United manager since Louis van Gaal to win at Anfield, and the victory meant he claimed back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time.",
      "Amorim granted additional time off for the players who had been travelling for international duty or trained throughout the break, meaning United had just a few days to prepare with a full squad to face Liverpool.",
      "That didn't prevent United from securing the biggest win of Amorim's tenure at Anfield.",
      "\"To be honest, it's hard, especially when you come from the national team to prepare for a game like this,\" said Dalot after the game. \"You have the full squad for two or three days, no more than that, but the lads who stayed... and the last few days we had were really good.",
      "\"Even the players who were not going to start, you could feel the energy and the positive energy they were giving to those who were going to start, because at any moment they can be important.",
      "\"You saw the substitutes, they came on and they had to help us defend the game and go after the result again. I'm really proud of everyone, the boys and everyone involved.\"",
      "Dalot continued: \"You can imagine the feeling inside the dressing room, it took me eight years to win at Anfield, so obviously really proud of everyone involved, the players, the staff, everybody on the bench. Great feeling, a beautiful day for us and the fans. Everybody has to enjoy today.\"",
      "When asked if it was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",
      "Dalot added: \"It's part of our job [to deal with outside noise], I've been here long enough to understand everyone will have opinions, everyone will have something to say about Man United.",
      "\"You just have to be ready for that. You're playing for the biggest club in the world and you need to be ready to have bad opinions about you, good opinions about yourself.",
      "\"But it's the way you show it, the way you work every day, sometimes, especially this season, we've been doing really good in training at Carrington, but then the results are not coming on.",
      "\"But that's what everybody sees. They don't see what you do every day. So ultimately, they will judge what you do on the pitch on the weekend, and we have to win games, that has to be the mindset.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo couldn't control his emotions when Harry Maguire scored a match-winning goal in Manchester United's win over Liverpool.",
      "It was a tense state of affairs at Anfield on Sunday, as Ruben Amorim's squad faced Arne Slot's Premier League champions in the north west derby. Bryan Mbeumo took the lead for United just two minutes into the fixture, slotting the ball through the legs of Giorgi Mamardashvili from close-range before wheeling off in celebration in front of the Kop.",
      "And while Cody Gakpo snuck in behind enemy lines 78 minutes into the fixture to make it 1-1, fate had other plans that prevented Liverpool from taking a point from the clash. That's because, six minutes later, Maguire sealed the deal for his club with a well-placed header at the back post and that ensured United claimed a hard-earned victory over their fiercest rivals.",
      "While the away crowd naturally erupted with jubilation, United's official social media account captured Amorim's animated reaction to the ball crossing the line. And, in the background, the clip also showed elation from Mainoo, who beamed with joy as he was hoisted up into the air by a member of the Reds' coaching staff.",
      "It came just moments before Mainoo entered the fray as a substitute for Bruno Fernandes, as Amorim looked to hold on to the lead that his side had earned. And that's exactly what United managed to do, repelling a thick and fast Liverpool onslaught which took place for the duration of the eight additional minutes for stoppage time.",
      "United now enjoy a week-long rest before they face Brighton at Old Trafford - with fixtures against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away from home to play before the November international break. Speaking after the win, Amorim said: \"Every day is special, but of course, this was a very special win.",
      "\"To see our fans singing during the game, in one moment, the biggest rival, they are champions on their field, in their stadium. This win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team, because I believe that we can play so much better.",

He primarily focuses on sports content, with specific expertise in and a passion for football, darts, horse racing, snooker, cricket, Formula One, as well as American football.",
      "Manchester United are one of many clubs with a reported interest in Real Madrid's Endrick. The young Brazilian has been dubbed 'the next Ronaldo' but is finding minutes hard to come by at the Bernabeu.",
      "Having been highly thought of in his home country, the youngster penned a deal with Los Blancos in 2022 but only arrived in 2024 once he turned 18 for £52million. He has already made multiple appearances for his senior national side.",
      "Despite holding such promise, Endrick has struggled to breach Xabi Alonso's frontline this season, which is no mean feat considering he is competing against Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior for a spot.",
      "The Sunday People claim that Endrick has informed his representatives that if he does not begin to play in the Spanish capital over the next few months then a January exit is on the cards.",
      "The report names United as an interested party and if a deal, whether it be a loan or a permanent one, is sealed then Endrick could slot into Amorim's centre-forward position.",
      "The 19-year-old is creative enough to drop deeper when needed and allow his forward partners to venture ahead of him and could play a similar role to the one Matheus Cunha adopted against Liverpool.",
      "By not giving Arne Slot's centre-backs a forward to mark closely, as they could have done with potential focal point Benjamin Sesko, United strung Liverpool's defense out with Cunha's versatile positioning. If Endrick does arrive then Sesko could be used in his place when it suits or make an impact off the bench if a more route-one approach is necessary.",
      "Cunha impressed against Liverpool and admitted he is versatile and willing to play wherever he is positioned. Already for United, the £62.5m signing has operated as a centre-forward and a No. 10. In this dream frontline he will drop slightly deep on the right.",
      "Amorim usually plays with Bryan Mbeumo on the right, with Cunha on the left dropping deeper and allowing the other wide forward to almost play alongside a striker.",
      "But in this instance these positions are flipped and a more out-and-out winger who often drifts wide will operate on the left with Cunha in place to the right of fellow Brazilian Endrick. Cunha has played in this position before for Wolves.",
      "Not only will this add a dash of chemistry as Cunha and Endrick have played together for their national side but it also strengthens both flanks. At present, Amad and Mbeumo operate on the right, with either Diogo Dalot or Patrick Dorgu joining Cunha on the left.",
      "If these are flipped we would see Cunha and Amad gel together down one side, which could work better considering Mbeumo and the Ivorian are perhaps too similar. A new superstar winger could then impress on the left, with a more defensive wing-back providing cover.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is one of the Premier League's most inform talents. He has bagged six goals already this term and is lightning down the left wing, which has sparked transfer rumours. It is estimated he could cost upwards of £75m.",
      "United have been one name mentioned should Semenyo leave the Cherries and in this scenario he is recruited to give United a potent threat out left. A front three of Endrick, Cunha and Semenyo allows for more balance across both sides of the pitch.",
      "The more defensive wing-back can back up Semenyo, whereas Amad can feel free to maraud forward with Cunha operating relatively deep. It must be said that ousting Mbeumo from the starting XI after he's impressed since his £65m move from Brentford this summer is rather unthinkable.",
      "But if Semenyo is an option then it's a relative no-brainer that one of the Premier League's finest attacking talents be given a starting spot. Mbeumo could see minutes from the bench much like Sesko and Amorim could adapt his front three for certain fixtures where say a wider threat on the right is more suited.",

      "Slot confusion",
      "With the benefit of hindsight, Ruben Amorim mastered Arne Slot before a ball was even kicked. There were a couple of positions up for grabs heading into the game but few thought that Benjamin Sesko would be dropped.",

      "Two legends",
      "It was a blood-and-thunder atmosphere at Anfield and there was no love lost on the pitch. But in the stands, two club legends managed to move rivalries to one side to enjoy some Chocolate Buttons.",

      "So far, Mbeumo has scored two Premier League goals for United and he was on the scoresheet in Sunday's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The forward latched onto Amad's through ball inside the first minute before beating Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "Cody Gakpo drew the Premier League champions level in the 78th minute before Harry Maguire netted a winner to earn United their first victory at Anfield in nearly 10 years.",

      "The Football Association and Lancashire Police are both looking into claims Hannibal Mejbri spat at Leeds United supporters during his side's 2-0 victory on Saturday. The former Manchester United player - who came on after 83 minutes - is facing up to accusations of spitting following the game at Turf Moor.",
      "A statement from the force read: \"Lancashire Police are aware of an alleged incident involving a Burnley player during the second half of the Premier League game between Burnley and Leeds United at Turf Moor on Saturday 18th October. We are currently working with Burnley Football Club to establish the facts.\"",
      "Burnley have not commented on the matter, while Leeds are aware of the allegations. Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes that if the former United man is found to have spat at Leeds fans, then he will face a minimum suspension of three games from the FA.",
      "\"If charged, Hannibal could receive a suspension which the Football Association will determine, and I think will be at least three matches,\" he told Leeds News.",
      "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis was hit with a five-match stadium ban last year after spitting on the floor as the match officials walked past following his club's 1-0 Premier League defeat to Fulham at the City Ground.",
      "Back in 2003, El Hadji Diouf was found guilty of spitting at a Celtic supporter and was, subsequently, charged with assault. The former forward was fined £5,000 and banned for two European matches by UEFA after pleading guilty in a Scottish court.",
      "And, earlier on this year, Inter Miami striker Luis Suarez was given an additional three-game ban for spitting on a Seattle Sounders staff member. Major League Soccer handed the former Liverpool man the ban after he grabbed Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas before spitting on security director Gene Ramirez.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",
      "Amorim is faced with the same chicken-and-egg scenario with regard to Mount, but without the goals and assists in the team besides to nullify his shocking lack of quantifiable contribution to points on the board for Manchester United.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",

      "Former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown, who remains ‘very well connected within the game’, claims Lammens has “convinced” Amorim that he “deserves to be the first-choice goalkeeper” at Old Trafford.",
      "“Lammens has done everything that’s been asked of him so far,” Brown told Football Insider.",

      "“It’s only been two games, but they’ve been two big games, and you don’t get bigger than winning against Liverpool away from home, so he’s got some bottle as well.",
      "“The confidence he shows rubs off on the other players as well. I think he’s done a fantastic job, and from Man United’s point of view, they are very pleased.",
      "“It looks to me like he’s solved what has been a massive problem for Man United in recent years.",
      "“By all accounts, he’s won over the manager and convinced him he deserves to be the first-choice goalkeeper, so it looks like he will remain in goal now. That then means they don’t have to scramble around looking for a new goalkeeper in the transfer market like they had planned to do, and can focus elsewhere instead.”",
      "The summer exit of Rashford raised funds and enabled Man Utd to sign Lammens and others, though the England international has been in stunning form for Barcelona this season.",

      "“His desire to be a Barcelona player is there since January 2025. Almost one year ago, in the January window, it was not possible to make the deal happen because Barcelona didn’t have the space to register and sign Rashford because Ansu Fati didn’t want to leave the club in January.",
      "“Then in the summer, Ansu Fati accepted the possibility to leave Barcelona, went to Monaco, Barcelona had the space to sign Rashford and they completed the transfer on a loan deal with a €30 million buy option clause.",
      "“Now, Rashford is performing in a fantastic way, already reaching 10 goal contributions between goals and assists, doing very well also in the Champions League, can play as a striker, can play as a winger. You can feel how comfortable Rashford is at Barcelona.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has reportedly held ‘private talks’ with Brighton over his future, while Fabrizio Romano has provided an update.",
      "In recent seasons, Baleba has emerged as one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League and he attracted interest from Man Utd in the summer.",
      "The Red Devils are crying out for a quality No.6 and they made an audacious move for Baleba in the summer, though they were priced out of a move as Brighton demanded around £100m for his services.",
      "Still, a transfer remains possible heading into 2026, though Baleba’s form has declined in the opening couple of months of this season.",
      "Baleba appears to have been impacted by the ongoing transfer speculation, though The Sun have revealed that a knee issue is also behind his below-par performances.",
      "The outlet has also pointed out that Baleba has held ‘private talks’ with Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler, with it noted that he has ‘reassured’ the manager ‘of his commitment to the club’ as Man Utd ‘continue to monitor his situation closely’.",
      "Romano has also provided an update on Baleba, as Man Utd “internally” sees VfB Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller as a potential alternative.",
      "“I’m always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller. There was a report from Bild in the last few days on Man Utd tracking the player. Man Utd have always been following this player. Stiller is really appreciated internally at Man Utd,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Mikel Arteta only third in Premier League manager rankings for 25/26",
      "“Last summer, we had some stories on Man Utd going on a mission to Germany, negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks. No, Man Utd never started any negotiations for Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility, it was always impossible.",
      "“Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August. There was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "“But Stiller remains a player monitored by Man Utd. They are following him. They are closely monitoring his progress.”",
      "Romano has also made it clear that Amorim “wants an important midfielder in 2026”, while he has made it clear that Baleba cannot be forgotten in this situation.",
      "“Again, at the moment, there is no negotiation, no talks. But Ruben Amorim wants an important midfielder for Man Utd in 2026. We will see whether it’s going to be January, if it’s possible, or a summer transfer window. Stiller is one of the players being monitored,” Romano added.",
      "“Don’t forget about [Carlos] Baleba, don’t forget about other profiles. Man Utd are tracking midfielders. Stiller is an interesting player for Man Utd.",
      "“Stiller is a very respectful player, German, so he didn’t want to create any problem with Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, and he’s never going to be that kind of player, forcing moves, creating problems.",
      "“That’s not the attitude of Stiller. He’s a very serious guy, in a very good relationship with everyone at Stuttgart. At the moment, we are not at the stage where we have to mention a negotiation, a discussion.",
      "“There are several clubs keeping a close eye on him because he’s a very interesting one, very good player with potential to become even better.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has provided a new update on Marc Guehi’s situation at Crystal Palace as Liverpool ‘remain attentive’ to his situation.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Man Utd forward Bryan Mbeumo is attempting to convince Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "Man Utd have bumped Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton above Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in their list of midfield targets, according to reports."

      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "We typically air the views of former Red Devils full-back Paul Parker because their bizarre, controversial nature offers at worst the opportunity for a smile or a chuckle of a weekday.",
      "Those that are too bonkers for publication we typically ignore and brush off as the witterings of someone who might ordinarily scrawl their opinions on a toilet cubicle door.",
      "But we couldn’t help but be provoked by his latest views on Rashford, whom he’s never been shy in giving his two pennies’ worth on.",
      "“He let his team-mates down. He was lazy, he didn’t do anything. He’s got a lot to prove if he comes back to England. How many players in the UK would trust him if he played for their team? We know it, the answer is no-one. They would never say it, but they would be feeling it inside. It was life and death when I played, and that should have been inbuilt in him, but it isn’t.”",
      "Rashford can’t win. Either he doesn’t do well for Barcelona to prove he was never all that anyway. Or he does do well and that apparently shows just how “lazy” he must have been for United. And what about this assertion that “no-one would trust him”.",
      "That certainly didn’t seem to be the case at Aston Villa in the second half of last season, or indeed for England now. We would actually suggest that the Rashford currently slamming in goals and notching assists for Barcelona is the sort of of guy most “players in the UK” would turn to in order to get them out of a bind.",
      "As is the case with Roy Keane, Gary Neville and other former Manchester United players, Parker is struggling to come to terms with his former club being the problem, rather than Rashford and the many other players who have moved on and are thriving elsewhere. Not that he is actually thriving…",
      "“He has done alright, but I don’t think he is in Barcelona’s ideal starting 11. Will he start in a Champions League final with Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski? I think the answer is no. He doesn’t start. Everything about Marcus Rashford seems to be about politics, to be honest.”",
      "Using the guys who came second and fifth in the Ballon d’Or and arguably the greatest goalscorer of his generation as the yardstick to show Rashford isn’t actually doing that well shows just how few straws Parker has to grasp in that particular argument. And what’s that “politics” bit about? Still annoyed about feeding starving children? He’s got four goals and two assists in three Champions League games by ‘focusing on his football’.",
      "“Rashford put himself in a bad position where he didn’t know what to do. If you can’t give everything for your boyhood club and you are willing to let down the rest of the team, then that says a lot about you. If you can’t do it at the club you have been at since you were a kid, even saying you support that team and love the city where you have been brought up. If you can’t deliver for them and let your teammates down on numerous occasions, then you are in a very bad position.”",
      "It’s a “bad position” which now sees him playing and enjoying his football at one of the most famous and best clubs in Europe. He’s probably alright.",
      "“Then he went to Aston Villa and the media claimed he did well, but did he do better than Ollie Watkins? No. Did he do any better than Jacob Ramsey? No. But he was sold that way because the narrative was to put pressure on Man Utd.”",
      "We don’t think comparing Rashford with other very good footballers is making quite the point that Parker is aiming at, and Unai Emery often selected him ahead of Watkins. In both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, for example.",
      "Here’s to Rashford rattling in a hat-trick for Barcelona in his first El Classico on Sunday and Parker again being asked for his thoughts on his dramatic resurgence. He’ll find some new stick to beat him with, and if not, his brilliance for his new club will only strengthen his claim that Rashford was “lazy” at Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford scored his second Champions League brace of the season against Olympiacos. The Man Utd loanee is loving life at Barcelona.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror."

      "Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’ and could become a transfer target for West Ham in January, according to reports.",
      "Zirkzee joined Man Utd from Bologna for around £37million in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "Despite joining with huge potential after costing more than his £34m release clause, the Netherlands international has struggled to adapt to Premier League football.",
      "He played 49 times across all competitions for the Red Devils in 2024/25, registering seven goals and three assists.",
      "One of Zirkzee’s biggest problems is where he fits on the pitch. Nobody seems to know what his best position is, and there appears to be no place for him in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "There was potential for Zirkzee to thrive as one of Amorim’s ‘wide 10s’, but so far this season, he’s only made four appearances and is yet to start a match.",
      "Amorim clearly doesn’t rate him, with new signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko comfortably ahead in the attacking pecking order.",
      "Mason Mount has also been preferred in attack this season and started away to Liverpool on Sunday, while Zirkzee was an unused substitute for the fifth time in the Premier League this campaign.",
      "Considering that Zirkzee has been in every matchday squad this season, Amorim might be reluctant to lose the attacking depth he provides, but you can’t blame the player if he wants to leave the club.",
      "The 24-year-old has been linked with a return to Italy pretty much ever since he joined Man Utd, and that is still an option for him.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham could make Zirkzee a target in January as new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo wants at least three new signings when the transfer window reopens, according to talkSPORT.",
      "Indeed, the report states that Nuno is demanding a new striker be signed in the winter window, with Zirkzee a ‘potential option’.",
      "It’s claimed that Zirkzee is ‘desperate to leave Old Trafford’, with AS Roma one of several Serie A clubs interested in the ex-Bologna striker.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has made it clear to the West Ham hierarchy that he needs at least three new signings in January, including a striker.",
      "One potential option is Manchester United outcast Joshua Zirkzee, who is desperate to leave Old Trafford.",
      "West Ham would face competition for Zirkzee from clubs in Italy, including Roma, who would consider terminating misfiring Evan Ferguson’s loan from Brighton to bring in a replacement.",
      "Nuno would prefer a target-man in the Chris Wood and Raul Jimenez ilk.",
      "You really can’t blame Zirkzee if he is ‘desperate to leave’ the Red Devils.",
      "He’s only 24 and has proved at Bologna that he can be a top player. Furthermore, it’s a World Cup year and he needs to be playing if Ronald Koeman is to consider selecting him.",
      "A return to Italy should do the trick for Zirkzee, who is yet to prove he can fulfill his potential playing in England.",
      "From what he has shown so far, Zirkzee doesn’t look up to the pace of the Premier League and his game is not well-suited to the competition.",
      "Serie A is perfect for him and if there’s any chance of him making the Netherlands’ World Cup squad, he should return to Italy in January.",
      "This XI, featuring the past, present and future of Arsenal highlights once more the Gunners’ strength in depth…",
      "The agent of Joshua Zirkzee has been criticised for taking his client to Man Utd after the Premier League club has “become a cesspool”.",

      "Mate. Just…mate. Possibly the worst managerial reign in the entire history of the Premier League, and that is some shout. It’s certainly the shortest.",
      "Look, we sort of get it, we do. We get why he took the job. He probably did need to move fast to get back in the Premier League, try and convince someone to take a punt on him while those memories of Europa League glory were fresh enough in everyone’s minds to stop them thinking too long or too hard about the sheer ridiculousness of taking Spurs to 17th in the league.",
      "It’s asking a huge amount to say Postecoglou should have turned down a job that got him straight back into the European competition where he’d just had such spectacular success.",
      "But…he should have turned down that job. Obviously he should. It went wrong in all the ways everyone knew it would go wrong, except at about five times the pace. There were, even among those truly cataclysmically awful results, flashes of what makes Angeball so beguiling. There were some lovely moves and stunning goals.",
      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",

It is only five months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",

      "Greater reasons for positivity can be found in the Champions League, mind, where they were only undone in a good game by a couple of moments of Marcus Rashford magic, before making a full mockery of their Premier League inconsistency by being very consistent indeed and winning their next two games in the competition 4-0 and 3-0.",
      "The weekend’s game against Fulham feels really quite hefty for early season perceptions. Whoever wins is safely back among the mid-table peloton. Whoever loses is down among the stragglers and the strugglers.",

      "We feared for him, we really did. Villa’s much-discussed fondness for sailing close to the PSR wind and boasting wildly unsustainable wage-to-turnover ratios makes them the very last club that could afford – in sporting and financial senses – to miss out on Champions League football as cruelly as they did at the back end of last season.",
      "It definitely leaked into this campaign, but there is now some pretty solid evidence that they have escaped from the funk, and burgling a first away league win of the season at sleepy Spurs cements it. After five winless games had you wondering whether the quite brilliant Emery revolution at Villa might be coming to a swift and sticky end, they’ve now won five games in a row with that number likely to be six after this week’s Europa League trip to Go Ahead Eagles.",
      "Never underestimate the power of the Europa League to influence the early-season mood of its competitor clubs for both good or ill. The (relative) ease and (relative) lack of pressure on those games can do all sorts of wondrous things to free players and managers up and get a season up and running, and there’s no doubt it has massively helped Villa already.",
      "Or, of course, you can be Nottingham Forest. Which is not the recommended approach.",
      "The Europa League also presents Villa with a wonderful opportunity to end what is now, after last season’s successes for Newcastle and Spurs, comfortably the silliest ongoing trophy drought in English football.",
      "",
      "Flawless mid-table behaviour from Brighton so far. In the space of just eight games this season they’ve already beaten three of last season’s top five in Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle.",
      "And where has this got them? Tenth. It’s got them to tenth.",
      "Now sure, it’s a congested mid-table area where they are also only three points behind third, but that only adds to the fun of it, along with the fact those three wins against last season’s top five are in fact Brighton’s only wins this season.",
      "Which also means, in a weird way, that if Manchester United really are back, back, back, then the absolute best way for them to prove it is to lose at home to the Seagulls this weekend.",
      "",
      "Could there be a more perfect job at a more perfect time for the great anti-woke firefighter?",
      "There are two perfect scenarios for Dyche to come in to a club and unleash his Brexitball. Either a club that is thoroughly aware of its limitations, or one paying the ultimate price for being entirely unaware of them.",
      "Nottingham Forest and their main-character owner deluded themselves into the deeply dangerous belief that one thoroughly competent season playing rigidly defined and expertly trained counter-attacking football in a season when so many big teams were just awful had elevated them into the elite.",
      "That they were now a club that could dare to dream big and face no consequences should the heat of the Barclays sun prove too much for their new and hastily glued wings.",
      "They have now discovered that was very much not the case.",
      "You only appoint Ange Postecoglou, with his recent Premier League record of just losing almost all of the games all of the time, if you have kidded yourself relegation is not something you have to think about.",
      "And you only appoint Dyche if you’ve realised that relegation is now the only thing you have to think about.",
      "Forest are the most perfect example of the second kind of Dyche club we can possibly imagine. As such, it is actually a very decent appointment. It’s a smaller, quieter, chastened Forest that Dyche enters than the one Nuno left just a few short weeks ago, but one that is therefore more malleable. More open to what must be done.",
      "You will have gruel-and-gravel Brexitball, and you will enjoy it. Or at least accept and appreciate its necessity.",
      "The other thing that’s just great for Dyche is that it should absolutely work a treat too. In the round, Forest have bollocksed this up. Dyche is not as good a manager as Nuno. He is even less subtle in his methods. He is a downgrade from the manager Forest had at the start of the season, but he is of the same school.",
      "And thus a much better fit than his immediate predecessor for the profile of squad he will inherit. Because it really is a very good squad indeed, and one that absolutely need not be in any of the sort of strife in which it finds itself.",
      "The low-block-and-counter might not be quite so effective for Dyche this season as it was for Nuno last, but it should be plenty effective enough to quickly steer Forest away from their current self-inflicted Angeball-delusion relegation fight.",
      "Dyche will get Forest organised and efficient once more. He will prioritise what they are good at, which we already know thoroughly aligns with what he wants his teams to be good at. We saw it work time and again last season, and it will work time and again this.",
      "We are beyond confident that Chris Wood goals in p*ss-boiling xG-spiting draws and wins will once again soon become the norm at the City Ground.",
      "Forest will once again return to being one of the hardest teams to play against instead of the softest and easiest.",
      "This is a club that has taken its medicine and should feel the benefit, but it is Dyche who emerges the clear winner here. He won’t be able to keep the smile off his disc-bearded face.",
      "He has everything he could possibly want. A squad of very good players who are perfectly suited to playing his specific brand of football to an extremely high level, yet at a club where the humblings of recent months mean there will not be any quickly declared desire for anything more.",
      "This is a club that got high on the smell of its own farts and is now choking. They don’t need crisp, crystal-clear filtered air to breathe. They just need something that isn’t their own farts.",
      "",
      "Not sure what we make of Chelsea. They have been, at times this season, almost unforgivably stupid and it’s always hard to imagine that kind of thing doesn’t come in some way or another from the manager. The Manchester United game was incredibly stupid.",
      "They were quite stupid against Forest as well, albeit that in the end they couldn’t quite compete with Forest’s stratospheric levels. Few could, which was why Ange Postecoglou had to go just to try and make it fair on other teams who wanted to try and be stupid.",
      "Hats off to Malo Gusto, mind, for never losing belief that Chelsea could still emerge as the most stupid on the day long after that ship had sailed.",
      "Enzo Maresca has been Chelsea boss for over a year now, which is no mean achievement in its own right. He’s taken them to the Champions League, won the Europa Carabao and been crowned quite literal champion of the world at the Trump World Cup.",
      "And yet when we ask ourselves the most simple and straightforward questions – Is Maresca actually good? Are Chelsea? – we still find that we really don’t know. Which we suppose is kind of inevitable when you stop running a football club as a football club.",
      "",
      "‘Outside the bottom three after eight games’ is surely a position Parker and Burnley would have taken before a ball was kicked, especially given the nature of those eight games.",
      "In fact, given Parker’s previous record in this competition and the fact those first eight league games have included Tottenham, Man United, Liverpool, Man City and Aston Villa, he’d have probably settled for just still being in a job at this point. As it is, he’s barely even an also-ran in the Sack Race at this point.",
      "Burnley have duly lost all five of those games mentioned above, but only at Spurs on the opening day and City last month have they been conspicuously second best. Both Man United and Liverpool needed late, late penalties to beat them, and Villa were given a late scare at Villa Park.",
      "What Burnley have done so far is secure points against their more direct rivals. They’ve already beaten both their fellow promoted clubs and taken a point off Nottingham Forest that at this time we really don’t know is any good or not.",
      "At some point Parker and his team really will have to work out a way to beat teams that were already in the Premier League before this year, but in fairness he hasn’t had many good chances. Games against Wolves and West Ham before the international break are definitely good chances. Arsenal perhaps not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But what we do sense at Spurs is a vital and widespread uncertainty. A distinct lack of purpose. We don’t know what the goal is for Spurs this season after finally sorting out the silverware albatross. And we’re not too sure they – or Frank – really know either.",
      "This is a new team and new manager trying to build a relationship with each other and the fans, for whom the last major tie with the ups and downs of the eventful last decade has been severed with the departure of Son Heung-min.",
      "Spurs are a club now in search of new heroes and favourites, on the pitch and in the dugout, and it all just feels a bit directionless. Frank is a good coach, obviously, and there have been enough signs that in the right – and often that appears to be the most theoretically taxing – conditions his Spurs team could also be very good indeed.",
      "But they can also be thoroughly apathetic and entirely maddening. One could thus argue, if one were so inclined, that this is in fact already far more Spurs than has perhaps yet been realised.",
      "",
      "Has got Jack Grealish officially Enjoying His Football Again and we should all be delighted to observe it.",
      "It’s all going well enough right now, but Everton are one of several clubs in the big mid-table hump for whom this still feels very much like a season that could break in either direction as they sit four points away from both third and 17th.",
      "",
      "For varied and obvious and entirely understandable reasons, the Premier League manager discourse is currently dominated by a few names. Your Slots, Your Artetas, Your Amorims. The Sean Dyches of this world.",
      "But it occurs to us that there is currently very little being said about Pep Guardiola, and we find that quite interesting.",
      "Because this is a pretty crucial juncture in the Premier League career of one of Our League’s greatest managers. And we think he might just be starting to enjoy himself again.",
      "We’re pretty sure he didn’t really enjoy last season very much. You could see it on his face, sometimes viscerally and literally. A man used to competing for – and very often winning – the very biggest trophies was suddenly not doing that.",
      "Man City’s bids for a fifth straight Premier League crown and a second Champions League title were barely perceptible. The former disappeared in an astonishingly miserable run of form last autumn, one that also caused damage to the latter that proved to be unrecoverable.",
      "We spent a lot of last season wondering whether he might in fact walk away from City altogether, whether he any longer had the energy or desire to keep pushing himself and his players to go again in pursuit of yet more tin.",
      "Having watched his great rival Jurgen Klopp walk away from Liverpool due to possessing sufficient self-awareness and self-knowledge to know he just didn’t have another rebuild in him, would Guardiola be thinking in anything like the same way? We’re certain the thought at least crossed his mind, especially with Klopp clearly very much enjoying his less intensely and demandingly stressful Red Bull role so much.",
      "And despite his new contract, those thoughts resurfaced when City made a stuttering start this season, with consecutive and quite alarmingly tame early defeats to Spurs and Brighton hinting at another season in transition, a season building the foundations for something new rather than competing at the very top level.",
      "Could Guardiola really be arsed with all that? Building a new team to one day go against Arne Slot seemingly finding the Premier League embarrassingly easy, or whatever phase Arteta Arsenal are now in? What about right now?",
      "That’s all shifted a bit, though. City have been very good since the Brighton game and, with Liverpool/Slot losing the entire run of themselves over recent weeks it is once again Guardiola and his side who have emerged from the chaos looking the likelier challengers for a currently dominant Arsenal.",
      "And we know that going up against his old mate Mikel Arteta enlivens and energises Guardiola. It might just do so again. And we also don’t have to worry about just how much of an achievement Guardiola would consider it were City able to come out on top once again in that particular title battle.",
      "This new slightly more direct Haaland-centric, post-De Bruyne City shows tantalising signs of capturing Guardiola’s imagination in a way nothing really did last season.",
      "When you’ve achieved what Guardiola has achieved it must be unbelievably hard to keep coming back and putting yourself through it all again.",
      "This season suddenly looks to be playing out in just the way to get his blood up. The combination of the revitalising change in his own team’s methods and the familiarity of their direct rival might just be ideal.",
      "",
      "Still represents one of the most astonishing gambles a Premier League club has ever taken, the continuity candidate at a club that no longer had any of that, but three wins from the first eight games for a rookie manager suddenly in charge of a team that has lost its inspirational manager, most of his backroom staff, and players of the calibre of Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard is absolutely fine.",
      "They’re still scoring goals, which was the main worry. If Igor Thiago keeps up his current rate, Brentford will be fine. They’re the leading scorers in the bottom half of the table, and that’s a fair effort when you consider the resources Andrews has available and those he does not.",
      "There are lots of managers doing exceptional things at the Premier League’s smaller clubs, for want of a better word, but if Andrews negotiates this season keeping Brentford as far clear of the trapdoor as is currently the case, it will be as impressive as any of them.",
      "",
      "Feels like we could be just days away from the backlash. For when you have had your balls tickled and been told how brilliant you are as much and for as long as Glasner has, a backlash there must be.",
      "Very obviously an excellent manager, very obviously taking Palace to heights they really haven’t ever scaled before. But is there now, slightly awkwardly, just the slightest argument to be made they’re not doing quite as well this season as perhaps they ought?",
      "They’ve got the same number of Premier League wins as Brentford. They sit behind Sunderland in the table. We’re being very, very harsh here, but it feels like Glasner has done such things at Palace now that neither he nor they should be truly happy with sitting eighth in the table behind some conspicuously daft teams. They’re even being outperformed by Bournemouth as the division’s standout ‘punching above their weight with elite manager’ club.",
      "",
      "Mikel Arteta has now turned Arsenal into just about the least interesting team in the country, and this is almost entirely a compliment.",
      "They are now just exceptionally good at what they do, and it has provided them with a far more plausible, sustainable and coherent route to title success than previous Arteta phases have possessed and, even more importantly, than any of their potential (and largely wilting) rivals can lay claim to this season.",
      "The fact that Arsenal’s set-piece goals boil enough p*ss to solve the energy crisis is just a bonus.",
      "Because it’s Arsenal and because it’s Arteta, we still kind of expect a massive meltdown around January/February, with an FA Cup exit combined with a three-game winless Premier League run plunging them into a headloss crisis in which dark conspiracies are invoked and from which no recovery is possible.",
      "But that’s a triumph of experience over hope. This Arsenal side looks and feels different to Arteta’s previous efforts. Just their last three Premier League games provide compelling evidence of that. They’ve won at Newcastle and Fulham, while easing to a home win over West Ham.",
      "It might not seem too startling, until you consider that Arsenal contrived to collect but a single point from the same three games last season.",
      "They’re not even incurring as much wrath from the celebration police these days. This really should be the season they finally get over the line, at which point it probably will be a smart idea for everyone else to just switch off the internet for a month or so until the World Cup.",
      "READ: Arsenal are ‘boring’ and rely on set-pieces? Nope, they’re just really, really good",
      "",
      "Hands up who thought he and his team would be doing this well, with nary a thought of relegation or prominent Sack Race involvement to be seen?",
      "Put them down, you ridiculous liar.",
      "He’s been brilliant, they’ve been brilliant. And what Le Bris and Sunderland have done in these first eight games is in no small part responsible for the absolute panic currently going off at clubs around the league.",
      "The fact none of the promoted teams this year appear willing to meekly accept their designated role as cannon fodder is making several members of the Settled Seventeen nervous in a way they haven’t been in the last two seasons, but Sunderland are the main reason there are so many arses currently twitching so violently at your Wolveses, Forests and West Hams, and why even the Fulhams of this world no longer appear immune.",
      "",
      "He’s not just doing a good job. He’s doing one so good that we genuinely suspect it might actually be witchcraft. How, for instance, does a team of Bournemouth’s resources lose, in the space of one summer, defensive players of the calibre of Ilya Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez – not to mention their first-choice goalkeeper – and not just carry on regardless but actively improve?",
      "Something’s not right here. If anything for me, Clive, Iraola’s almost managing Bournemouth too well.",
      "We really are no more than two minor Arsenal setbacks away from asking whether Bournemouth can Do A Leicester in what we’re already confident Barclays scholars will come to consider the stupidest season since all the nonsense of 2015/16. Although last season is also right up there, now we think about it. This is the age of nonsense.",
      "But at Bournemouth, it is only the good kind of nonsense.",
      "Tell you what you don’t hear much of these days. People saying it’s an absolute disgrace for Bournemouth to have replaced Gary O’Neil with Iraola. That kind of chatter was all the rage for a while back there.",
      "It’s been six years for Arsenal so they are way down this list, but it does feel ridiculous. But not as ridiculous a trophy drought as some…",
      "Arne Slot might want to consider that other managers can play against Liverpool as they wish; it’s his job to coach against that.",
      "Florian Wirtz is fuming, furious and raging at Mo Salah, who would get humiliated by Jurgen Klopp for posting a family photo.",
      "As soon as Ousmane Dembele was awarded the 2025 Ballon d’Or, the speculation began about the 2026 iteration.",
      "Arsenal reaching that final phase under Mikel Arteta was never going to be proven by Gary Neville’s metrics. The key was always incremental improvements.",

      "That means Rashford now has the most goal involvements in the competition in 2025/26. Only Julian Alvarez (10) and Kylian Mbappe (17) have more contributions across all competitions of La Liga players this term — Rashford has nine.",
      "He’s also been involved in goals in eight of his last nine appearances for the Blaugrana.",
      "Rashford is a player revitalised, thriving in a system that suits him perfectly.",
      "He led the line against Olympiacos but has mostly featured from the left, and proving himself in both positions is a major boost for both him and Flick.",
      "His resurgence isn’t just good news for Barca, Flick and the player himself — it’s also a positive for Manchester United and England.",
      "While Rashford is showing he’s a player United could still use, that chapter looks closed. If he somehow stops scoring now, Barca probably won’t trigger the £26million buy option. But if he keeps this up, they’ll activate it the second it becomes available.",
      "Both his goals against Olympiacos were fired in at the front post, leaving Konstantinos Tzolakis rooted to his line — instinctive, clinical, and vintage Rashford.",

      "READ NEXT: Barcelona want to ‘send Rashford home’ to Man Utd? Of course they do…",
      "According to reports, there has been a ‘huge transfer U-turn’ at Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Marcus Rashford got another couple of goals and an assist for Barcelona on Tuesday, and for some that serves as proof he was “lazy” at Man Utd. He can’t win.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is behind just two players for Premier League goals against the Big Six for Manchester United, and should get enough penalties to catch them.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "Keane, Rooney and Neville all believe Rashford should look in the mirror before criticising Manchester United, but his Manchester United was theirs in name only.",
      "Rooney say Rashford blaming Man Utd for his “inconsistent” displays is an “easy” excuse and told the England international to look in the mirror."

      "“I have to say, within a minute, that had gone because it was a brilliant moment for United, a really good bit of play from Amad [Diallo], slipping it into [Bryan] Mbeumo. And that just got them off on the right footing.”",
      "A look at the stats of the game suggests there was indeed reason for Neville and others to be cautious.",
      "Liverpool had more shots, more on target and much more of the ball. However, United sat back and played the ball long to get themselves out of trouble and transition from defence to attack.",

I’m obviously delighted that United took advantage and got a win, but I don’t actually think they had to put on a storming display to manage that. It was a 7/10 from United – some good, some not so good. A more confident/capable team probably goes for the throat at 1-0 up and goes in at half-time 2 or 3 goals to the good.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "That said, it was nice to see a game plan in place from Amorim and a disciplined performance from the United players. Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens have been immediate upgrades on the dross they’ve replaced, and the performances across the board do feel slightly boosted from last season (not hard, but still). There’s a bit of spirit in the team – Sesko seemed genuinely delighted with the winner and the result, instead of sulking like the Rashfords and Sanchos of this world when he was benched. Those small differences can add up over time, and it’s much easier to get behind a team that looks to have a healthy quota of good eggs (special mention to De Ligt in that sense).",
      "But going back to the aforementioned negative inklings re: Liverpool, I thought the following were pretty indisputable:",
      "All the above borne in mind, I’d be starting to look at Slot too. He obviously has tonnes of credit in the bank, but that summer splurge looks misdirected at this stage and his excuses after the game were limp. Moaning about low blocks and long passes out to bypass the press is facile – you have to expect those things when you’re champions and playing at home. Not having any solution bar “chuck all the attackers on and pile forward” debunks a lot of the praise he got for his tactical flexibility last season. They did have chances to score more, but so did United. If you turn football into basketball, you’re playing with fire.",
      "Finally, it’s heartening to see the narrative for this season having flipped so dramatically in a month. From “mark of champions, league is done” when the issues were already clear and Liverpool were getting away with it, all the way to “deepening crisis, huge opening for Arsenal/City” in the space of 4 weeks that even included an international break. The truth is somewhere in the middle obviously, but seeing the usual early season knee-jerks being swiftly corrected is nice. Hopefully the remainder of the season provides as much intrigue.\nKeith Reilly",

      "",
      "…Can those defending Slot not admit Liverpool are still 4th despite him, not because of him? The majority of wins were the result of individual brilliance, and nothing to do with his tactics or game plan. One half of decent football from 10 games is damning. The man has persisted with Salah, Mac Allister and Virgil/Konate (delete as applicable) when they’ve repeatedly stunk the place out, and made Szoboszlai at RB a thing, when you have two actual defenders in Gomez and Frimpong sat on the bench.",
      "He also lacks ‘de bolls’ to drop Salah and play both Ekitike and Isak. I don’t subscribe to the view that Liverpool spent £400m to bolster their squad, as they’ve a net loss on players after the transfer window. However, £200m was spent on two strikers who were supposed to be an improvement on what was already there. Yet here we are, with Salah being completely anonymous for 90 minutes yet again, and Gakpo missing more than he scores.",
      "Finally, post-game interviews have become a cringe-fest. Bemoaning the other teams’ tactics (case in point yesterday “they only played long balls”) after yet another poor performance is an embarrassment. Last season’s easy-going and honest (Dutch?) vibe has been replaced with snide and derogatory remarks about opponents, win, lose or draw. There’s obviously massive pressure on Slot, but a bit of self-awareness is needed.\nDF",

Players need to settle and get to know each other and fully understand what the manager wants. The team has changed a lot since the last year.

Grav was super and bombed forward to great effect, but given the way we are currently set up we absolutely need someone sitting in that position in front of the back 4, and he’s the best person to do it. Having our 6 charging forward to join attacks is all well and good, but it’s leaving us far too open.",

The collective expectations of Liverpool this season have been massively overblown, the steep decline we are seeing was always far more likely – it’s the logical outcome of human beings being forced to work in a high pressure environment during a mental health crisis.",
      "I watched the Chelsea game back before the United one, and was struck not just by how every single Pool player was making basic mistakes that are normally coached out of players at school, but that the reaction to each and every snafu was the same vacant lost expression and resignation that nothing better could be expected. There didn’t seem to be any fight, nor fire in the belly to do themselves justice. It was the same yesterday – when Mo’s toe-punting it six feet past the upright and Gakpo’s heading it even further wide, both in the six yard box, the reactions were more performative than passionate. Mo normally smiles, knowing a goal is coming soon, especially against United – this time, a look to the heavens, almost close to tears.",
      "Slot’s completely lost his composure too – the analysis is spot on – he went full cuptard when there was plenty of the game to go. Previously, we would go a goal down and the reaction would be to step up the focus and intensity and eventually overpower and owerwhelm pretty much every opponent we faced. Now we shit the bed at the first sign of adversity, throw everybody forward and start finger-pointing and arm-waving that it is everybody’s fault but our own. No accountability, no sacrifice, no collective, no team. Slot’s deployment of the new signings has neutered them completely, while simultaneously making the established players demonstrably worse. Slot’s not waving, but drowning unfortunately.",

      "It’s got to be Jota. Football is a team game, the best teams win trophies, to get the best teams you need closeness and intimacy (fnarr) – absolute trust in the people you are in the trenches with, you have to do anything for the person next to you for mutual success – it should come as naturally as breathing. It’s more of a band of brothers than colleagues – everybody intensely focussed on the same goals, and the collective euphoria that follows achieving them. United looked like more of a team yesterday – more focussed, more together. Liverpool looked like they didn’t really want to be there, engulfed by triggers of tragic loss.",
      "Liverpool are reminded constantly of Jota’s passing – the space in the dressing room, the chant every 20 minutes of every game. Liverpool’s non-cunt (before this summer anyway) recruitment policy has resulted in a squad especially vulnerable to this situation. They are being forced out into the spotlight multiple times a week while they are still trying to process the loss of a friend, almost brother. The new players are trying to forge relationships with damaged human beings – it’s not easy. Losing a friend too soon (RIP Joycey, sorry you missed Spurs actually winning something) stays with you always – initially you are thinking about them, about what happened, constantly. Over time you think about them less, but it’s always there, like a cold blanket enveloping you or a dark undercurrent trying to pull you down. Imagine taking that with you onto the pitch under the bright lights and intense scrutiny, everybody expecting, no demanding you deliver, and abusing you when you just can’t.",
      "This isn’t an excuse, nor a plea for sympathy, but it does explain why the formerly faultless have reached a new nadir – why players can’t play a pass or shoot straight, why Slot can’t select the right players or make the right subs or pick the right tactics – they are all in a PTSD storm with no way out until the summer.",
      "So Liverpool won’t win anything this season, they were never going to – this season is all about repairing mental health, rebuilding confidence and trying to find some affinity with each other. It’s a real shame that Slot and the Big Virg won’t admit this publicly, as that would start the healing process, but I guess it must be impossible to do that in the macho football microcosm.\nGofezo (or maybe it is just because Slot looks exactly like a human glans)",

      "So Spurs lost on Sunday, to Aston Villa. For the third time in three games in 2025 as it happens, and for the sixth time in 8 games since Steven Gerrard left. A period where Thomas Frank has now lost 5 times and drawn twice in 7 games against Villa. And in which Villa have finished the season above the world’s most Ridiculously Entitled Football Club 3 times out of 3 (including last season obviously, when everyone else finished above REFC too).",
      "So maybe the media build-up to the game may have focused on what Spurs were going to have to focus on doing to beat an opponent they often struggle against? Maybe the commentary during the game would have suggested that the Daniel Levy Thunderdome Conference Centre ™ might have posh toilets but it is not actually a good place to play football; and if REFC concentrate on what the opposition can do, they might have more chance? Possibly the coverage after the game could have recognised that rather than going overboard on Spurs being sloppy and some amazing God from the machine moments from Villa, there could have been a glimmer of recognition that Villa are… just better?",
      "But no. Because of course, any of this would require club and media to get over themselves. When Conte and Mourinho and even Ange – Ange Postecoglou! – were explaining to the world that there is an attitude problem at James Maddison Football Club, did anyone listen? When Rio Ferdinand was banging on about Djed Spence – Djed Spence! – being the best one-on-one defender in England, we probably should have all been running to the bookmakers to put the house on Spurs conceding goals from the Spence zone. But will this be forgotten by the next time the England squad is announced? You bet it will. A Spurs player puts his shirt on the right way round and suddenly a star is born.",
      "Being ‘Spursy’ is not a thing. ‘Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory’ is not unique to Tottenham at all. Clubs good enough to win frequently, without access to the final 0.1% of quality to keep getting over the line regularly enough to be the best, are all in this position. What is unique to Tottenham is a colossal ego with absolutely nothing to back it up. But the results they get are normal. The performances and outcomes are all normal. If they attract new signings to the club because of the allure of London, they should not be surprised to have a lot of ‘injuries’. They are not cursed. There is no spell preventing the club from becoming Liverpool. Pretending they’re driving an F1 car when playing Mariokart will not result in success.",

The last time I went to that pub was 5 April, the day Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite being reduced to nine men. What odds that our next visit will end up being 14 March, the day Palace host Leeds United? That seems to have good madness potential.",
      "* As plenty of us have said before, there is something incredibly fun about supporting this particular Crystal Palace team. They just don’t know when they’re beaten and regardless of the opposition, will throw everything at getting back into the game, then go behind and do it again, before missing a glorious chance to actually win the thing. Some things never change. I can’t decide whether it feels harsh to criticise them for not stealing all three points, or if it’s actually justifiable because Oliver Glasner has raised expectations. The same applies to Jean-Philippe Mateta: he deserves a lot of praise for scoring a hat-trick, two of which were classic centre-forward goals and the other was a stoppage time penalty that required a lot of composure; however, having done all that, he was in the perfect position for another textbook centre-forward goal to win the match and couldn’t convert the chance. Incidentally, had he scored a fourth, he would have been the first Crystal Palace player to do so since Johnny Byrne in 1960, when the Glaziers (as they then were) played in Division Four.",
      "* Overall though a draw with a side as good as Bournemouth is a good result for Palace, particularly after their club record unbeaten run was ended last time out. Palace fans think we’ve come a long way but we’re far behind the Cherries on that front. Andoni Iraola has them playing good football with a sense of ambition towards the European places that is far more realistic than other recent occupants of the Bournemouth dugout. Had Iraola’s team won on Saturday, they would have very briefly gone top of the Premier League, something inconceivable for most of their history but the way they’re playing this season makes perfect sense – in that respect, a point for Palace is a good result.",
      "* The family I was visiting was my octogenarian father in law and his partner. Watching the lunchtime game and the fallout led to some predictable conversations, like “why do they have to have a woman commentating”, “you don’t see players with names like Smith and Jones anymore”, and “where are all the British managers”. My answers to those were that Lucy Ward is actually a good co-commentator, you support Liverpool, who have a midfielder called Jones, and that in what is broadly a meritocracy, the British managers they mean aren’t good enough anymore. As Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day, there are only 20 Premier League jobs at any given time, so when one becomes available there will always be a long line of candidates, even when the club is in as much disarray as Nottingham Forest. People from all over the world will apply, so it would be incredibly strange if the strongest candidate ended up being Sam Allardyce, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes or Alan Pardew.",
      "* A side effect of Forest’s decision to sack Ange Postecoglou was that MOTD viewers had to sit through Micah Richards trotting out some incredibly tired analysis of the situation. Postecoglu had eight games, none of which ended in a victory and for most of which his team were absolutely dire. Eight games isn’t very long, but if his ideas were going to take effect at all, there would have been some sign of it happening before now. Richards said managers need time, but the manager who needs the time is the one who has to come in and fix the mess caused by the owner’s handling of the previous two managers, both of whom drew unfortunate comparisons with Roy Hodgson: Nuno Espirito Santo because of how reluctant his team could be to attack, and Postecoglu because of his teams’ unfortunate habit of conceding soon after half time. I’ve no idea what he says to people but, like Hodgson at Palace, you wonder if he would have been better off saying absolutely nothing.",
      "* People really need to stop comparing the current Arsenal team to Tony Pulis’s Stoke City, at least until an opposing player has done something ridiculous in a panic trying not to concede a set piece opportunity. Think players conceding corners so they didn’t have to defend a Rory Delap long throw, that’s the bar.",
      "* Liverpool conceding goals because their defenders are ball-watching instead of tracking the players they’re supposed to be marking? I for one am shocked by this. Well, I might be if I hadn’t watched Liverpool regularly for the past few years and mentioning it on a regular basis. I don’t think they need to worry too much about losing to Manchester United. It seems like when United were challenging for the title (a long time ago now obviously), they would often lose to Liverpool, so it makes perfect sense that the same would be true the other way round.\nEd Quoththeraven",

The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",

      "Harry Maguire stunned Liverpool as his 84th-minute header clinched Manchester United's first win at Anfield since 2016 and condemned the hosts to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "Maguire guided in Bruno Fernandes's cross just six minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out a controversial opening goal from Bryan Mbeumo only 62 seconds into a thrilling contest.",
      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",

      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",

      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",

      "\"We won't get carried away because we can't afford that as a club, we will use it as motivation.\"",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Ruben Amorim had cited his set-piece threat and he delivered.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",
      "\"He needed something, the pressure was building but a win at Anfield is huge.",
      "\"It's a great place for Manchester United to win a game of football.",
      "\"It's a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag.",

      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",

      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.Nick Wright",
      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
      "Frank, then, will be relieved their next three games are all away."

      "Gary Neville says the next few weeks are \"crucial\" for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era - and believes they should be able to get into the top six after a dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",
      "\"Amorim has got to start trusting those players. I know we talk about trusting Ruben Amorim and him being under pressure, and that's always going to be the case with the manager, but Ruben Amorim wants to be able to trust his players.",
      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",
      "\"There's no doubt those players admire their coach, they like him as a person, but they've got to start trusting each other, trust the system if you're the players, but also Ruben Amorim, trust his players that they can deliver consistently.",
      "\"I'm just looking towards next week now. Enjoy tonight because it's one of the greatest moments you can have as a United player, winning at Anfield, and it happens rarely, so enjoy tonight.",
      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "Player ratings as Man Utd beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield to claim first back-to-back league wins under Ruben Amorim; Harry Maguire headed winning goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's acrimonious opener; Liverpool have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2014",
      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
