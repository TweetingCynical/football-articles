      "Manchester United face a pivotal campaign this season - and planning is already well underway. A number of Red Devils return to Carrington on Monday for their first day of pre-season.",
      "And it’s probably fair to say that Ruben Amorim will have his stars hard at work as he attempts to recover from what was a woeful season last time out. Fortunately, work has already started on their summer business.",
      "A £62.5m deal for Matheus Cunha has already been rubber-stamped - with the Brazilian joining from Wolves - while Diego Leon became United’s second addition of the summer. But the work is not expected to end there.",
      "A new winger, as well as a striker, are also on the club’s shopping list. But will those deals get done in time?",
      "There’s less than two weeks before United’s first pre-season friendly of the summer against Leeds so Amorim will be keen to get moving. Take a look at the most pressing issues that the Portuguese coach needs to sort:",
      "The Brentford star has emerged as the Red Devils’ prime target of the summer - and all the signs point towards the deal being done. United have faced competition from Premier League rivals Tottenham but Mbeumo is currently prioritising a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "They have had two bids for Mbeumo rejected and are now contemplating a third which will be in the region of £65m. And should all go to plan, United will be optimistic of getting a deal done sooner rather than later.",
      "A deal for Mbeumo will take United’s spending this summer to around £130m, meaning they will likely need sales to offset that outlay. And there are already a number of candidates to leave.",
      "Last season’s loanees Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are all high on the list of potential departures. So Amorim will be very hopeful of finding suitors for all of the three.",
      "The exits are unlikely to stop there though. Goalkeeper Andre Onana is a candidate to leave on loan, while left-back Tyrell Malacia is unlikely to have a future at the club following a season with PSV.",
      "Finally, Alejandro Garnacho could also be sold amid apparent interest from Chelsea and Napoli. Amorim will surely want the future of his misfits decided before they fly away for their pre-season tour, but that could well be a tough task.",
      "Speaking of departures, Onana is one of a host of players who could leave. The Cameroonian goalkeeper has endured a tricky few seasons since joining for big money from Inter Milan.",
      "Reports have suggested that United are open to letting him leave on loan amid apparent interest from Monaco. And that has seen the club linked with a host of goalkeepers including Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Botafogo star John Victor.",
      "Amorim must come to a decision over his number one sooner rather than later. If he decides to let Onana go, a replacement needs to be signed but if he stays, Amorim needs to make it clear that he is his man going forward.",
      "And while Amorim has a decision to make between the sticks, the same could be said of the centre of his attack. Cunha and Mbeumo represent excellent additions to United’s frontline but they are unlikely to be leading the line this coming season.",
      "A central striker has long been on the club’s shopping list. Viktor Gyokeres was a strong candidate for a move but he now appears likely to become an Arsenal player instead.",
      "It could potentially leave United in a tricky position where they don’t have enough funds for a new striker, which may have to see Amorim put his faith in Rasmus Hojlund. But that decision needs to be made first.",
      "The past few seasons have obviously been rotten for United but there is one place that they have excelled - giving academy stars an opportunity. Kobbie Mainoo and Toby Collyer are two of the standout success stories over recent seasons.",
      "But with a lack of European football next season, the best way for the club’s young stars to get experience might be loan spells away. Dan Gore, Harry Amass and Ethan Wheatley are candidates for temporary moves, while there are also plenty of promising stars in the club’s academy ranks who could benefit from moves.",
      "Amorim needs to work with newly-appointed head of loans Jonny Evans to decide who could potentially be sent out on loans over the coming weeks.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "All three players were part of the Portugal squad who won the Nations League in July, beating Spain on penalties in the final. The United duo were scheduled to return to Manchester this week as the Red Devils begin pre-season training.",
      "But Fernandes and Dalot will be allowed to return later than the rest of United's first-team quad. The Sun report that the pair have both been granted a week's compassionate leave.",
      "A source adds that both players are 'heartbroken' and explains that United's squad have 'rallied around them'. Red Devils captain Fernandes and right-back Dalot each shared tributes on social media following Jota's death.",

      "United begin their pre-season campaign against Leeds in Sweden on Saturday, July 19. Ruben Amorim's team then play West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton on tour in the United States. Their fifth and final match is at home to Fiorentina on Saturday, August 9."

      "Manchester United's quest to improve Ruben Amorim's squad goes on with little over a month until the Premier League returns. And the Portuguese coach will soon have his squad in pre-season training ahead of a tour to the United States.",
      "The summer transfer window got off to a quick start with the arrival of Matheus Cunha, but the Red Devils have not been able to build on that momentum. Only the arrival of teenager star Diego Leon has been confirmed since with plenty of work to be done.",
      "United have failed to trim their squad thus far too. Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof departed at the end of their contracts, while Jonny Evans moved to a coaching role but Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho all remain at Old Trafford.",
      "But the club still hope to strengthen in their forward positions despite being unable to secure an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo thus far. An out-and-out striker may not go amiss for Amorim too.",
      "Manchester United are ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective solution for Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are in the process of rebuilding their squad the Portuguese coach is said to believe that Calvert-Lewin would be a useful addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Despite a poor injury record, reports claim that United believe the forward has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. United are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses tied into appearances as they eye a handy squad player.",
      "Calvert-Lewin left Everton after nine years at the end of June and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016.",
      "Any hope Manchester United had of landing Viktor Gyokeres appears to be over as Arsenal close in on deal for the Sweden striker. The Gunners are advancing in talks with Sporting Lisbon as the Portuguese side granted the striker additional time off as they seek to resolve his future.",
      "Andrea Berta had been progressing deals for Gyokeres and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the former now appears to have won out as Arsenal move closer to finally signing a striker.",
      "The two clubs have yet to agree on a fee but it is understood Arsenal and Gyokeres have already agreed personal terms. And with the player prioritising a move to Arsenal, having rejected other suitors, it now looks likely that a deal will be completed.",
      "Juventus are preparing to make an offer to Manchester United for Jadon Sancho. The Serie A side are said to have already held talks with the winger, who is reportedly open to life in Italy.",

    "body": [
      "Dan Ashworth's tenure as Manchester United's sporting director was a short-lived one, ending in disaster within just a few months. Ashworth was a prime target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who had to patiently wait over four months for him to officially commence his role due to being placed on gardening leave by his previous club, Newcastle United.",
      "It was on the 1st of July last year that Ashworth formally joined the Red Devils and immediately embarked on an ambitious recruitment campaign for then-manager Erik ten Hag, following United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "One of those other players was well-acquainted with Ten Hag, who was eager to reunite with. United shelled out £42m to bring former Ajax ace Matthijs De Ligt in from Bayern Munich.",
      "In a bid to provide Rasmus Hojlund with some assistance at the opposite end of the pitch, Ashworth activated Joshua Zirkzee's £34m buyout clause from Bologna after the Dutchman had aided the club in securing Champions League football for the first time in nearly six decades.",
      "Eager to bolster their defensive midfield – with Casemiro failing to replicate his Real Madrid form at the time – United sanctioned a move for Manuel Ugarte, who Paris Saint-Germain were willing to offload after just one season.",
      "A £40m offer was enough to secure the former Sporting CP star's services, eventually reuniting him with Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese boss' appointment as Ten Hag's successor last November.",
      "However, Ashworth departed United in December, before he could witness the outcome of his efforts. Over four months of the season had already elapsed upon Ashworth's exit and the performances of those three players left much to be desired.",
      "Despite De Ligt earning a formidable reputation in Europe since his teen years, he initially struggled to find his footing in Manchester's defence. While United endured a lacklustre season under Amorim, the Dutchman gradually found his rhythm in defence, sparking hopes among United fans that he will remain a key figure in their backline for years to come.",
      "The same optimism doesn't extend to Zirkzee, whose underwhelming presence has led United to continue their search for a striker to address their goalscoring issues – a role the former Bayern Munich forward was expected to fulfil.",
      "The 24-year-old has only managed to net seven goals in 49 matches across all competitions, with a mere three coming from Premier League games.",
      "His future at the club could be up in the air if Amorim succeeds in attracting ex-Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, despite Arsenal showing strong interest. Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also on United's current watchlist.",
      "As for Ugarte, the 24-year-old excels in tackling and regaining possession, typical traits of a defensive midfielder. However, he faced criticism last season due to his lack of forward play, with supporters arguing that his passing skills and athleticism are severely lacking.",
      "Amorim faces a colossal task ahead of the 2025/26 season, and it's yet to be seen what role these three players will have in United's future.",
      "And it seems unlikely that Ashworth's full quartet will be completed anytime soon. Branthwaite has recently signed a new contract with Everton under ex-United manager David Moyes.",
      "The England international, now reportedly valued at around £70m, inked a new five-year deal earlier this week.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin as a cost-effective addition to Ruben Amorim’s squad. United are rebuilding their squad in the summer transfer window and Amorim believes that Calvert-Lewin would be a good addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived at United for £62.5million from Wolves and the club are still chasing Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who will also cost north of £60m. But with the club conscious of profit and sustainability rules, they are also on the lookout for cheaper signings.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has left Everton after nine years and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016 and is seeking a fresh start.",
      "He has struggled with injuries in recent years, but The Sun reports that United believe he has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. They are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses for appearances so he could become a useful squad player in a role which could help avoid further injuries.",
      "United are still trying to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who all spent last season away on loan, as well as Alejandro Garnacho and, potentially, Rasmus Hojlund. With Cunha a No.10 and Mbeumo best off the right wing, Calvert-Lewin could slot into the forward line as a No.9.",
      "He managed just three goals in 26 Premier League games last season with injury sidelining him between January and May. But he is hungry for a new challenge after posting an emotional farewell to Everton upon the expiry of his contract on June 30.",
      "He wrote: \"To Everton Football Club and the Evertonians. After nine remarkable years at this club, I've made the incredibly difficult decision, together with my family, to begin a new chapter in my career.",
      "\"This isn't something I chose lightly. Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It's the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow, and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.",
      "\"Whether times were good or tough, your unwavering support never faltered. Celebrating goals at Goodison Park, feeling that roar, is an experience I'll carry with me forever. This choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together.",
      "\"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton. I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club.\"",

      "The Red Devils sold Elanga for £15m in 2023 and the Sweden international has thrived since. The Forest winger featured in all 38 Premier League games in 2024/25 and scored six goals and providing 11 assists as the club qualified for the Conference League.",

      "“ There is a lot of talk,\" Elanga said while on international duty last month, per Sport Witness. \"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",
      "“I guess there will always be scouts wherever I play,\" he added. \"As long as I stay focused and do my best in the match.",

      "Mbeumo is keen on a move to Manchester United this summer, but Brentford have already rejected two bids for the forward. United's last bid was worth an initial £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons and Brentford are said to want more than the £62.5m the Red Devils paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"He had a fantastic season,\" Brentford's director of football Phil Giles recently said when asked about Mbeumo's future. \"We expected big interest in him; we have had big interest in him. He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly demanding £25m for Jadon Sancho this summer, with the winger expected to complete a permanent exit after spending last season on loan at Chelsea.",
      "The Blues paid a £5m penalty fee to avoid signing Sancho permanently after he produced just eight goal contributions in 31 appearances in the Premier League. According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are ready to offer Sancho a fresh start.",
      "And the report states that United want around £25m to sell the forward, who is said to be keen on a move to Italy.",
      "Newcastle have made an improved £55m bid for former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga, according to the Mail.",
      "Elanga joined Nottingham Forest from United in 2023 and the report claims that the Red Devils will be owed around £15 per cent of the profits made if the winger is sold. Should Forest accept Newcastle's bid, United will receive £6m.",
      "Elanga enjoyed an impressive campaign last season, producing 17 goal contributions in 38 Premier League appearances for Forest as they finished seventh and qualified for Europe for the first time in almost 30 years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Marcus Rashford has made contact with Barcelona, after their £58million deal to sign Nico Williams collapsed in spectacular fashion. Williams, 22, was in talks to join Barca but their well-documented financial issues meant that they were unable to guarantee the Spanish winger that they could register him with La Liga.",
      "After weeks of fraught negotiations, Williams decided to instead sign a new 10-YEAR contract with Athletic Bilbao. That's left Barcelona looking for alternatives to strengthen their attacking department.",
      "Liverpool star Luis Diaz is their first-choice target, although the Reds are reluctant to sell the Colombian forward. Bayern Munich recently made an approach for Diaz, 28, which was firmly rebuffed by Liverpool who insist he's going nowhere.",
      "As such there is a gap to be filled at Barca, who have reportedly identified Rashford as their Plan B - with Rashford dreaming of joining the La Liga giants. He wants to test himself in another country rather than staying in the Premier League and Barca are his No.1 choice.",
      "However, with United demanding a fee of £40m, any deal with Barca for Rashford would likely be a loan - unless they can negotiate a drop in United's price tag.",
      "Rashford has told the Spanish champions that he'd be willing to take a pay cut on his £325,000-a-week salary. His brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, was spotted meeting Barcelona sporting director Deco in May.",
      "United say that Rashford has informed the club that he wants to explore a move away, as have Red Devils team-mates Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia. Matheus Cunha has also taken Rashford's No.10 shirt.",
      "Last month, the 27-year-old revealed that he wants to play alongside Barca wonderkid Lamine Yamal in a thinly-veiled come-get-me plea. \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best,\" Rashford told Spanish YouTube channel XBuyer. \"So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "Now the chances of him getting his dream move to Catalunya have increased. Athletic announced that Williams had signed a mammoth contract extension until 2035 on Friday morning.",
      "\"When it comes to making decisions, for me, the most important thing is to listen to your heart. I am where I want to be, with my people, this is my home,\" the Spain international commented.",
      "Bayern were also interested in signing Williams, whose release clause has reportedly risen to around £87m.",
      "\"The step forward Nico Williams has taken with this renewal fills the entire Athletic Club family with pride and paints a picture of a future as ambitious as it is exciting,\" the club added.",
      "\"This latest display of loyalty marks a milestone in the history of the club and confirms a path of trust in the sporting project. He will continue to wear the number 10 inherited from Iker Muniain, with the Champions League as his new stage. His step forward in the face of dizzying offers is a resounding success for Athletic Club.\""

      "Marcus Rashford has seen his No.10 shirt at Manchester United handed to Matheus Cunha - in another sign that there will be no return for the England striker at Old Trafford.",
      "Indeed, Rashford is one of five players who want to leave the club and, having informed the club of their desire to do so, will be allowed to report for duty later in July, rather than reporting back at Carrington next week for pre-season testing.",
      "The other four are Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. All will be allowed to report for pre-season back at Carrington late as they seek to finalise moves away, having told the club they are keen to move on.",
      "The club have confirmed that their medical and rehabilitation facilities will remain available to the players, should they want it. Remote support will also continue as it has during the off-season.",
      "Sources also insist that if the players cannot get themselves fixed up with moves elsewhere, then they WILL be welcomed back ahead of the new season - although it will then be down to head coach Ruben Amorim to decide what to do with them.",
      "Rashford, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, loses his No.10 shirt at the club as he continues to push for a move away. He is keen to try his luck in another country, with Barcelona his preferred destination.",
      "That move has appeared unlikely for much of the summer, with Barca prioritising a move for Spain winger Nico Williams. But amid worries over the Blaugrana's ability to register Williams if they paid his release clause to Athletic Bilbao, amid the club's financial issues, the player has duly signed a new long-term deal with Athletic until 2035, confirming that he won't be moving this summer.",
      "That offers an opening to Rashford, either on a permanent deal or on loan, particularly with Liverpool insisting that another Barca target, Luis Diaz, is going nowhere this summer.",
      "Sancho is looking to join Juventus after seeing Chelsea pay £5m to get out of spending £25m to sign him permanently after his loan spell, while Garnacho, who had been an important piece of Amorim's side for much of last term, is seeking an exit after falling out with the Portuguese. Frustrated at only being a substitute in the Europa League Final loss to Spurs, his post-match comments were the last straw and he was told by the United boss he can leave.",
      "Malacia has been out on loan at PSV Eindhoven, who decided not to make his loan move permanent for £8.3m, and has no future at the club after an injury hit spell, while Antony was a major hit on loan at Real Betis, who are eager to sign him permanently if they can negotiate an affordable price.",
      "Another option is sending him back to Seville on a season-long loan deal, with an obligation to buy next summer, with United looking to recoup around £30m on the Brazilian.",

      "Real Betis are confident Manchester United will 'give in' on their transfer demands for Antony, as the La Liga side plan to take advantage to sign the winger who impressed on loan last term. Betis are prepared to be patient to come to another loan agreement, per AS, and the club are more than hopeful of coming to a deal should no 'high-flying' offers arrive.",
      "The Red Devils want to sell the Brazil international after he was unable to break into Ruben Amorim's plans following the Portuguese coach's arrival. Betis are interested in a deal after Antony became a key player in taking the team to the Conference League final.",
      "The ex-Ajax star will need to be prepared to take a pay-cut to secure the move after feeling at home in Spain working under Manuel Pellegrini. But a deal may have to wait until nearer the end of the window as United try to secure a fee for a permanent move.",
      "Antony scored nine goals and produced five assists in 26 appearances for Betis after joining the club. A transfer has seen little progress thus far, despite a willingness on all sides to see an Old Trafford exit.",
      "Speaking this week, Real Betis president Angel Haro spoke to Cope Sevilla, per Sport Witness, and suggested the move was outside of their control. Haro stressed Antony’s return depends 'on Manchester United, Antony and on Betis being willing to pay the transfer fee”.",
      "“He’s a fantastic player; he’s given us a lot in the last six months, but we have to get everything right; we can’t go crazy. We’re working on that path because it’s not easy,\" said Haro.",
      "“We’re very imaginative when it comes to approaching this type of transaction, but it’s complex. It involves the player, who loves Betis, but he also has to consider his own interests.”",
      "Betis are expected to raise some funds through Johnny Cardoso's move to Atlietco Madrid this summer. The Spanish side could bring in £26m to aid any offer for Antony.",
      "Antony is among a number of United players the club are attempting to facilitate permanent exits for. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are all yet to find a new club despite the 13-times Premier League champions deciding they want to part ways.",
      "Sancho is said to be in talks over a possible move to Juventus after Chelsea paid a £5million fee in order to cancel turning the star's loan into a permanent deal. Rashford meanwhile could have renewed hope of a move to Barcelona after their target, Nico Williams, extended his stay at Athletic Bilbao."

      "Former Manchester United star Gabriel Heinze once was regarded as a legend in the making at the club. Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

      "Ahead of United's pre-season opener against Leeds United in Norway a week on Saturday, MEN Sport has picked out six players who will have a point to prove this summer.",
      "Onana was linked with a move to French club AS Monaco recently, but has returned to Carrington under the impression he will start the new season as United's No.1.",
      "If that is to be the case, his performances between the posts must improve. Amorim wants a new keeper to compete with the Cameroonian, meaning that should motivate the former Ajax man to raise his game.",
      "With less than 12 months left on his existing deal, it remains to be seen if Casemiro will still be a United player come the end of the transfer window. He has made no secret of his desire to stay, but the absence of European football in 2025/26 could force United's hand.",
      "Casemiro's Europa League performances were excellent in the second half of last term, but his domestic performances left a lot to be desired. He struggled with the speed and the intensity of the Premier League.",
      "No club has so far submitted an offer for the Brazilian. His pre-season performances may also have a decisive say in United's thinking regarding his future.",
      "Signed from Paris Saint-Germain almost a year ago, Ugarte was expected to fix United's midfield woes. Instead, he is not guaranteed a regular starting berth ahead of the new season.",
      "As good as he often was defensively, his ability on the ball was frequently questioned. The Premier League is played at a much quicker tempo in comparison to what he had been used to in France and Portugal.",
      "At the age of 24, Ugarte still has time to improve and adapt, and a first full pre-season at United could help him. But if he is to occupy one of the two central midfield spots come the start of the season, a solid pre-season feels imperative.",
      "It is no secret just how much Amorim admires Mount, meaning there is every chance he could play a very important role in the Portuguese's plans for 2025/26. His United career has been plagued by injuries thus far and he will be determined to make up for lost time.",
      "He offered glimpses of his capabilities towards the end of last season and scored twice in the Europa League semi-final second leg triumph over Athletic Club at Old Trafford. The question everyone will be asking will be can he stay fit? If he can stay injury-free there is every chance he will have a big role to play.",
      "After joining United last summer to operate as a No.9, it quickly became clear that Zirkzee had never been a natural goalscorer. Fortunately for him, he was able to flex his muscles as a No.10 in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "That role suits him down to the ground, so much so he was just getting into his stride when he encountered a hamstring injury in April. However, United have signed Matheus Cunha and hope to add Bryan Mbeumo, meaning United's No.10 options could soon be stacked, limiting Zirkzee's game time.",
      "He is unlikely to have a long-term future at Old Trafford, meaning a sale this summer cannot be dismissed. His pre-season performances may dictate United's thinking.",
      "With the addition of a striker United's top priority this summer, they are prepared to sell Hojlund. He has generated interest from Inter Milan and has also been linked with a move to Napoli.",
      "After a solid first season at United saw him score 16 goals, he regressed last term, scoring just 10. Patience is wearing thin and United desperately need a new No.9.",
      "However, the Dane has not had a full pre-season at the club since arriving from Atalanta nearly two years ago, meaning this summer could be a make or break period for him."

      "He made the bench for the first-team on eight occasions, highlighting that Amorim felt he was ready to step into the breach if required. But with Andre Onana poised to continue as the club's No.1, Tom Heaton tied down to a new deal and a new goalkeeper being targeted, the 19-year-old could struggle for opportunities in 2025/26.",

      "Already a regular for Gibraltar's senior team, earning 14 caps, Scanlon is approaching a point in his career where he needs regular first-team football at club level to try and take his development to the next level.",
      "Turning 19 in September, the attacker, who predominantly plays on the left-wing, has trained with United's first-team and was on the bench for the 4-1 Europa League win over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford back in March.",
      "His impressive performances last term could earn him a place on this summer's pre-season tour. Beyond that, though, a loan move would be a sensible idea.",
      "Moorhouse will be attempting to make up for lost time in 2025/26 after a difficult time with injuries last season. Renowned as one of the brightest and most exciting talents in United's academy, the 19-year-old is one to watch.",
      "He featured in both of United's post-season tour friendlies in May, starting the 1-0 defeat to the ASEAN All-Stars, and he offered evidence of being an excellent ball-carrier. He operates in central areas, making him a potentially ideal fit for one of the two No.10 roles in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Having played just 12 times for the Under-21s last season because of injury issues, United may decide to keep a closer eye on Moorhouse and allow him to continue for the Under-21s at Carrington. But in the event of them being open to sending him out on loan, he would be a smart signing for a number of lower league clubs.",
      "Moorhouse is excellent on the ball and he has the ability to make things happen inside the final third.",
      "Few players in United's academy generated as much attention as Biancheri last season. The striker scored 25 goals for the Under-18s and Under-21s combined, meaning he was the academy's top goalscorer.",
      "Formerly of Cardiff City, the 18-year-old spent time with the Canadian national team at a training camp earlier this summer amid his qualification to represent both them and Wales at international level. However, he is yet to represent Canada at any level.",
      "As far as his club career is concerned, he has already admitted he is open to heading out on loan this coming season and getting some experience under his belt. However, the fact he does not turn 19 until September could mean United keep him for the first half of the season before considering a loan exit in January.",
      "Nevertheless, his goalscoring record at youth level will be appealing to clubs lower down the pyramid, meaning they could be willing to take a punt on him."

      "Oyedele left Old Trafford last August, sealing a surprise permanent switch to Polish club Legia Warsaw. He enjoyed a stellar debut campaign in Poland last term and is now being linked with clubs right across Europe.",
      "The 20-year-old made 24 appearances in his debut campaign at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time. He also helped them reach the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League.",
      "Having made such a telling impression, the former Forest Green Rovers loanee is now being linked with a cluster of clubs, including German outfits Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen.",
      "The defensive midfielder, who can also operate at the back, was sold by United last summer for a small initial fee, which included a substantial future sell-on clause to ensure profit in the event of him making a name for himself in Poland.",
      "It is understood Oyedele has a release clause in his Legia contract worth €6million (£5.18m at the current exchange rate). It has been widely reported that the sell-on clause United inserted into the deal was worth 40 per cent, meaning they stand to bank just north of £2m.",
      "In a summer in which sales are crucial for United to generate money to raise funds for new arrivals, every penny they secure will be welcomed.",
      "United improved their success rate in the seller's market in last summer's transfer window, offloading a crop of players they felt had either run out of time at Old Trafford or were unlikely to ever make the grade.",
      "As was the case with Oyedele's switch to Legia, United inserted sell-on clauses into a several deals that saw youngsters offloaded. Any funds the Reds bank via sell-on clauses will assist them in their efforts to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United also inserted a buy-back clause into the deal that saw Oyedele move to Poland, meaning they have the option to re-sign him. He has also been linked with a return to England amid interest from unnamed Championship clubs."

      "Amorim knows the pressure will increase if United suffer a slow start to the season and it means work on the training pitch is vital. The old Trafford chief was short of time last term with a relentless fixture list but he’ll get plenty of it over the coming weeks and with no European football on the schedule for next term, Amorim will have the opportunity to right the wrongs of last season.",
      "Pre season is often the time we see youngsters afforded opportunities to impress.",
      "Amorim has shown he is prepared to offer chances to prospects with Chido Obi and Ayden Heaven regularly handed senior minutes in the latter stages of last season while Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also featured.",
      "That quartet will have eyes on cementing senior squad spots over the coming weeks while there are several promising players amid the successful United academy ranks who will be harbouring hopes of making the step up.",
      "Jack Fletcher, Sekou Kone and Bendito Mantato among others will be out to impress.",
      "Matheus Cunha is the headline act of United’s summer so far.",
      "Monday will see the £62.5million arrival join up with his new teammates for the first time. The hope is that the Brazil international will be able to revitalise United’s blunt attack.",
      "The Reds still harbour hopes of completing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo with the forward keen to join but so far talks have yet to yield a breakthrough with Brentford.",
      "Cunha will surely occupy one of the number 10 roles at Old Trafford and getting the new man up to speed as quickly as possible will be a key priority for Amorim this week."

      "Rashford joined Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia in wishing to explore new opportunities after they all spent time on loan away from Old Trafford last season. As a result, not only was Rashford's return for pre-season delayed but he saw his number 10 shirt handed to new signing Matheus Cunha following his move from Wolves.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with a shock move for former Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "The Reds' need for a new No.9 is yet to be reflected in their business so far. United have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Diego Leon, while a move for Bryan Mbeumo is advanced - even though there is yet to be a breakthrough.",
      "None of those players are seen as a striker. United's record of 44 league goals last term was comfortably their fewest in a generation and played a key role in their lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in the 1970s.",
      "It's why reports linking Calvert-Lewin with a move to Old Trafford will worry so many. While he may have the Premier League experience the Reds are clearly looking for this summer - being released by Everton should put him out of any consideration at M16.",
      "Injury woes and a dreadful campaign at Goodison Park, which saw him score just three goals, highlight his decline. He may only be 28 but already it looks like his best days are behind him.",
      "In fairness to United, it's still relatively early in the summer window for panic. The Reds would have liked to have made more progress by now, with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad arriving for pre-season training on Monday.",
      "PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) constraints need to be considered, particularly when no sales have been made. It is also sensible for the club not to chuck money at players, as they were often accused of in previous windows.",
      "But Viktor Gyokeres' likely move to Arsenal has left United with even fewer options in a summer when good-quality strikers are at a premium. Other players linked, including Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike, are likely to be expensive, and there is no guarantee they would be keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It's too early to panic and yet as the new season edges closer, anxiety will rise and pressure will only grow before a campaign where the Reds must get things right."

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",
      "He will receive a brilliant reception and it's great to see him enjoying his football again."

      "And then there's United. 15th in the Premier League last season, no European football to look forward and a mishmash of a squad that needs gutting.",
      "The summer transfer window represents a crucial time for two sides looking to send a message to the rest of the Premier League. Outgoings will be as important as incomings, and the two clubs may find themselves in direct competition.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish both enjoyed superb 2022/23 seasons, with the former bagging the first 30-goal haul of his career and Grealish playing a vital role in City's historical treble. Their stock has fallen dramatically since then and both could be on the move this summer.",
      "Rashford has told United he wants to leave and City are searching for a buyer for Grealish. While Rashford and Grealish are two very different players, both forwards will command hefty wages and their respective clubs won't be willing to let them leave for pennies - United want £40m for Rashford and that same figure is claimed to be enough to sign Grealish this summer.",
      "Moving them on isn't going to be easy, and the task will only be made tougher by a club on the other side of the city looking to sell a player who will undoubtedly be linked with the same clubs.",
      "Few could have envisioned Rashford and Grealish being sold a few years ago. Both players needs to find new clubs this summer, but that's easier said than done."

      "Portuguese newspaper A Bola has now suggested that Sporting might be open to negotiating the €80m asking price with 'realistic variables', hinting at a possible €70m (£60m) upfront payment with an additional €10m (£8m) in performance-related bonuses.",
      "Gyokeres is expected to return for pre-season training on Monday, July 7, yet whether he will show up remains uncertain amid speculation in Portugal to the contrary.",

      "Barcelona, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Lyon, Porto and Hajduk Split were all stung by UEFA on Friday evening, with punishments ranging from £17.25million to £259k.",
      "United know they need to sell to buy this summer and so news that the likes of Barcelona and Chelsea have been hit with fines will not be welcome. Not least when it comes to the sale of Marcus Rashford.",
      "The academy graduate is one of the five players to have told the club he is seeking opportunities away from Old Trafford, and he will not return to Carrington for pre-season next week. Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have all had their return date pushed back until mid July to offer them the opportunity to find a new club.",
      "Rashford's United career has been over for some time, and his number 10 shirt being passed to Matheus Cunha was the final nail in the coffin. But what comes next?",
      "The academy graduate recently floated the possibility of playing at Barcelona in a chat with a Spanish influencer, but with the Catalan giants struggling to balance the books even before they were slapped with a £13m fine, are they genuinely in a position to offer Rashford what he will want?",
      "Not only will Rashford demand a hefty salary, there's also the transfer fee to consider. United want £40m for the England international, and while Barca aren't exactly working on a shoestring budget, there's been a notable tightening of the purse strings over the last couples of seasons at Camp Nou.",
      "With wages totalling nearly £17m a year and a £40m transfer fee, Rashford won't come cheap. One of the biggest clubs in Europe being handed a £13m isn't the news United or Rashford wanted."

      "Arsenal want a Chelsea winger, while the Blues are linked with a Gunners starlet. Also: progress of sorts over Viktor Gyokeres…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Ethan Nwaneri – Arsenal to Chelsea\nArsenal would be right to be concerned about the prospect of losing Nwaneri given the academy graduate is a year from having his pick of clubs as a free-agent. Nwaneri’s preference is to stay at Arsenal but he wants more minutes. The obvious solution for the teenager is to stay put and reassess over the course of the coming season.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. And Madueke will certainly be cheaper.",
      "",
      "18) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nThe Spain Under-21 midfielder has a release clause worth £87million but United – and other clubs – reckon he’s attainable for a quarter of that sum. Apparently, Guerra is ‘close’ to joining United but we’re not buying it – yet.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nWe’re not sure how many offers West Ham have rejected, but the latest was reportedly worth £50million plus £12.5million in add-ons. West Ham need to sell but they also need to squeeze Spurs for as much as they can given what they make is what Graham Potter can spend.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",
      "",
      "14) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern were looking for a wide forward even before Jamal Musiala’s injury at the Club World Cup. Diaz’s willingness to move appears greater than Liverpool’s intent to sell, so the Colombian may have to force the issue if he’s really so keen to try something new.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca’s hopes of signing Luis Diaz appear dashed, which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "12) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars who, as expected, are proving stubborn to shift.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nSancho is refusing to leave any of the final year of his United salary on the table, which is making things awkward for everyone. The winger is perfectly entitled to the money in his contract, but Juventus feels like an opportunity he shouldn’t miss if he has any intent to get his career back on track.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were looking for clarity over what a deal for Nunez might involve but, understandably, the transfer market has been the last thing on Liverpool minds over recent days. One of their alternative targets, Ange-Yoan Bonny, has joined Inter so Napoli’s options are more limited.",
      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £20million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year. This will go for as long as Valencia are stubborn.",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe noise around this one is increasing, with Madueke perhaps the most achievable left winger target, assuming Eberechi Eze is a separate pursuit. Chelsea need to sell, as they seemingly always do, to meet UEFA guidelines and they are expecting an offer from Arsenal. Given the Gunners’ lack of haste this summer, we suggest the Blues don’t hold their breath, but we would certainly keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "6) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before this week, with a chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. Having missed their own deadline, there is talk they could walk away, but even United wouldn’t come this far just to ditch it.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man. Lord knows they need a win in the transfer market.",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nReports suggest that Arsenal have made progress but they are yet to reach an agreement with Sporting. There is, apparently, a desire for all parties to get a deal done but for everyone to be satisfied, Arsenal will have to get to £70million. This feels like a saga but, in fairness to the Gunners, what was the hurry before pre-season? That time is now upon us, though…",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry, who bagged 11 goals last season, was flying somewhere prior to the weekend, we assume into Merseyside.",
      "",
      "1) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nArsenal are taking their sweet time to get deals done this summer and Norgaard seems to be the next cab off the rank since a medical is apparently done following a deal being struck worth in the region of £10million.",

      "Arsenal are closing in on the signing of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres. Will he be more Islam Slimani or Bruno Fernandes? We’ve ranked the biggest Premier League signings from the Portuguese top flight.",
      "To avoid a colossal list with every single Liga Portugal signing, we made the cut-off point 20million euros on Transfermarkt, and anyone who turned out to have cost less than £15million after a quick Google search was ditched. That conveniently left us with 30 names, which was pleasing…",
      "30) Fabio Silva (Porto to Wolves, £35.6m)\nWhat a very expensive mistake. Signing Football Manager wonderkids isn’t always a great idea. And yes, he’s still technically a Wolves player.",
      "",
      "29) Lazar Markovic (Benfica to Liverpool, £20m)\nLiverpool were supposed to be signing a wonderkid, but Markovic was anything but; he’s now 31 and without a club after leaving FC Baniyas in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "",
      "28) Adrien Silva (Sporting to Leicester, £22m)\nLeicester famously missed the deadline to sign Silva in the 2017 summer transfer window by 14 seconds.",
      "He never scored for the Foxes in 21 matches, left for AS Monaco after three years, and didn’t score in 40 matches for the French club. Leicester should have taken that 14-second failure as a sign.",
      "",
      "27) Giannelli Imbula (Porto to Stoke, £18.3m)\nImbula is best remembered for tweeting things like ‘New season how many goals for Imbula’ or simply posting photos of himself playing for Stoke with his name as the caption. He gave Victor Wanyama and Wayne Rooney a run for their money on Twitter.",
      "On the pitch, he couldn’t get anywhere near the dizzy heights of Wanyama. He’s been without a club since February 2024 and as far as we’re aware, Imbula hasn’t yet called time on his career. Despite joining the Potters as one of the most exciting midfielders in Europe, he only played 28 times, scoring twice.",
      "",
      "26) Islam Slimani (Sporting to Leicester, £29.7m)\nSlimani scored 61 goals in 123 games for Sporting – an impressive record but not so fantastic that Arsenal fans should fear Viktor Gyokeres will be just as poor in the Premier League.",
      "In my head, he was awful, but seven goals in 23 Premier League games in 2016/17 says otherwise. That’s hardly an outstanding return, but the fact he didn’t put up numbers to match Niclas Fullkrug in 2024/25 is surprising.",
      "",
      "25) Eliaquim Mangala (Porto to Manchester City, £32m at least)\nAnother iconic Twitter moment is when an Everton fan said this to Mangala during his time on loan: ‘seriously mate no joking please just don’t play again prem not suited to u pal your crap no hard feelings just not worked out @ Mangala’.",
      "Yeah…he wasn’t great. For City or Everton. He’s another one currently a free agent.",
      "",
      "24) Darwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64.2m plus £21.2m in add-ons)\nIt’s just not worked out for poor Darwin at Anfield. The word ‘raw’ has been associated with him since day one, and at 26 years of age, you don’t want to be tagged as ‘raw’. He will almost certainly leave Liverpool this summer after scoring seven goals in 47 matches last season.",
      "MORE: Benfica are the greatest salesmen in football; even Brighton cannot touch them",
      "",
      "23) Nico Gonzalez (Porto to Manchester City, £50m)\nThere’s talk of Nico leaving City already, having only joined for a huge fee in January. If that happens, his ranking will tank.",
      "",
      "22) Fabio Vieira (Porto to Arsenal, £34.2m)\nVieira’s poor physical attributes have caused him to struggle in England. He spent last season on loan back at Porto and it’s anyone’s guess what happens now. Eberechi Eze joining would surely mean the end for him at the Emirates.",
      "",
      "21) Marcos Rojo (Sporting to Manchester United, £16m)\nRojo was quite entertaining, but only because he was a classic, chaotic Argentine. Like a taller, more unhinged, less talented Lisandro Martinez.",
      "",
      "20) Javi Garcia (Benfica to Manchester City, £15.8m)\nTwo-cap Spanish midfielder Garcia joined from Benfica for a respectable fee as Roberto Mancini sought more physicality in his title-winning midfield. He played 76 times for the Cityzens and was a real ‘does a job’ player.",
      "",
      "19) Victor Lindelof (Benfica to Manchester United, £30.7m plus £8.8m in add-ons)\nThe Swedish centre-back was simply ‘meh’ for United, which is not exactly what you want for close to £40million.",
      "",
      "18) Jose Bosingwa (Porto to Chelsea, £16.2m)\nIt’s hard to see Bosingwa’s name without thinking of his studded assault on Yossi Benayoun that didn’t even result in a yellow card. That, and the fact he had a monobrow.",
      "",
      "17) Anderson (Porto to Manchester United, £20m)\nAfter his first season at Old Trafford, Anderson won the 2008 Golden Boy award. He’s a weird one, really. It’s obvious that he didn’t reach the heights expected, but he wasn’t a bad player. Sitting near the middle here feels right.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes (Sporting to Wolves, £38m plus £4.2m in add-ons)\nWolves winning the race to sign highly-rated young midfielder Nunes wasn’t overly surprising given their Portuguese ties through Jorge Mendes, but it was still a coup.",
      "He wasn’t as good as expected but they still sold him for a profit to Man City.",
      "",
      "15) Diogo Dalot (Porto to Manchester United, £19m)\nOverall, this has been a pretty decent signing, and Dalot sitting middle of the road is a good indication that Liga Portugal signings have been pretty successful in Our League.",
      "",
      "14) Evanilson (Porto to Bournemouth, £31m plus £8.5m in add-ons)\nReplacing Dominic Solanke was always going to be tricky, but Bournemouth nailed it with Evanilson. He’s very different, but just as effective up front. The Cherries will hope to repeat the trick when replacing Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "",
      "13) Raul Jimenez (Benfica to Wolves, £30m)\nJimenez’s horrific skull fracture understandably hindered the second half of his Wolves career. His form was never the same, but overall, he was a very good signing.",
      "",
      "12) Ricardo Pereira (Porto to Leicester, £17.5m plus £4.3m in add-ons)\nPereira hasn’t been the same since suffering an ACL injury in March 2019. He’s become very injury-prone and his performances have understandably declined. Before that, though, he was one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. And he wasn’t too expensive.",
      "",
      "11) Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThe huge transfer fee for Fernandez makes him hard to rank, but there’s no doubt he has improved a lot under Enzo Maresca. In truth, he was never rubbish for Chelsea. He barely put a foot wrong, but just didn’t look like a £100m+ midfielder. He still doesn’t – but certainly looks a lot closer to one than before.",
      "MORE: Virgil van Dijk tops ranking of all 17 £70m-plus Premier League signings",
      "",
      "10) Pedro Porro (Sporting to Tottenham, £39.7m)\nSpurs nailed it with this one, even if the signing felt confusing for a while. It felt like Porro was signed as Antonio Conte’s perfect right-wing-back, yet everyone, Conte included, knew he was never going to last in north London.",
      "And then when Ange Postecoglou came in, Porro’s place in the team was uncertain. It quickly became clear that he’s an elite right-back and perfectly fine in a back four.",
      "",
      "9) Ramires (Benfica to Chelsea, £18.2m)\nBenfica must love it when they hear a knock at the door and it’s Chelsea stood there, putting their index fingers together and cutely saying, ‘It’s me again’.",
      "This was a low fee in comparison to Fernandez and friends, but still hugely successful. Best remembered for that chip against Barcelona, Ramires helped the Blues win the Champions League in 2012. He was a brilliantly consistent presence in the midfield with his ridiculous pace and engine.",
      "",
      "8) David Luiz (Benfica to Chelsea, £21.3m)\nChelsea have quite the history when it comes to signing talents from the Portuguese top flight. Luiz’s first spell at Stamford Bridge was between January 2011 and July 2014, when he joined Paris Saint-Germain for over £40m.",
      "Luiz was unpredictable, but that was kind of the charm with him. When PSG paid that huge fee, a lot of people were pretty surprised. Years later, I’m still not sure if he was brilliant or s**t.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Porto to Liverpool, £37m plus £12m in add-ons)\nCurrently wanted by Barcelona and Bayern Munich, the Reds are reluctant to sell Diaz, even if he is very purply patchy, 28 years old, out of contract in two years, and could fetch a significant transfer fee.",
      "While the Colombian has it in him to score once in 15 matches, he also has it in him to score 15 goals in as many games. Don’t turn your nose up at seven assists and 13 goals in a title-winning campaign.",
      "",
      "6) Joao Palhinha (Sporting to Fulham, £20m)\nThe price varies online, but what is for certain is that Palhinha was a huge success at Craven Cottage. And Fulham flipped him to Bayern Munich for a huge profit after two very productive years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson (Benfica to Manchester City, £34.7m)\nAfter sacking off Joe Hart, there were some major goalkeeper teething issues for Pep Guardiola, with Claudio Bravo coming in and performing very unconvincingly.",
      "Guardiola wanted a world-class ball-playing goalkeeper and he signed one in Ederson for a modest fee. He’s been well worth the money, even if errors have been creeping into his game more and more as the years pass by.",
      "",
      "4) Ricardo Carvalho (Porto to Chelsea, £19.85m)\nWhen Jose Mourinho joined Chelsea from Champions League winners Porto in 2004, a few players followed, including Paulo Ferreira and Carvalho.",
      "After playing every minute in the Portuguese club’s Champions League-winning campaign, Carvalho casually helped the Blues romp to a Premier League title after Arsenal went an entire campaign unbeaten, and helped them to a monstrous defensive record of only 15 goals conceded across the 38-game season. If a Premier League record is ageing like a fine wine, it’s that one.",
      "",
      "3) Nemanja Matic (Benfica to Chelsea, £21m)\nChelsea first signed Matic from Slovakian outfit MFK Kosice for pennies in 2009, selling him to Benfica for around £3m two years later. It took the Blues little time to realise they’d messed up and re-signed the Serbian midfielder for big money two-and-a-half years later.",
      "Matic was only 25 when he returned to Stamford Bridge and he quickly became an integral player in Jose Mourinho’s team, which convincingly won the Premier League title in 2014/15.",
      "He was a rock in midfield and scored the occasional banger as well, which is always a nice extra for your ball-winning midfielder to have.\nThere wasn’t much to separate Matic and Carvalho, so the fact the former was sold to Manchester United for around £40m, while the latter only left for around £7m, gives the midfielder the edge.",
      "",
      "2) Bruno Fernandes (Sporting to Manchester United, £47m plus £20.7m in add-ons)\nIt would take some doing to top Fernandes to United, but that’s exactly what’s happened.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has been an incredible player for United and is comfortably their best signing since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "",
      "1) Ruben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £62m plus £3m in add-ons)\nDias quickly became a huge player in City’s defence when he arrived in 2020 and was instrumental in multiple title wins. He walked into the team and instantly became a leader, helping his new club reach the Champions League final and win the Premier League title by 12 points.",
      "He was named FWA Footballer of the Year, Manchester City Player of the Year, Premier League Player of the Season and the UEFA Champions League Defender of the Season in 2021 after an outstanding debut season. He remains a leading Premier League centre-back four years on.",

      "The only reason to persist with Ruben Amorim after his first few months was to give him a proper pre-season. But Manchester United have failed to deliver.",
      "",
      "When Ruben Amorim returned to Carrington on Friday morning he must have wondered whether his pre-summer parting message for Manchester United “to be really strong and to be brave” had been lost in translation.",
      "The deadwood he cut adrift had washed back ashore. The new signings he was promised were not yet delivered. The dumpster fire he abandoned was still raging.",
      "By the most crucial juncture of perhaps the biggest summer transfer window in Manchester United history, five players known to have no future at the club were officially transfer-listed and one release clause was activated.",
      "It is impossible to think this was the “clear picture” Amorim referenced at the end of May, or that he feels this is the best way to “use every minute in every week of pre-season”.",
      "With players reporting for duty on Monday morning, Manchester United are working against the clock and wasting precious time.",
      "Amorim has discussed the importance of pre-season before, the specific lack of which he felt contributed to last season’s struggles.",
      "“I want them to know me in the different ways and not always preparing the match, with stress!” he said in January. “Spending three weeks together, creating something and then you want to create something where you know the players. We do not have the time to do.",
      "“I think that is the secret of teams, even when you have the best players and that feeling, it is really hard to win and I wanted to build something like that here. But we need time for that.”",
      "It is time his employers are already eating into. Matheus Cunha was a fine addition but a straightforward capture even the Ratcliffe brains trust could not bungle, while a predictable inability to sell has hampered any further movement.",
      "Beyond that, deadlines have been set and passed to sign Bryan Mbeumo, with either possible outcome making Manchester United look varying degrees of foolish: if they do not set an overdue precedent by walking away from a deal they feel has been inflated, they must instead meet demands which were never going to be lowered.",
      "Omar Berrada pledged last month to “do our best to do more signings quickly” but the immediate backtrack – “sometimes when you’re not quick it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money” – was revealing; Manchester United almost always find the unfathomable third option of taking too long to wrap up signings which become too expensive.",
      "The argument to remain patient with Amorim hinged on him needing a pre-season, and the Portuguese having time and space to work on integrating the players he wants into his fabled system. It was the only reason to persevere with an idea which turned out to be atrocious in practice last season.",
      "That argument collapses in on itself the longer he is given the same squad he has already failed spectacularly with, unless the belief is that Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof were the bad apples causing everything else to rot.",

      "A few months of acclimatisation might do wonders for Patrick Dorgu’s confidence and capability levels. Diego Leon could hit the ground running as a teenager playing and living outside of Paraguay for the first time in his life. There may happen to be some ludicrously talented wing-backs, centre-forwards, goalkeepers and holding midfielders in the Academy waiting to emerge.",
      "But Manchester United cannot afford much in their current state, let alone relying on possibilities, suppositions and estimations.",
      "They need guarantees and certainties, absolutes and assurances. That is why the return of an old transfer policy made complete sense in early June but the longer the current situation drags into July, the more impeded Amorim’s start – already far further back than first anticipated – will be.",
      "Cunha alone cannot hope to galvanise and refresh this group with his mere presence. The spectres of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony still linger. The sense that Manchester United are entirely incapable of negotiating more than one transfer at a time persists.",
      "Making Mbeumo a priority target is one thing but other opportunities are going unexplored. The instinct might be to raise an eyebrow at the reported pursuit of Dominic Calvert-Lewin but a free agent with substantial experience and no settling-in period in a position Manchester United must reinforce at least makes sense without being particularly inspiring.",
      "Yet not every signing needs to come with a statement, not every purchase must send a message. Sensible squad building requires far more cost-effective deals than it does extravagant ones, even if they cannot feed the ego quite as emphatically.",
      "And that ego will almost certainly need to take a hit over the valuation of the players they openly wish and need to sell before buying. As Berrada put it, there is a need to “balance the books”.",
      "But he also said “we’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting,” and the only way to make such a risible defence of widespread redundancies and ludicrous cutbacks more shameful is to squander that apparent place of strength.",
      "“I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into,” he added, and they might well do. But the point was only ever to give Amorim a stronger team to work with to maximise his “secret” weapon of pre-season.",
      "Manchester United have failed on that count already. Their first friendly is in 12 days before they fly out to the United States for a tournament which bleeds into August. Every minute ticking away with neither a signing nor a sale feels like part of the countdown to Amorim’s demise rather than the start of his great rebuild.",

So there might be movement in July on Rashford because he wants to play Champions League football and move as quickly as possible, but the asking price plus Rashford’s wage is certainly a stumbling block.",
      "“Jaden Sancho would have to drop his wage demands to get a quick move. There’s a relative market value £25 million that is quite appealing to suitors for Sancho, and there are a couple of clubs in Italy that are exploring that deal.",
      "“But Sancho will have to lower his wage demands, otherwise nothing will progress there. So, it will depend how badly he wants a particular club.",
      "“At least from the perspective of suitors with Sancho, the club-to-club negotiation with Manchester United is a little bit smoother because Manchester United are taking the obligation of up to £25 million that was there for Chelsea, and they’re prepared to sell for the same price.",

      "So yeah, the conditions are a £25m transfer fee and a £300,000-per-week wage, or a small loan fee and a great reduction in that wage when United get desperate towards the end of the window and are forced to subsidise his exit. Probably wait for that.",
      "",
      "Tyrell Malacia – Feyenoord\nAs miserable Manchester United footballers go – and there are over 30 of them to choose from – we would suggest Malacia is among the most downcast.",

And we don’t doubt that he has, he’s just not good enough and him being injured or on loan for the majority of his three years as a Red Devil has probably been a blessing.",

      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho – Bayer Leverkusen\nLike Amorim, Ten Hag had the occasional off-field issue with Garnacho, but unlike Amorim, the Dutchman maintained a supportive stance throughout their time together at Old Trafford, citing his age and trajectory to excuse the Argentinian’s ill-advised social media activity while doing everything possible to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "Garnacho went from an unknown to a player linked with £70m transfers in their time together a the club, so Ten Hag was doing something right.",

      "In a squad so clearly all pulling in the right direction under Mikel Arteta, we can’t see him being an issue, and we’re not convinced by the logic of gifting Chelsea another £50m to sign a guy with the potential to be Rashford when the actual Rashford is available for £40m.",
      "We get that Arsenal have been burned by the signing of Raheem Sterling last summer, but it was nothing a few minutes under the cold tap wouldn’t sort, and Rashford’s a very different case.",
      "There was little evidence of there being much left of the Sterling who scored goals for fun at Manchester City when the Gunners took him on loan, while it was clear in six months at Aston Villa that Rashford remains a potentially world-class adjacent winger, as he was when Gunners assistant Albert Stuivenberg was working under Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford.",
      "In the right environment he could do the business to drive a team like Arsenal to major silverware, and not in one or two seasons, as may be the case with Noni Madueke, but next season, when it’s do or die for Arteta.",
      "",
      "Mason Greenwood – Fenerbahce\nIt was Solskjaer who handed Greenwood his United debut but Jose Mourinho called him up to train with the first team some two years after he was denied that same request as regulations ruled out the 15-year-old’s participation – he was well aware of the striker’s quality and it was claimed last month that the Portuguese boss had requested Fenerbahce bosses to look into his signing.",
      "A report on Sunday claimed Al-Ahli have ‘submitted an offer of £60m’ for Greenwood, which will be music to Manchester United ears after club bosses displayed out-of-character cunning by inserting a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal which saw him move to Marseille for £23m last summer.",
      "Whether Greenwood will be attracted by the ludicrous wages remains to be seen, but if he wants more of a balance between pay packet and football quality then a move to Turkey may be in the offing, and Fenerbahce’s big-money move for Jhon Duran shows their desire this summer to close what has been an increasing gap to Galatasaray.",

      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is ‘getting closer’ to completing a move to La Liga giants Barcelona this summer, according to reports.",
      "Rashford left Old Trafford in the January transfer window as Aston Villa took him on loan for the remainder of the season after a falling out with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Man Utd forward was directly involved in ten goals in 17 matches at Villa Park in a successful loan spell that has once again boosted his reputation around Europe, to the delight of the Red Devils.",
      "It is clear that Rashford has to leave this summer unless there is an incredible U-turn from Amorim, who publicly stated in January that he’d rather play his goalkeeper coach than the Man Utd forward.",
      "When asked why Rashford wasn’t being selected, Amorim replied in a press conference: “It’s always the same reason: the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It’s every day, every detail.",
      "“If things don’t change, I will not change. It’s the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player.",
      "READ: Ranking Marcus Rashford’s transfer options: Barcelona? Arsenal? Aston Villa return?",
      "“You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench. But I would put [Man Utd goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn’t give the maximum every day.”",
      "Amorim did admit that he was “really happy” to see Rashford doing well on his loan spell, he commented in April: “All players on loan will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season. The talent of Rashford, Antony… we are really happy because if you put players on loan you want them to perform.”",
      "But there is no future for Rashford at Old Trafford while Amorim in charge with transfer expert Fabrizio Romano explaining over the weekend that the Man Utd forward is now “waiting for options”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Marcus Rashford is basically waiting for options, including Barcelona. Rashford would love to go to Barcelona. Rashford would love to play in Spain. Would love to be a Barca player. Would love to play with Barca players. So Rashford is basically waiting for this option.",
      "MORE MAN UTD NEWS ON F365\n👉 Insiders claim Man Utd have made ‘surprise move’ for a former Everton star in ‘new transfer reality’\n👉 Man Utd set for £30m Greenwood windfall after £60m bid as second signing ‘could be finalised by Monday’\n👉 Solskjaer ‘asks about conditions’ to sign exiled Man Utd star with Juventus swap ‘a non-starter’",
      "“He also has more possibilities, but I expect Barca to try for Luis Diaz again, and then also to have Marcus Rashford as part of the shortlist already since the January transfer window, so Barcelona will now reassess their plans.”",
      "Before he later added on X: ‘New round of talks will start from next week for Marcus Rashford’s future. Rashford has accepted he’s not part of Manchester United and Rúben Amorim’s plans, with options being explored ahead of new chapter.’",
      "Football Insider‘s senior correspondent Pete O’Rourke claims that the only way Rashford moves to Barcelona is on another loan deal.",
      "O’Rourke told Football Insider: “Rashford’s on a very lucrative contract which he doesn’t want to give up.",
      "“Rashford has got this dream scenario of joining Barcelona, but the way that deal’s going be done, it could only be a loan because of Barcelona’s ongoing financial issues and issues registering players.",
      "“These players are due to return to pre-season training at Manchester United next week, but in an ideal world, Ruben Amorim will not want them there.",
      "“He will want their futures sorted out and those unhappy players to be moved on – they’re going to have a busy summer at Manchester United.",
      "“This is going to be one to keep an eye on, it really is. I think there could be a lot of movement.”",
      "However, reports in Spain claim that Rashford is ‘getting closer’ to a move to the Catalan giants this summer as the ‘casting process’ for a new left winger takes shape at the Camp Nou.",
      "A deal to sign Liverpool’s Luis Diaz is ‘becoming increasingly difficult’ and Rashford is ‘ready to do anything to wear the Blaugrana next season’.",
      "Rashford ‘is gaining points to be Barça’s future signing’ with the England international ‘willing to substantially reduce his salary’ in order to complete the transfer.",
      "The Man Utd forward ‘believes the best place to develop is at Barça, alongside Lamine Yamal, to earn a place in the England squad for next summer’s World Cup’.",
      "While the Red Devils have a new asking price of ‘between €45 and €50 million for their player, while Barça won’t pay more than €40 million for Rashford’.",

      "Manchester United have been boosted by a ‘leak’ out of Serie A claiming the Red Devils can pay for a top striker target in ‘two instalments’.",
      "The Red Devils have so far only managed to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.5m from Cerro Porteno, and are said to currently be focused entirely on prising Bryan Mbeumo away from Brentford.",
      "They’ve seen two bids rejected for the 25-year-old, the latest of which is said to have matched the fee paid for Cunha, with the Bees holding out for £65m for the Cameroon international, who is keen on the move to Old Trafford but perhaps not as desperate as the United bosses would like.",
      "Fans won’t have been hugely encouraged by reports on Sunday claiming the club is considering a move for free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin to solve their striker woes, but Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport has provided them with a much-needed boost.",
      "A report from the same publication last week claimed United are ‘always vigilant’ over former Everton striker Moise Kean and that the Red Devils ‘are regularly in touch to monitor the situation of the 2000-born player’.",
      "In 44 appearances for Fiorentina last season, Kean racked up an impressed 25 goals and three assists, and that report claimed United are ‘one of the favourites’ to sign Kean and ‘the charm of the Premier League and Old Trafford could tempt the former Juventus player, who would also be guaranteed a top player’s salary’.",
      "Kean has a release clause of £44m which previous reports have suggested United were considering triggering in a bid to beat Saudi Pro League clubs to his signing, but it’s now claimed they could pay that fee in two instalments, making the transfer even more appealing to the cash poor Premier League side.",
      "‘Based on leaks from Fiorentina, it’s possible to pay the clause in two instalments. So, anyone who wants to buy Kean can spread the payment’, the report states.",
      "That news may well be a timely boost for Red Devils fans, who are faced with the reality of their club missing their own ‘internal deadline’ to sign Mbeumo, assuming the deal isn’t done late on Sunday night or in the early hours of the morning before they begin pre-season training on Monday.",

      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",

      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Kyle Walker is ‘close’ to completing a ‘shock’ move to a rival Premier League club in a ‘significant coup’.",
      "A former Chelsea defender has offered his thoughts on Liam Delap, suggesting he ‘can shine’ with the help of ‘elite’ players like Cole Palmer.",
      "Joao Pedro has joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m. Will Alexander Isak be among them soon?",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",

      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
