      "Manchester United's interest in striker Benjamin Sesko has led to speculation of a swap deal involving Rasmus Hojlund. RB Leipzig star Sesko has emerged as Ruben Amorim's top forward target this summer ahead of Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko has long been admired by the Red Devils, catching their eye even before his move to Red Bull Salzburg. Now, having set the Bundesliga alight at 22 with Leipzig, the club are reportedly in for him once again.",
      "Talks are supposedly underway, and a fee in the region of £70million has been mooted as the Slovenian superstar's price tag. United already spent big on a No. 9 when they signed Danish ace Hojlund from Atalanta in 2023, and it is now suggested that the 22-year-old could be included in a potential swap deal at a dramatically cut price.",
      "The Athletic report that Leipzig are one of several parties interested in taking on the out-of-sorts Hojlund, and the prospect of some form of swap deal including Sesko has been raised, though it looks unlikely at this stage.",
      "Although the 22-year-old cost the Red Devils £72m, they would have to fork out a cash sum alongside their player to secure Sesko's services in any potential swap deal.",
      "The report states that United acknowledges internally that Hojlund's market value would be nowhere near what they paid for him and currently stands a little under £45m. This is a drop of £27m in just two years since his big-money move to Old Trafford.",
      "In light of Sesko becoming United's top striker target and competition for minutes potentially becoming scarce, Hojlund was questioned about his Old Trafford future and responded bullishly.",
      "The Dane claimed he wishes to remain in Manchester and grapple with any prospective recruit for gametime, making any swap deal unlikely, unless United wish to cash in on a star whose worth has plummeted.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens,\" declared Hojlund.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "\"I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "United are believed to be Sesko's priority over Newcastle but a deal is far from a foregone conclusion. Leipzig want a fee of around £65m, plus add-ons and a sell-on percentage for the Slovenian star.",
      "Amorim will likely have to sell before United can make a big enough offer to tempt the Bundesliga side. Hojlund has not been told he is up for sale and United could raise funds for Sesko through the sales of Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, who are all being linked with moves away for significant fees.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford's new Barcelona colleagues have already spotted a personality trait that the striker felt was misjudged during his stint at Manchester United. Rashford completed a season-long loan switch to the La Liga champions, who possess an option to make the transfer permanent.",
      "The 27-year-old clocked up more than 400 outings and claimed five trophies with United before determining that his destiny lay elsewhere from his childhood club. After spending time at Aston Villa last campaign, Rashford is savouring the chance to make his mark at Barcelona.",
      "However, Barcelona defender Jules Kounde has already observed that Rashford appears to be slightly quieter than other members of the squad. The England international previously admitted to feeling misunderstood at times during his United career, having had his character regularly questioned by fans and big-name pundits.",
      "\"He's a bit introverted, but he's really enjoying himself, and feeling more and more comfortable,\" Kounde said of Rashford to Diario Sport. \"I think he is happy. He is smiling a lot. He is happy in the field.",
      "\"He reminds me a little of myself. He's a bit introverted, but he's enjoying himself a lot, and I think he's feeling more and more comfortable. Everyone has welcomed him very warmly. He's talking to everyone.",
      "\"I think he's very comfortable. As I speak English, I'm trying to help him as best I can, but I think everyone is doing that.\"",
      "Kounde's remarks mirror what Rashford revealed to journalist Henry Winter last December regarding his personality and how he is perceived: \"I do feel misunderstood, but I'm fine with it. I'm a very simple person. I love football. That's been my life from the beginning.\"",
      "That wasn't the first occasion Rashford had pondered how others view him. The England star described himself as an introvert whilst discussing how he had navigated challenging periods during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "\"If I'm honest honest, a part of me doesn't mind it when people doubt me,\" Rashford wrote for The Players' Tribune in February 2024. \"When everyone is telling me they love me, I get suspicious. I know the way the world works. I had to become a man really young. Always had to rely on myself.",
      "\"Whenever I've been in my darkest of places, and it feels like half the world is against me, I tend to go off by myself for a couple days and reset, and then I'm fine. I think it goes back to me as a kid dribbling all over the street on my own until it was so dark that I couldn't see the ball anymore and I could hear my mum shouting for me to come home.",
      "\"That's just me being an introvert, needing my space to reset. Other times, when that hasn't worked, I've found someone to talk to.",
      "\"Sometimes that's the way to do it. But every single time I've been down, physically or mentally, I always feel like that's when I turn it around and play my best football for United and England.\"",
      "Rashford made his Barcelona debut against Japanese outfit Vissel Kobe last week, coming off the bench for 33 minutes before being substituted. The United loanee most recently came on at half-time during Barcelona's thrilling 7-3 triumph over FC Seoul on Thursday, setting up the final goal scored by former Manchester City ace Ferran Torres.",
      "During his unveiling as a Barcelona player, Rashford reflected on leaving his boyhood club: \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\" he said. \"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",
      "\"Football is the same as life. Not everything goes as simple as you may have thought. This is my next step and next chapter. I'm fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.\"",

      "Chelsea star Nicolas Jackson has insisted \"I have no competition\" at Stamford Bridge as speculation links him with a move away from the club.",
      "The forward has been strongly tipped for a move to Manchester United, who are desperately seeking more firepower for the new season after Ruben Amorim grew frustrated with a lack of clinical finishing from Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "There have even been suggestions of a swap deal between Chelsea and United for Jackson and Alejandro Garnacho, who has fallen out with Amorim.",
      "Jackson had a solid season for Chelsea last term as he netted 10 times in the Premier League and chipped in with another three goals in the UEFA Conference League - scoring in the final as the team beat Real Betis 4-1 - notching 13 in 37 games in all competitions.",
      "But there have been demands from fans and pundits for Jackson to score more goals and Jackson now appears to have slipped down the pecking order after Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap for £30m and Joao Pedro from Brighton for £60m, with the latter starring in their FIFA Club World Cup triumph.",
      "Jackson, however, has now hit back at the suggestion that the club's new signings meant that he had a battle to be first choice up front under Enzo Maresca and claimed every player \"has their role to play\".",
      "\"Competition? I have no competition,\" he told DSports TV. \"We’re all here to help the club. Everyone has their role to play. I’m on a mission. It’s up to the coach to make his choices. I focus solely on my work.\"",
      "Jackson was coy on his future and said he was focused on playing for Chelsea as things stood, saying he had no control over any \"changes\" that could come.",
      "\"I’m a Chelsea player,\" he said. \"The future belongs to God. If there are any changes, you’ll know. For now, I’m focused on my preparation. It’s football, there are ups and downs. Last season we won two trophies. There were difficult moments, moments of glory. Every season is like that. But the most important thing is to stay focused, to learn, and to grow in the face of adversity.\"",
      "Jackson has netted a total of 30 goals in 81 appearances since joining Chelsea for around £32million from Villarreal in 2023, including 17 in his first season. Despite links to United, it's understood the Red Devils have ruled out a move for Jackson because Chelsea are demanding between £80m and £100m - and have since pressed on with a move for Red Bull Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But with Villa demanding £60m for 29-year-old Watkins, United have prioritised Sesko's signature given that he will cost roughly the same price, but represents better value for money as he is five years younger.",

      "New Arsenal man Viktor Gyokeres has refused to follow his agent in criticising former club Sporting CP for how they dealt with his summer move. The 27-year-old's Premier League switch was dragged out until last week, with clashes over a gentleman's agreement and a hefty fine issued.",
      "Gyokeres, having established himself as one of Europe's finest goalscorers with 97 in 104 appearances for Sporting, always looked destined to make a big switch this window. He joined the Gunners last weekend for a fee rising to £63.7million, having also been courted by Manchester United, who he chose to snub.",
      "Yet, the deal was not simple, as Gyokeres's Sporting departure was a drawn-out affair. The club refuted a supposed gentleman's agreement allowing the Swede to leave for less than his release clause, and the saga that ensued saw him fined for a training camp absence.",
      "Jonathan Chalkias, who works alongside Gyokeres' agent Hasan Cetinkaya, hit out at Sporting this week, claiming that they showed the striker little respect, but Gyokeres himself has not followed suit.",
      "Speaking to Swedish outlet WTV, Chalkias claimed that former Sporting chief Hugo Viana, who left for Manchester City, would have honoured the much-discussed gentleman's agreement to let his client leave more simply for a lesser sum.",
      "\"It was a mess,\" he began. \"There was a gentleman's agreement with the previous sporting director. If Hugo Viana were still at Sporting, the deal would have been done in an hour. Everything was written, we didn't have time to start a legal battle.",
      "\"I don't understand how a player who scored so many goals and won three trophies didn't deserve more respect. The sacrifices we made were the turning point for the deal to happen.\"",
      "The gentleman's agreement dispute was later followed up with Gyokeres being fined £306,000 – his salary for July – after he refused to report back for pre-season training in an attempt to speed up his departure.",
      "However, Gyokeres, speaking to the same network after his move to Mikel Arteta's side was sealed, insists that he does not need to lash out verbally, grateful that the ordeal is over.",
      "\"I don't need to throw mud at anyone,\" began the Swede, who made his first appearance for the Gunners against bitter rivals Tottenham on Thursday in Hong Kong. \"I don't need to say what others have done or decided.",
      "\"I don't do that, even though there are people who seem to need to tell others how to behave. I'm not like that. As a footballer, you always strive to reach the top. I felt ready to take the next step, and I believe many people at the club expected that before the season ended.",
      "\"I didn't find it strange that this desire came up this summer. I don't think it came from our side either. Besides, my agents work for what's best for my career, so there was some clash of interests, but that's part of football.",
      "\"It's been quite demanding mentally,\" he continued. \"It's been hard, but it also makes us stronger. Of course, I may have questioned it a few times, but I always believed it would happen. So it was that balance over those weeks that made everything quite difficult, but now it's even more enjoyable to be here. I feel very relieved and happy now.\"",

    "body": [
      "When Rasmus Hojlund scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United in December 2023 it bought to an end a wait that had spanned more than 1000 minutes. The relief around Old Trafford was evident.",
      "However no striker signed for more than £70million should have their first strike met with a feeling of relief. Instead there should be a sense of inevitability about them finding back of the net. A feeling of that being a sign of things to come.",
      "Think back to Erling Haaland's brace on his debut for Manchester City at West Ham, for example.",
      "In Hojlund's first season his goals constantly seemed like it was him justifying his price tag and Erik ten Hag's continued show of faith in him. But after scoring in England's top flight it looked as if the Dane was finally up and running.",
      "His strike against Aston Villa began a run of games that saw Hojlund score seven times in six outings. United's investment in the young frontman was done with an acceptance he would grow and develop, he wasn't the finished article. Nearly two years on though and the development simply hasn't been what was anticipated, needed or wanted.",
      "Hojlund, following his purple patch in early 2024, has never again scored in successive games. With each passing game he's looked like a player operating with less and less confidence every time he takes to the pitch. The aura that exists around prime Premier League marksman like Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak simply isn't present in the United No 9.",
      "Ten Hag once said about the 22-year-old: \"He has the resilience and the calmness, and to perform under that stress. He doesn't have any moment that he wants to give up. No, he keeps going every time.\"",
      "That resilience is seriously being tested now. 12 months ago United added Joshua Zirkzee, which was not a glowing endorsement of the club's belief that Hojlund could provide the goals they needed. Again they're in the market for more firepower.",
      "On the face of it, its hard to blame Ruben Amorim, who saw his side scored just 44 times in the league last season. He acknowledged that Hojlund was struggling in the final third, but attributed that to being a team problem, not an individual one.",
      "That said, for all Amorim's defence of his player, the Dane's haul of four league goals was bettered by full-backs like Marc Cucurella and Josko Gvardiol. The question United have to answer is just how long can they wait for Hojlund to ignite, if he is going to at all.",
      "The history of football is littered with players who needed a bit of patience before they became the players they had threatened to be. United's ambitions dictate that they need players, especially those in key positions, to be producing now and Amorim's own grace period is running out.",
      "In recent weeks Ollie Watkins has been cited as a target, now Benjamin Sesko is the man they want with initial talks held. A price tag has been quoted and Amorim has not given any guarantee that Hojlund will be a United player beyond the summer, stating \"I don't know what is going to happen.\"",
      "The Dane himself though is determined to fight for his place and prove his worth, welcoming the addition of a new striker to compete with even if that is likely to see him fall down the pecking order.",
      "Man Utd appearances - 95",
      "Premier League goals - 14",
      "European goals - 11",
      "FA Cup / Carabao Cup goals - 1",
      "He said: “I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "If a week is a long time in football then 18 months is a few lifetimes. In February 2024 United saw off West Ham 3-0 at Old Trafford, a game in which Hojlund was on target. But it was the celebration that followed Alejandro Garnacho's goal that had those in Manchester purring.",
      "The Argentine reeled away and sat himself on the advertising board. Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo wandered over and followed suit with the image of the trio - all young, thriving and seemingly with their best days ahead of them - appearing to give a snapshot into the future of the club.",
      "Today, Garnacho is up for sale having angered numerous senior figures in Manchester. Mainoo has been linked with a lucrative move away as Amorim said he is \"so good sometimes but he can be better.\" And Hojlund is now seemingly fighting for his future.",
      "The message may well be, seize your moment, or watch it pass you by.",

      "The Red Devils made it two wins from two in the Premier League Summer Series when they beat the Cherries 4-1 in Chicago, having already put West Ham to the sword on Sunday. Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring after eight minutes, with Patrick Dorgu adding another before half-time.",

      "Williams was not initially expected to travel to the US in light of an anticipated loan move, yet Amorim is now reaping the rewards after he reversed this decision, having taken a real shine to the English talent.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Williams, who scored twice during the second half of last season on loan at Cheltenham Town, was expected to be excluded from United's pre-season tour.",
      "This decision was reportedly made as a plethora of League One clubs were interested in taking Williams on loan. However, head coach Amorim changed his mind late on after taking a liking to the wideman.",
      "\"It was last minute,\" Williams told the club's website after Thursday's victory. \"I was kind of told I wasn't [going] and then I was. I remember just not jumping around the bedroom, but I was buzzing.",
      "\"I've been trying to train well as these guys are the best players I've ever trained with, know what I mean? To be around it and be learning every single day is a real blessing and I'm just thankful for it all.\"",
      "Williams failed to see gametime in the Red Devils' 2-1 victory over West Ham in New Jersey at the weekend, but made an immediate impact at Soldier Field and cut an exuberant figure post-match.",
      "\"It's mad, I can't believe it,\" he declared. \"It still hasn't really sunk in, to be honest. It's a dream come true and I'm so happy right now. I'm thinking about all the moments, all the hard work I've been through.",
      "\"You know, I feel so blessed and so happy to be given this opportunity. To score, it's mad. I can't even explain how I am feeling, to be honest. I already messaged my dad. He put in so much hard work, he's sacrificed everything for me and my little brother to do this.",
      "\"I was straight on the phone, messaging him, [saying] I can't believe I just scored. He was like: 'I told you.' Because we were kind of manifesting it for some time now. For me to finally take this experience, and actually go ahead with it and score, it's a crazy feeling.\"",
      "While it is still likely that Williams will be shipped out on loan after pre-season concludes, Amorim may have been given something to think about with this cameo, especially considering the winger's following admission.",
      "\"Obviously, I want to stay here and, obviously, my long-term goal is to play for the first team,\" added 19-year-old Williams. \"It'd be a dream.\"",

      "Leverkusen won the Bundesliga in 2024 with Alonso's three-at-the-back approach reaping rewards. Ten Hag's preference throughout his career has been for a back four - an approach which helped him reach the Champions League semi-finals with Ajax and win two domestic cups with United - but things are proving trickier in Germany.",
      "It hasn't helped that Ten Hag has been forced to rebuild after the loss of some key players. Jeremie Frimpong and Jonathan Tah were the first to seal moves away, with Florian Wirtz and Granit Xhaka since following suit.",
      "After a humbling defeat to a Flamengo Under-20 side in his first pre-season game, Ten Hag oversaw a victory over Bochum on Sunday. With the new season drawing closer, though, a return to an Alonso-style back three appears inevitable.",
      "Sporting director Simon Rolfes has said he held conversations with Ten Hag over the tweak, telling Bild: \"I believe it's a good system, that we have great stability in it and that we have the players for it. It makes sense to put many of the players on the pitch.\"",
      "Swiss midfielder Xhaka, one of Alonso's important signings ahead of the 2023-24 title campaign, has returned to the Premier League with Sunderland. \"I'm very proud to be here. When I spoke to the club, I was excited and I felt the energy, and the mentality that all the people and players have,\" the former Arsenal star said.",
      "\"It's exactly what I wanted, and I have a very good feeling. We are back to where this club needs to be, and we want to stay here to write our own history. I feel that I'm ready to help the team with my experience but with quality as well.\"",
      "Ten Hag has brought in a number of new faces, including former Premier League stars Jarell Quansah and Mark Flekken. Quansah made his debut in the weekend win over Bochum, as did fellow new arrivals Ibrahim Maza and Christian Kofane.",
      "Leverkusen have also spent £30m on Malik Tillman, with the United States international joining from PSV Eindhoven. \"This club has always played great football. But in the last four or five years Leverkusen have grown enormously and become attractive to a lot of players throughout Europe,\" the former Rangers loanee said.",
      "\"I want to win something. That was my aim in Glasgow and in Eindhoven and it remains my aim here,\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund says he is not fazed by Manchester United’s search for a new striker and has backed himself to prove his worth. United are pushing to sign RB Leipzig’s £70million-rated forward Benjamin Sesko, to replace Hojlund as Ruben Amorim’s first-choice striker, with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins also a target.",
      "But Hojlund, signed from Atalanta for £72m two years ago, said he would welcome any new competition, claiming it would “sharpen” him rather than deflate him. Asked if he had received any assurances from the club about his position, Hojlund said: “Nothing so far.",
      "“I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens. I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "“I'm starting to develop and become even better at the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "United suffered their worst Premier League campaign last season, finishing 15th, with Hojlund managing only 10 goals in all competitions, including a 21-game stretch where he failed to find the back of the net.",
      "The Denmark international, who scored the opener in United's 4-1 victory over Bournemouth at Chicago's Soldier Field to continue their winning run on their US pre-season tour, admitted he fell way short of expectations last season.",
      "“I think after last season it's been a bit rough and I've tried to sharpen myself over the course of the holidays and I feel very, very good,” said Hojlund. “Obviously it was a tough season for us all. I think I should have done better, I think everybody knows.",
      "“But I also think it's a team thing, that we're going to be better now. I think we've shown now in these two games that we're progressing in the right way and looking forward to what's coming. When I came [to United], Anthony Martial was there as well.",
      "“He had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time. That's just part of it - you're not going to tell me that I shouldn't be playing, because I want to play every game.",
      "\"But I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning, but I feel I've matured a lot and I feel like I'm ready for what's coming.”",
      "Hojlund revealed the close bond he has developed with United and Denmark team-mate Patrick Dorgu has helped him cope with the tough times he has faced in the last two years.",
      "“We have a very good relationship,” said Hojlund. “There's only one year between us and we have a lot of common friends. We come from the same sort of area in Denmark as well and we're really starting to bond.",
      "“I also had a very, very good bond with Christian Eriksen and with Victor Lindelof, but there was a bit of an age gap. It becomes a bit like big brother and little brother, whereas me and Patrick seem a bit more equal in terms of age as well.”",

      "Benjamin Sesko could be the solution to Manchester United's goalscoring woes in the new season if the Red Devils are able to beat Newcastle United to the punch for his signature. The RB Leipzig striker has impressed in the Bundesliga at the tender age of 22.",
      "He has managed 39 goals in 87 games for his current club, whom he joined in 2023. As a result, a number of Premier League clubs have registered an interest in the Slovenia international this summer, with United and the Magpies doing battle at present to secure his services.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who currently leads the line at Old Trafford, has failed to live up to the £72million fee United agreed with Atalanta for him two years ago, finding the back of the net a mere four times in 32 Premier League appearances last term. However, the blame for United's lacklustre 15th-place finish last season isn't solely on Hojlund, with Newcastle legend Alan Shearer explaining how link-up play has been a real issue for the Red Devils for years.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day back in 2023 while Erik ten Hag was in charge of United, Shearer was particularly critical of Antony's service to Hojlund, highlighting how something was \"drastically wrong\" in terms of how the players communicated and operated as a team. He explained: \"Antony into Hojlund, six passes in what five games?",
      "\"All season, [Alejandro] Garnacho, five passes, that should be happening per game, nevermind five or six games. There is something drastically wrong and they are never going to score goals until they improve on that.\"",
      "At the time of Shearer's analysis, Hojlund had also received the fewest passes of any Premier League forward in 2023/24, further cementing how team-mates were failing to find the young Dane.",
      "However, an elite recruitment specialist now claims Sesko could be the answer to the qualms faced in the red half of Manchester long before the arrival of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking about Sesko's strengths, the anonymous source told the BBC: \"One of his strengths is getting the ball quickly. He can hold it, hold defenders off, he can give it to the winger, he can give it to the 10. He's good in front of goal. He has a good attitude. He is relentless.\"",
      "However, the expert also warned that as Sesko is still shy of a finished product due to his age and levels of experience, he may not be an instant impact at Old Trafford, and may need time to shape himself in the English top flight. They added: \"You wouldn't expect him to hit the ground running straight away, but in six to 12 months he will be fine and you've got yourself a very good player.\"",
      "While Shearer has insisted that United's passing game in the final third needs a major revamp, he may find himself bittersweet at the prospect of them signing Sesko, given his ties to Newcastle who are also vying for his signature.",
      "With Liverpool target Alexander Isak's future with the club thrown into question as the Swede looks to explore his options away from St. James' Park, the Magpies are on the hunt for a fresh No. 9. However, they may have to look elsewhere as Sesko has reportedly prioritised a move to Manchester rather than Tyneside. United have initiated talks with hopes of striking a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought that Sesko will be permitted to make his way to United if the side can meet Leipzig's valuation of their talisman, which is thought to be in the region of £60m to £70m plus add-ons.",
      "Sesko isn't the only star that Manchester United and Newcastle have battled over this summer either, with The Sun suggesting that both clubs are also exploring the possibility of bringing VfB Stuttgart striker, Nick Woltemade, to the Premier League.",
      "The 23-year-old has been on Bayern Munich's radar all summer, but with the Bavarians recently securing a £65.5m deal with Liverpool for Luis Diaz, they may now abandon their pursuit and leave the door open for another battle between the north east and the north west.",
      "Valued at £40m at present, Woltemade impressed with Die Roten last season, bagging 17 goals and three assists in 33 outings. He also shined bright at this year's UEFA European U21 Championship, clinching the top scorer award with Germany with six goals to his name.",

      "Tom Brady was left fuming with what he deemed to be a “f***ing stupid” opinion from a Birmingham City aide during David Beckham’s visit to St Andrew’s last season. Birmingham, where NFL legend Brady is a minority owner, came up against Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney-owned Wrexham in what was dubbed the ‘Hollywood Derby’ in League One.",
      "Brady, having bought a minority stake in the Blues in 2023, jetted to the UK to watch the clash last September. The seven-time Super Bowl winner invited his good friend and English football icon Beckham to watch it alongside him at the stadium.",
      "Birmingham clinched a 3–1 win over Wrexham in that fixture, which featured prominently on the new fly-on-the-wall Amazon Prime Video documentary titled ‘Built in Birmingham: Brady & the Blues’.",
      "The five-episode docuseries is modelled after Reynolds and McElhenney’s own highly successful ‘Welcome to Wrexham’ on Disney+.",
      "During the second of those episodes, Brady is seen on camera ahead of playing host to Beckham. Before the Wrexham game, Brady suggests to co-owner Tom Wagner that they should organise a gift bag with a club sweater, hoodie, scarf and a hat for the former England captain.",
      "But an aide to Wagner says that the move would be considered a faux pas given Beckham’s lack of affiliation with Birmingham, having only played for Manchester United during his time in England.",
      "The former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback then snaps back with: “That’s f***ing stupid! Give him a gift bag to take home! It’s a sweet thing. He doesn’t have to wear it.”",
      "At one point, Brady in true American fashion, also says: “Wrexham, we’re coming for your a**,” before Beckham explains a chorus of Birmingham City chants aimed at Wrexham by informing him: “Your fans are singing about sheep s****ers. That’s what they say about Welsh people!”",
      "Brady also meets Wrexham co-owner McElhenney, making the odd decision to present him with a personalised Blues shirt bearing No. 12 and ‘McElhenney’ on the back.",
      "Upon receiving it, the ‘It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia’ star jokes: “What am I supposed to do with that?”",
      "Both Birmingham and Wrexham went on to secure automatic promotion to the Championship last season. The Blues won the title with an EFL record of 111 points.",
      "Meanwhile, Wrexham finished second on 92 points, becoming the first team in EFL history to earn three successive promotions. Their newly-formed rivalry will be on display again this season when they face each other in the Championship, having both spent big in the summer transfer window.",

      "Signing Benjamin Sesko could present Manchester United with an all-too-familiar issue this summer. Former Red Devil Louis Saha has outlined the potential pitfalls which can come with relying on youngsters in crucial roles.",
      "Talks for United to bring in RB Leipzig's 22-year-old frontman Sesko have accelerated since Viktor Gyokeres' transfer to Arsenal was confirmed. However, some fans may feel concerned at the prospect of another relatively inexperienced recruit spearheading the club's attack.",
      "The Red Devils have had a succession of up-and-coming talents leading their line in recent years. Rasmus Hojlund, who turned 22 in February, and Joshua Zirkzee, who turned 24 in May, are among the latest examples up front.",
      "Sesko has now moved above the much more tested Ollie Watkins in United's summer wish-list pecking order. With Sesko seemingly open to joining too, despite interest from Newcastle who may need to replace Alexander Isak, it could spell trouble for the likes of Zirkzee and Hojlund – the latter of which Amorim couldn't even guarantee on Thursday morning would stay at Old Trafford beyond this summer.",
      "It shows the huge pressure that comes with being United's striker, and Champions League-winner Saha made it clear, when speaking to Betway, how it's a lot for young men to handle.",
      "He said: \"Having the striker gives you confidence because whenever you’re not playing well, he’s able to actually score his own goals. He’s able to score the goals that are important and can change the nature of the games.",
      "\"It is very important that the manager finds this with the striker, and that also gives the right platform for Hojlund or Zirkzee to perform as well, because there is not so much pressure only on their shoulders.\"",
      "There's a risk of the same sequence of events unfolding around Sesko should things not work out as hoped for the striker in England. The Slovenian has impressed in Germany and notched a career-best 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last term, but there's a sentiment among some United fans that a more hardened recruit, like Aston Villa talisman Watkins, is required.",
      "On the profile needed, Saha added: \"When you look at Europe, it’s not easy to find a No. 9 that is very consistent with his own ability to create his own chances. We’ve seen that Victor Osimhen has signed for Galatasaray, Benjamin Sesko was maybe signing for Arsenal, or now maybe United. Those targets are extremely interesting.",
      "\"You need those goals, you need that charisma at the very top of the field because it brings the confidence to the other players. I think those profiles are extremely important.\"",
      "Asked whether United have missed that character and confidence from their attacking players in recent years, Saha replied: \"I call it players with the balance of arrogance and humility. We had Ibrahimovic. I always felt that this guy was the perfect fit, because he had this charisma, arrogance, people would call it, but it’s not arrogance, it’s just confidence and hard work.",
      "\"The guy worked really hard and helped a lot of the players around him, so this is the type of character we needed. When you give that responsibility to 22-year-old and then 20-year-old strikers, they have to prove a lot of things. It’s extremely hard.",
      "\"I thought that it was a mistake to put that on the shoulder of Hojlund or Zirkzee and say, 'You are the guys, you are the No. 9 and you should go and score 30 goals to get us in the Champions League and challenge for the title.'\"",
      "Highlighting his concerns, Saha said: \"I think it was a mistake and it needs to be addressed because this is how we build the confidence of youngsters. You can’t progress because you have had five or 10 good games. It’s not enough. You need a season or two, and then a real understanding of how things can change in a click. So all those things have been asked of youngsters, and I think it wasn’t fair.\"",
      "There's of course no guarantee that even older players won't face issues. However, one would hope a more proven record in other top teams or leagues would lead to a higher guarantee of on-field results.",
      "In that sense, United could make a mistake should they entrust their frontman role to yet another gem with fairly minimal top-level experience. It's understood Leipzig are demanding north of £70million for Sesko's signature, a similar risk to the Hojlund investment that has yet to bear much fruit.",

      "The young Dane capitalised on a quick free-kick from Mason Mount, shrugged off his marker, burst forward and coolly finished past Bournemouth keeper Djordje Petrovic, marking his first goal since his February move from Lecce.",
      "After an impressive outing against West Ham United in New Jersey last weekend, the 20-year-old was a persistent threat on the left, adopting the attacking positions that Amorim demands from his wing-backs.",
      "Amorim, delighted with Dorgu's development during his first pre-season with United, told MUTV: \"He is 20 years old. He looks more and more like he belongs in Manchester United.",
      "\"That is hard to do at 20 years old. He is so powerful, he is getting his technique in his game, he is defending so well, he is pressing so well, so I am really impressed with Patrick.\"",
      "While Dorgu could be set for a long future at United, Amorim has hinted Hojlund could be heading for the exit door. The Dane has seen striker Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrive this summer, while interest has been lodged in RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim is pleased with Hojlund's pre-season work but could not offer the 22-year-old any reassurance over his future. He said: “I’m really happy with Rasmus, but I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "“The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He’s connecting really well with the team. He’s improving.",

      "The Sporting CP midfielder is reportedly on United's wish list as they look to bolster the engine room. And Eriksen, who departed this summer following three years at Old Trafford, might assist his former club in securing his own successor.",
      "That sum could prove too steep for United to complete a deal this summer, though Eriksen's sway might tip the scales in their direction. Hjulmand, who was also on United's wish list last summer, regards his international colleague as a mentor figure, while his existing bond with Ruben Amorim will also strengthen his position.",
      "Despite severing ties with the Red Devils this summer, Eriksen seemed to leave on excellent terms. And he was especially praising of Amorim and his contribution since taking over from Erik ten Hag last autumn.",
      "\"The manager has come in with new ideas,\" said the Danish stalwart in March. \"He's a very honest guy, straightforward, and we're just trying to adapt and get into the system and the habits in his style of play.",
      "\"He's a good manager. With a bit more belief like we had in the second half, we could create chances, commit more people offensively and then we got a few chances.\"",
      "Sporting are set to pocket a tidy profit for Hjulmand should they receive anything close to his release clause, whether that materialises this summer or in the near future. The defensive midfielder arrived in Portugal from Italian side Lecce during the summer of 2023, with the club securing his signature for a reasonable £17m fee.",
      "He claimed the Primeira Liga title under Amorim during his debut campaign at the club before being handed the captain's armband in July 2024. That appointment demonstrates the admiration Amorim holds for the player and his leadership abilities, and it seems the sentiment goes both ways.",

      "\"Adding Matheus brings something different again and I think it worked well in the last game,\" said Mainoo. \"You can stitch him up [with a poor pass] and he'll deal with it! He loves playing under pressure and in one against ones, so it makes it easier for me.",
      "\"The team's definitely gelled well since we've been back and with the new additions - Diego [Leon], Matheus and Bryan [Mbeumo], it's been really good. It's been good, playing in there [midfield] with Manu [Ugarte], Bruno [Fernandes] or any of them - Casemiro, Toby [Collyer]. It's always good there.",
      "\"It's been good. It's very hot out here and in New Jersey, but it's been nice. Training's been good, we got the first win against West Ham so we're all feeling good.\"",
      "Reflecting on his rapid rise for United and England, Mainoo said: \"It's been a cool journey and I'm just looking forward to the season to see what happens.\"",
      "United, who could yet add to their ranks with a swoop for Benjamin Sesko, continued their pre-season progress with a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday. Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu and Amad all found the net before youngster Ethan Williams got in on the action.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side play their final Premier League Summer Series match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. After that comes a home friendly against Fiorentina, and then the Premier League opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Rivals Arsenal have been busy in the transfer market themselves. They completed a £63.7m swoop for one-time United target Viktor Gyokeres, while also signing Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Christian Norgaard and Cristhian Mosquera.",
      "“There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn’t a hard choice. I chose Arsenal,” Gyokeres said, and he will now make his Premier League debut against his former Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has already been impressed by the Swede, saying: \"“I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far. Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves.",
      "He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher, and intelligent as well. You can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality and the willingness.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have turned their attentions away from Ollie Watkins and towards Benjamin Sesko. However, fresh developments could yet allow them to come back in for the Aston Villa star.",
      "Villa's asking price on Watkins appeared to be a sticking point, with United seeming reluctant to part with the best part of £60m. Unai Emery's side were reluctant to sell, given their lack of back-ups in attack, but they are now eyeing up alternatives.",
      "Curiously, Villa's main attacking target is Sesko's team-mate Lois Openda. According to reports in Belgium, the Premier League side have been exploring a move for Lois Openda for a number of months, with the interest said to be mutual.",
      "Belgian international striker Openda has scored 41 goals across two seasons as a Leipzig player, but could be available after the German club missed out on European qualification. However, it is being reported that Villa will need to sell Watkins before they can bolster their attack..",
      "Villa have had a quiet window so far, with Dutch starlet Zepiqueno Redmond their only attacking recruit. They weren't able to seal permanent moves for loanees Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, leaving them with fewer options in attack.",
      "Sesko and Watkins are both valued by their respective clubs at around £60million. However, United are more prepared to spend that kind of money for a player more than seven years younger than the England star.",
      "Slovenia international Sesko, who turned 22 in May, has 39 goals across two Leipzig seasons. He was also a target for Arsenal before they swooped for Viktor Gyokeres, while Newcastle could yet pounce if they lose Alexander Isak.",
      "While United wait to add to their attacking ranks, their current crop had a chance to show what they can do in front of goal. Ruben Amorim's side are in the United States for the Premier League Summer Series, where they made it two wins from two with a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth.",
      "United scored twice in each half, with Rasmus Hojlund among those to find the net. They play Everton over the weekend before rounding off their pre-season campaign with a home friendly against Fiorentina on August 9.",
      "Danish striker Hojlund is one player who could yet be sold to raise funds in a summer which has already seen United splash out more than £100m to bring Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford. “I’m really happy with Rasmus. But I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market,\" United's head coach said.",

      "The summer transfer window will soon overlap with the Premier League season. The campaign is a little over two weeks away, and several sagas still need to play out.",
      "Manchester United and Newcastle could yet involve themselves in a transfer battle for Benjamin Sesko, who looks like he could well leave RB Leipzig. The Red Devils want a new No 9 and the Magpies too could go after the young striker.",
      "Newcastle will only do so, however, if Alexander Isak does leave St James' Park after expressing a desire to look elsewhere. If he does leave then his likely destination will be Liverpool, who would then have spent upwards of £300million in one summer and potentially broken the British-transfer record twice in a matter of weeks.",
      "Arsenal continue to chase Eberechi Eze after landing Viktor Gyokeres with Mikel Arteta hitting the market hard this summer. There are also a number of individuals who need to iron out their futures - Jadon Sancho and Jack Grealish among them.",
      "Manchester United have told RB Leipzig they will lodge an official bid for Benjamin Sesko shortly - if the striker is up for the move.",
      "The Red Devils want a new No 9 and are prioritising a move for Sesko, who has also been linked with Arsenal and Newcastle this summer.",
      "And it's now been claimed by Fabrizio Romano that United are ready to act.",
      "But they will only make their move IF the Slovenia star will say yes to a switch to Old Trafford...",
      "Manchester United wonderkid Jack Moorhouse is heading to Leyton Orient.",
      "The attacking midfielder will join the O's on a season-long loan.",
      "Orient enjoyed tremendous success in the loan market last season, which culminated in them reaching the League One play-off final.",
      "Jadon Sancho is ready to slash his wages IN HALF to secure a return to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "The Manchester United star made his name at Dortmund before heading to Old Trafford in the summer of 2021 for £73million.",
      "But after falling out of favour at United, Bild say Sancho is ready to take a huge pay cut to return to Germany.",
      "Jorrel Hato is heading to Chelsea for his medical after a deal worth £37m, plus add-ons, was agreed with Ajax.",
      "Hato is expected to pen to paper on a seven-year contract to become Chelsea's fourth summer signing.",

      "Wantaway Newcastle striker Alexander Isak previously outlined his ambitions to win titles, with Premier League champions Liverpool gearing up to make their move. The Reds have wasted no time in sharpening their squad for the upcoming season with a series of high-profile and expensive acquisitions – and they still want the Swedish striker through the doors at Anfield.",
      "With Liverpool ready to show their hand, Isak's head has been turned. But maybe the clues to Isak's future were there all along, as speaking back in March, the 25-year-old communicated his desire to land the game's biggest trophies.",
      "While he acknowledged his commitment to the Magpies, his words suggest that Isak is perhaps looking for a level of success – and a contract – that Newcastle simply cannot supply right now, with the club having been hamstrung by PSR (Profit and Sustainability Regulations).",
      "\"I've said many times, I don't really look too much or think too much about my future,\" Isak said four months back. Making clear his desire to win top-level silverware, he continued: \"But yeah, I've said I'm happy here and we are contenders for titles, which is what you want to win as a football player.",
      "\"The chances are there (to win things). Yeah, as I’ve said, I’m not thinking about the summer, but that will be a talking point when the season is finished. No [contract] talks have been held yet. I have high ambitions. I am trying to create my own history at Newcastle. Happy with what I have done so far but always looking forward.\"",
      "Crystal Palace have announced that former Arsenal defender Rob Holding has left the club.",
      "Holding joined Palace from Arsenal in 2023, but managed just one first-team appearance and spent the second half of last season out on loan at Sheffield United after he was frozen out by Oliver Glasner.",
      "Arne Slot believes Liverpool have conducted 'great business' in making on profit by selling Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich. The Colombia international completed a £65.5million to the Bundesliga giants and signed a deal until 2029 at the Allianz Arena.",
      "\"Luis is a player we won the league with and there’s a reason we won it with him because he’s a very good player,\" said Slot. \"It’s always disappointing to see someone like that leave, to a certain extent.",
      "\"But on the other hand, we’ve sold him for a lot of money and, as you probably know even better than I do, this football club brings in unbelievable signings over the years, but part of the strategy is also that once in a while we have to sell someone.",
      "\"I think we did great business by bringing in Lucho for a number of years and then selling him for a very good profit. Lucho was a player who was a joy to work with because he always had a smile on his face every single day. I will remember him as someone who was a joy to work with and a Premier League title winner.\"",
      "Chelsea star Kendry Paez has completed a season-long loan move to Strasbourg.",
      "Paez only joined Chelsea after he turned 18 in May, although a deal was struck to sign him from Independiente del Valle back in 2023.",
      "Nottingham Forest have signed Dan Ndoye from Bologna, with the forward putting pen to paper on a five-year contract.",
      "\"I am really happy to have signed for the club,\" Ndoye said. \"It is a really exciting time at Forest and I knew straight away that I wanted to be a part of the project. It’s a really ambitious team with a fantastic history and I can’t wait to get started.\"",
      "Forest's chief football officer Ross Wilson added: \"Dan is an exciting new addition to our squad and a player we have tracked extensively over a long period of time. We are delighted that he joins Nottingham Forest and continues his own ambitious journey here with us.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund says he is not fazed by Manchester United’s search for a new striker and has backed himself to prove his worth. United are pushing to sign RB Leipzig’s £70million-rated forward Benjamin Sesko, to replace Hojlund as Ruben Amorim’s first-choice striker, with Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins also a target.",
      "But Hojlund, signed from Atalanta for £72m two years ago, said he would welcome any new competition, claiming it would “sharpen” him rather than deflate him. Asked if he had received any assurances from the club about his position, Hojlund said: “Nothing so far.",
      "“I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens. I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "“I'm starting to develop and become even better at the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "The Italian have already seen a loan with an obligation to buy offer rejected by their Serie A rivals.",
      "Both Sterling and Grealish are tipped to move on this summer having fallen down their respective pecking orders and their clubs, Chelsea and Man City, are open to facilitating their sales.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is open to leaving PSG this summer, but equally not ruled out spending another season in the French capital with the European champions.",
      "The Italian goalkeeper is entering the final year of his contract and Man Utd are reportedly among those interested in his services.",
      "PSG decision to sign Lucas Chevalier from Lille has left him unsettled and cast doubt over his future in Paris despite some stellar performances last term.",
      "Alexander Isak is now training away from Newcastle and is working on his fitness at former club Real Sociedad.",
      "The Liverpool target was left off the Magpies' tour to the Far East due to a thigh injury but it is understood he has made it clear he wants to leave St James' Park this summer.",
      "Still the decision to train in Spain seems bizarre when he should be undergoing rehab at Newcastle's facilities in the North East. Liverpool have yet to make a bid but are aware it will take a British transfer record offer to sign the Sweden international.",
      "Former Man Utd star Gary Pallister told BetVictor: “Could we see James McAtee at Man Utd? I watched him for England’s under 21s and he looks a terrific player. I've seen him bits and bobs in the Man City first team and he's like a Cole Palmer, isn't he?",
      "“He's that good a player and he doesn't want to wait around and wait for his chance. Phil Foden did. I think he could have gone down the same route as Palmer and now maybe McAtee. But he had the patience to see it out and got his rewards.\"",
      "Jorrel Hato is heading to Chelsea for his medical after a deal worth £37m, plus add-ons, was agreed with Ajax.",

      "The two clubs have been in talks for a number of days, which led to Hato being left out of Ajax's squad for the Como Cup final on Sunday.",
      "Chelsea are also in talks to sign Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres agent has taken aim at Sporting Lisbon for creating a \"mess\" for the Swede as he sought to achieve an exit from the Portuguese champions. The lengthy saga ended with him joining Arsenal, but not before plenty of animosity.",
      "But Jonathan Chalkias, who works alongside Hasan Cetinkaya to manage Gyokeres, claims former Sporting chief Hugo Viana, who left to take up the same role at Manchester City, would've honoured the agreement to let him go and avoided the messy exit.",
      "He told Swedish network WTV: \"It was a mess. There was a gentleman’s agreement with the previous sporting director. If Hugo Viana were still at Sporting, the deal would have been done in an hour. Everything was written, we didn’t have time to start a legal battle.",
      "\"I don’t understand how a player who scored so many goals and won three trophies didn’t deserve more respect. The sacrifices we made were the turning point for the deal to happen. They offered Gyokeres to Real Madrid, they even made headlines with Man United, but there was a commitment with Arsenal.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim said he cannot guarantee Rasmus Hojlund will stay at Man United next season - after the club made their move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United have prioritised a a move for RB Leipzig’s £70m-rated striker Sesko, with Amorim admitting he cannot give Hojlund any guarantees over his future.",
      "“I’m really happy with Rasmus,” said Amorim. “But I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that’s the most important thing.\"",
      "Liverpool remain keen on landing Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace but do not agree with their £40million valuation given he is available for nothing come next summer. They also want to avoid a lengthy saga should they pursue the centre-half.",
      "Guehi has no desire to sign a new deal in south London and could leave for free in 12 months. If Liverpool are to move for the defender then it will revolve solely around the price being quoted.",
      "The Reds have already spent £200m this summer but are keen on making additions to their defence. Guehi has a lot of positives going for him but those on Merseyside have little interest in negotiations that drag on for weeks, reports the BBC.",
      "Aston Villa have identified RB Leipzig star Lois Openda as a replacement for Ollie Watkins should he join Manchester United. Belgian striker Openda scored 13 goals for Leipzig last season after notching an impressive 28 in his first term following his club-record £37m move from Lens in 2023.",
      "A report from Belgium states that Villa have been in contact with the 25-year-old's representatives for several months. However, it adds that Villa would have to sell Watkins before signing Openda.",
      "Arsenal are set to miss out on Salford City's teenage star Will Wright, who instead looks poised to head to Liverpool. The Reds have agreed a deal worth £200,000 with the League Two side for the 17-year-old striker, who scored more than 50 goals across age groups last season.",
      "Wright underwent a medical on Tuesday and a deal to take him to Anfield is now in its final stages. The Gunners were previously favourites to sign the young star, but appear to have missed out with those in the north west winning out.",
      "Oliver Glasner has pleaded with the Palace board not to sell any of their star players such as Eze, warning that it could derail their season. The 27-year-old is wanted by Arsenal, who've made him their priority as we approach the final month of the summer.",
      "Marc Guehi is also being linked with a move to Liverpool after the Palace captain entered the final 12 months of his contract. Eze, meanwhile, is tied down until 2027 but has a £68m release clause.",
      "Alexander Isak is reportedly set to become one of Liverpool's top earners if he seals a move to Anfield this summer.",
      "The Reds have been strongly linked with a move for the Sweden international, who could cost as much as £150million after his sensational displays in front of goal last season, scoring 27 times.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, Isak would earn around the same amount as new signing Hugo Ekitike, who has just penned a deal worth £250,000-a-week.",
      "Man United could have to spend upwards of £70million if they want to land Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig as talks are held over signing the striker. The Slovenian has now emerged as their main target in attack with Ruben Amorim still keen to land a No. 9 this summer if he can.",
      "Sources in Germany have indicated there is a gentlemen’s agreement between Leipzig and their young striker to let him leave for a fee of £60m to £70m plus add-ons - but only to select clubs. The German side have consistently shown they will part with their top players for the right fee and do not have the benefit of Champions League revenue this term.",

      "United have previously been linked with Sesko, back when he was at Red Bull Salzburg, and are now ready to come to the table again. Amorim has already seen Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha arrive at Old Trafford, but neither would ideally like to play through the middle as the team's focal point and would be better suited playing behind a natural striker, leading to their interest in Sesko.",
      "Sources in Germany have indicated there is a gentlemen’s agreement between Leipzig and their young striker to let him leave for a fee of £60m to £70m plus add-ons - but only to select clubs. The German side have consistently shown they will part with their top players for the right fee and do not have the benefit of Champions League revenue this term.",
      "Sesko has proven himself as a goalscorer and nobody in his age range has scored more goals in the past two seasons across Europe. United's fellow Premier League side Newcastle could still come to the party should Alexander Isak choose to move on.",
      "Sesko was also the subject of serious interest from Arsenal earlier in the window before the north London club pivoted and went for Viktor Gyokeres instead. Despite United spending upwards of £130m, those in Manchester are confident they could still purchase the Leipzig man.",
      "Amorim has made more firepower a priority following a season where United finished 15th and scored just 44 times. The club also looked at Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins but the club insisted the England striker was not for sale and the Red Devils chose not to put in a bid.",
      "They have sanctioned the loan exit of Marcus Rashford and none of the forward options who were present last year were at all prolific in the final third. Amorim has also cast doubt over the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who has continued to struggle in his two years with the club.",
      "“I’m really happy with Rasmus,” said Amorim. “But I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that’s the most important thing.",

      "Hojlund scored the opener in United’s 4-1 win over Bournemouth at Chicago’s Soldier Field in the second game of their US pre-season tour. United have prioritised a a move for RB Leipzig’s £70million-rated striker Sesko, with Amorim admitting he cannot give Hojlund any guarantees over his future.",
      "He said: “I’m really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that’s the most important thing.",
      "“The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "“Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he’s playing better.",
      "“I'm really happy with the players that we had last season. They are improving. We look like a different team today. Let's continue with that. I'm really happy with Bryan [Mbeumo], Matheus [Cunha], even Diego [Leon]. You can see it. He's a smart guy. He's a guy that came from Paraguay to come to the Premier League. He's really powerful, so I'm really happy with the three guys.”",
      "On United’s win, which came courtesy of goals from Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and Ethan Williams, Amorim said: “I think it was a good game. I think we played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve on in the last season.",
      "“I think we had better possession compared to the last game, so the players are listening. Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the game can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions. It was a good test.",
      "“We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson, Semenyo. One against one, Luke Shaw was also really strong. It was a good day. It was just a pre-season game. But the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.",
      "“More than the results, it's the way they are playing. I think it's really important. People cannot see that. I think they are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other. Not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",

      "Manchester United maintained their winning start to their US tour, defeating Bournemouth 4-1 at Soldier Field in Chicago.",
      "Victory saw Ruben Amorim's side avenge their 3-0 defeat at home to Bournemouth at Old Trafford last season, with Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and Ethan Williams scoring the goals in wet and wild conditions in the windy city.",
      "United's win also means they are the only side with a 100 percent record in the four-team Premier League Summer Series, heading into the final round of games in Atlanta on Sunday. Here are five talking points from United's comfortable win in the windy city.",
      "On the day United made their move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, the player currently leading their attack, Hojlund, provided a timely reminder of his goalscoring ability by plundering the opener.",
      "Hojlund toiled last season, managing just 12 goals in all competitions, which was one of the reasons United made recruiting a proven goalscorer their top priority in the summer transfer window, with Sesko and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins their top targets, having seen Liam Delap go to Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool.",
      "Hojlund may find himself surplus to requirements next season, if United get Sesko or Watkins, and may ultimately end up leaving or going out on loan, but his work-rate and desire cannot be questioned, even if he is not prolific enough to lead the line for United.",
      "After spending most of last season a hostage to injury, featuring in just 12 of United's 60 games, the new campaign is one of huge significance for Luke Shaw. Playing at left centre-back, Shaw started superbly, executing a perfectly-timed robust tackle early on to dispossess Antoine Semenyo as the Bournemouth attacker surged towards the United goal.",
      "Shaw played with confidence thereafter, surviving a scare on the half-hour when he went down after Semenyo had trodden on his left foot. Shaw came out on top in their personal battle and coming through the game and playing so impressively was a huge boost for Amorim, who described the 30-year-old as “world class” in an interview earlier on the tour and who intends for him to be a key player for him next season.",
      "“I really like this formation,” said Shaw ahead of the game. “But, honestly, I don't mind wherever the manager wants me to play. I'm happy to play anywhere. I've been playing left-centre back this pre-season and I'm just really happy to be doing this pre-season as I missed the last pre-season.”",
      "Another United player with a point to prove, after two injury-plagued seasons, was Mason Mount who, like Shaw, was handed a starting place. Like Shaw, Mount played with intensity and purpose, linking up well early on with Bruno Fernandes, the pair exchanging passes before the United skipper saw his shot saved.",
      "Mount played a role in United's opening goal after eight minutes, his clever run off the ball dragging a defender away and opening up enough space for Patrick Dorgu to pick out Rasmus Hojlund, whose glancing header beat Djordje Petrovic in the Bournemouth goal. In the 25th minute, Mount's quick-thinking led to United's second goal, after he spotted Dorgu's run and took a swift free-kick, scooping the ball high for him to run on to and dispatch beyond Petrovic. There was certainly enough in Mount's first-half display to suggest that, if he can stay fit, he can be influential for United next season.",
      "Amorim made six changes from his starting line-up from United's 2-1 win over West Ham in New Jersey in their US tour opener. The most notable absentee was Matheus Cunhaw, who was not even included in the match-day squad, after complaining of fatigue in the build-up to the game against Bournemouth.",
      "“We need to assess all the players,” said Amorim. “We have to be careful with everyone. He's available for the next one. Matheus felt a little bit fatigues. He was ready to play, he wants to give everything, but we gave to be careful.”",
      "Dorgu, signed from Lecce in the January window for £25million, was a revelation in the first-half, setting up Hojlund for the opening goal, then scoring the second, racing on to a quickly-taken free-kick from Mount and displaying impressive strength to withstand pressure from an opponent before turning the ball in.",
      "If Dorgu can take this form into the new season, he will nail down the left wing-back slot in Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation. As well as a goal and an assist, he also had a 100 per cent completion on 21 passes in the first-half and won all of his duels.",
      "Amorim said of Dorgu: “It's impressive. He's 20 years old. He looks more and more like he belongs in Manchester United, and that is hard to do at 20, but he's so powerful, he's getting technique in his game, he's defending so well, he's pressing so well. So I’m really impressed with Patrick.”",
      "Soldier Field, the 61,000-capacity home of NFL team the Chicago Bears, was not even half-full for United against Bournemouth and the game that preceded it between West Ham and Everton. But as the weather worsened and swirling winds were accompanied by driving rain, with no cover in any of the four stands, the attendance became even more sparse as fans decided to leave early because of the conditions.",
      "The hardy ones left behind putting on ponchos to protect themselves from the relentless showers that fell. After the searing heat of the previous week, in which the temperatures in Chicago hit the high 90s, the weather more akin to Manchester was no doubt welcomed by the players.",

The Red Devils wasted no time in getting their first signing of the line, snapping up Wolves forward Matheus Cunha on the first day of the window by triggering his £62.5million release clause.",

      "Aston Villa have identified RB Leipzig star Lois Openda as a replacement for Ollie Watkins should he join Manchester United. Belgian striker Openda scored 13 goals for Leipzig last season after notching an impressive 28 in his first term following his club-record £37m move from Lens in 2023.",
      "A report from Belgium states that Villa have been in contact with the 25-year-old's representatives for several months. However, it adds that Villa would have to sell Watkins before signing Openda.",
      "Manchester United are considering making a move for Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope after they agreed a deal to sign Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton. Pope, 33, has entered the final year of his contract at St James' Park and Eddie Howe's faith has waned.",

Manchester United are said to be demanding £30m for the Brazilian winger and don't want to loan him out again after his successful spell with Betis last season.",
      "Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo add that Antony, 25, doesn't want to stay in the Premier League. That's despite rumoured interest from Newcastle and Nottingham Forest.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund insists he wants to stay at Manchester United and fight for his place.",
      "Hojlund scored twice in United's 4-1 thrashing of Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday night, hours after it emerged United were advancing with a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United attempted to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town at the start of the summer but he opted to join Chelsea. Viktor Gyokeres also snubbed United in favour of Arsenal and Aston Villa have resisted United's advances for Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko has now emerged as United's likeliest striker recruit, with Newcastle United resigned to missing out on the Slovenia international. Sesko, 22, is only a few months younger than Hojlund but United are determined to have a new No.9 up front.",
      "Inter Milan enquired about Hojlund in the summer and United head coach Ruben Amorim refused to give assurances that Hojlund would stay at the club.",
      "When asked if United had updated him on his future, Hojlund said: \"Nothing so far. I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Hojlund admitted he has struggled with a lack of support up front at United. When he joined from Atalanta in July 2023, Anthony Martial was recovering from a hamstring injury and the injury-prone Frenchman did not play for the club again after December 9 that year.",
      "United signed Joshua Zirkzee last year but the Bologna forward was ill-suited to the centre forward role and an alternative in the second half of the season was the 17-year-old academy graduate Chido Obi.",
      "\"Obviously when I came, Martial was there as well,\" Hojlund explained. \"He had a lot of injuries, so I obviously had to take a lot of the game time. That's just part of it, you're not going to tell me that I shouldn't be playing because I want to play every game.",
      "\"But obviously I could have done with some help in terms of sharing the games a bit, especially in the beginning. But I feel like I've matured a lot and I feel like I'm ready for what's coming.\"",
      "Amorim stressed how \"happy\" he is with Hojlund's form in pre-season. The Dane struck the post inside the first minute against West Ham in New Jersey on Saturday before his two-goal performance against Bournemouth.",
      "Hojlund's movement in the penalty area has been widely criticised and he revealed he has been studying videos to improve it.",
      "\"We played a lot of games last year so it was hard for me to implement anything into the game for me, especially training on the pitch,\" he added. \"So it's been a lot of videos, especially with my movement in the box and also the timing of my runs has been very important.",
      "\"I think after last season it's been a bit rough and I've tried to sharpen myself over the course of the holidays and I feel very, very good.",
      "\"It was a tough season for us all. I think I should have done better, I think everybody knows. But I also think it's a team thing, that we're going to be better now. I think we've shown now in these two games that we're progressing in the right way and looking forward to what's coming.\"",
      "Hojlund is adamant he scored twice against Bournemouth after Amad's shot grazed his shin. \"It is definitely mine,\" Hojlund laughed. \"I can't help it. It's just... it is my goal. The ball touched my shin so I'm going to definitely claim that one!\"",

      "With Rashford's United career clearly over and the club desperate to raise funds for further incomings, a permanent exit for Rashford was the priority when the window opened.",
      "It soon became evident a permanent move would not be found, with United forced to take the next best option in allowing Rashford to move to Barcelona on a season-long loan with an option to buy. €30million (£26m) is claimed to be the fee required for the Catalan club to sign Rashford next summer, but if they opt against - as Aston Villa did just a few months ago - it leaves United in a sticky situation.",
      "The move is something of a gamble on United's part, but judging by the events unfolding on the other side of Manchester, it's already looking like a gamble that was worth taking.",
      "United's plan to move Rashford on always had the chance of being complicated by Jack Grealish's situation at Manchester City. Granted, Rashford and Grealish are very different players, but the two forwards were always likely to be linked with big hitters across Europe.",
      "It was imperative United moved swiftly to avoid complications later in the window. They've done just that, albeit without sanctioning the permanent exit they'd hoped for, while City are left to search for a suitor for a player who wasn't even named in their Club World Cup squad.",
      "The longer Grealish remains a City player, the weaker their hand will be in any negotiations.",
      "Unlike Rashford at United, Grealish took part in City training this week as the players returned from their summer break, but that looks like being the closest Grealish will come to playing alongside his teammates again.",
      "Grealish needs to find a way out of the Etihad as much as City need to offload him. It's far from an ideal situation, and one United have avoided with Rashford.",
      "Even if they've been made to wait for the sale they wanted.",

      "Manchester United were at rock bottom after losing in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat against Tottenham at the Estadio de San Mames meant a trophy was not salvaged from the club's worst season in 51 years. It also meant there would be no European football at Old Trafford in 2025/2026.",
      "Pundits suggested the consequences would be grave, while the fans of rival Premier League clubs said United would struggle to attract new signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "Although United must make a few high-quality signings to consider the summer a success, the window isn't unfolding like some pundits and rival supporters suggested it would.",
      "\"Who would want to join United?\" they asked. Matheus Cunha was linked with other clubs, but the Brazilian wanted a move to Old Trafford and his transfer from Wolves was straightforward.",
      "During Cunha's unveiling interview, he said: “It is the most common phrase that you can say at this moment, but this is the dream come true. Maybe outside, I think maybe my decision, they don’t understand. But when you have always dreamed to play here, it’s easier to pick this decision.",
      "“For me, no-one else is like United. Of course, I know it’s been a hard season for everyone. I think my decision shows what this club is for me, and what I believe this club can be.",
      "“It is hard to find a way to explain this club for me. My house didn’t have the channel to watch the Premier League. My cousin’s house didn’t have the channel. He’s older than me and he supports United and he showed me the way, to start to watch the Premier League and to need to support United.\"",
      "Then Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Brentford for £65million and £6m in add-ons. United said Mbeumo made it clear from the outset his desire to join and never budged from that position, despite the feeling that Brentford wanted the forward to join Newcastle or Tottenham.",
      "Mbeumo was also linked to Arsenal, but again, was adamant about moving to United. “Manchester is a big club. I think it’s a great opportunity. I’m someone who likes a challenge. There is a very good project in Manchester and I wanted to be part of it,\" he said in the USA this week.",
      "\"He [Amorim] said, ‘We are people who like winning, and we want to be the best team’, and of course that’s what we will try to do. It was a very friendly conversation and a constructive one.",
      "\"He explained his project to me, what he wanted to do and I really clicked on that. Of course I spoke to some other managers because I wanted to hear their projects but the Manchester United one was very good for me.”",
      "Old Trafford was another pull. “You want to play on the greatest stages in the world, and Old Trafford is one of them, so being able to play here every two weeks is just big,\" said Mbeumo.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo received interest from elsewhere and both pushed for transfers to United, despite the club having just suffered its worst season in modern history. Why? The answer is pretty simple.",
      "United are a giant football club, one of the biggest in the world, and the attraction of representing a club steeped in rich history and tradition is still enough to turn the head of some players.",
      "That pull can only go so far, of course. There needs to be a project, a convincing manager and big wages offered to attract the best, but this summer has proven United's reputation still means something.",
      "That reputation may also help United sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, despite the striker having been identified as Newcastle's priority target amid uncertainty with Alexander Isak.",
      "Sesko is believed to prefer a move to Manchester instead of St. James' Park. Eddie Howe's side have finished above United for successive seasons, they have just won the Carabao Cup and will play in the Champions League again, but the indication is Sesko prefers a switch to United.",
      "Manchester United have endured a train wreck 12 months - but are still hugely attractive.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, before Patrick Dorgu, Amad and youngster Ethan Williams added gloss to the scoreline. The only blotch on the performance was an own goal from Matthijs de Ligt but it would do little to dampen the enthusiasm for that display.",
      "Away from pre-season, United's main focus is now a move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. The Reds are advancing their approach for the Slovenian after discovering that the pursuit of Ollie Watkins was unlikely to be fruitful.",
      "The determination to sign Sesko has led to questions over Hojlund's future which Amorim addressed in Chicago overnight.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below",
      "Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong has made a decision on his future after previous transfer links with Manchester United.",
      "The Dutch midfielder was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022, having previously been under the guidance of then-United manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax.",
      "Read more here",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United should prioritise a new goalkeeper next in the summer transfer window - but he's wrong.",
      "The Reds' current No.1, Andre Onana, has struggled badly at times since arriving at Old Trafford from Inter Milan in 2023. The Cameroonian was supposed to be an upgrade on a declining David de Gea and yet he has often cost United points rather than rescuing them.",
      "Every side with ambitions to be a top team needs a world-class goalkeeper between the sticks. Onana is clearly not that based on his performances at Old Trafford over the past two seasons.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "New Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo has already given his backing to their potential move for Ollie Watkins - who could become the Reds' equivalent of Mo Salah. Watkins, 29, featured alongside Mbeumo during their time together at then-Championship outfit Brentford in the 2019-20 campaign.",
      "The attacking partnership netted a total of 40 goals as the Bees came agonisingly close to securing promotion to the Premier League, ultimately falling short in the play-off final against Fulham.",
      "Read more here",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United still have work to do in the transfer window this summer.",
      "United are desperate need of a consistent goal-scorer up-front, having netted just 44 goals in the top-flight last season, their lowest total in the Premier League era. After splurging big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the current transfer window, United will need to sell players to finance additional acquisitions.",
      "Read more here",
      "It's already been a busy summer for Manchester United and they're not done yet.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are the marquee signings of the summer so far, and while they will certainly help to sharpen a blunt attack, United still need to sign a centre-forward.",
      "The club are advancing with a potential move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, while Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins is also on their radar. Whatever happens, United need a striker.",
      "With so much going on, here's a look at all of United's transfer business so far this summer...",
      "Jadon Sancho is prepared to take a pay cut to join Borussia Dortmund, the club where he first made a name for himself.",
      "This is according to German outlet BILD who report that Sancho is willing to cut his pay by 50% if it means he can join the Bundesliga side.",
      "With his slashed pay, Sancho would earn around £7m-a-year. This would still put him near the top of the highest earners at Dortmund.",
      "Nicolas Jackson has spoken on his future amid transfer interest from Manchester United.",
      "\"Competition? I have no competition,” Jackson said, via the Metro.",
      "\"We’re all here to help the club. Everyone has their role to play. I’m on a mission. It’s up to the coach to make his choices. I focus solely on my work.",
      "\"I’m a Chelsea player. The future belongs to God. If there are any changes, you’ll know. For now, I’m focused on my preparation.\"",
      "Manchester United have shifted their focus from Ollie Watkins to Benjamin Sesko, but an interesting development may yet see them return for the Aston Villa player.",
      "Villa's valuation of Watkins seemed to be a hurdle, with United hesitant to shell out nearly £60million for the 29-year-old. Unai Emery's team were initially unwilling to sell due to their limited attacking options, but they are now considering alternatives.",
      "Interestingly, Villa's primary attacking target is Sesko's RB Leipzig teammate Lois Openda. Reports from Belgium suggest that the Premier League club have been contemplating a move for Openda for several months, and the interest appears to be reciprocated...",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is aware that he isn't Ruben Amorim's first choice striker and that a new No.9 is bound to be signed this summer according to transfer expert Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBR Football: \"Rasmus Hojlund knows he is not wanted by Man United as first choice, he knows they have been talking to strikers all summer – let’s not forget they were trying for Liam Delap in early July. Now it is Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"United have not directly told him he can leave, and vice-versa, Hojlund has not demanded to leave – but I am told they have talked and he knows where he stands. If Sesko or another new number nine arrives, Hojlund is likely to leave.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim revealed he is happy with his new squad following a busy summer transfer window.",
      "He said after Manchester United's 4-1 victory over Bournemouth last night: \"It's just pre-season, but the feeling with the same players, if I look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team. And that is a good sign.",
      "\"The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals, connecting really well with the team and improving.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to happen until the [transfer] market is closed.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the players I had last season,\" he continued. \"They are improving. We looked like a different team today. Let's continue with that.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Bryan, Matheus, even Diego. You can see it, he is a smart guy. For a guy that came from Paraguay, to come to the Premier League, he's really powerful. So I'm really happy with these three guys.\"",
      "It is easy to understand why some Manchester United supporters have reservations about the club's pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After all, United turned to a young and inexperienced striker in the form of Rasmus Hojlund two years ago to become the focal point of their attack, and it is fair to say that experiment has not gone well.",
      "The Dane, who joined United from Atalanta in August 2023 for an initial fee of £64million, scored just ten goals in all competitions last season, chipping in with just four in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, United have been left with no choice but to prioritise the addition of a new striker this summer...",
      "Juventus will be 'ready on the market' if one of their key wingers leaves, with Jadon Sancho a viable option this summer.",
      "Juventus General Manager Damien Comolli said, via Fabrizio Romano: “We have two of the best wingers in the world like [Kenan] Yildiz and [Chico[ Conceicao, plus Nico who’s an excellent player. If someone leaves, we will be ready on the market.\"",
      "Manchester United are said to be in talks with Gianluigi Donnarumma despite reports attempting to shut down these rumours.",
      "Bundesliga expert Jan Aage Fjortoft shared on X this morning: \"Donnarumma and Manchester United. There were some reports yesterday that this was a non-starter. That’s not correct! Just been told that this process is ON. There are talks going on.\"",
      "The Paris Saint-Germain keeper reportedly has a £34.6m price-tag. United had a loan deal request turned down by Aston Villa for Emi Martinez earlier this month.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund insists he wants to stay at Manchester United and fight for his place.",
      "Hojlund scored twice in United's 4-1 thrashing of Bournemouth in Chicago on Wednesday night, hours after it emerged United were advancing with a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "When asked if United had updated him on his future, Hojlund said: \"Nothing so far. I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens...\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund impressed in Manchester United's 4-1 victory over Bournemouth last night, scoring a goal within the opening 10 minutes.",
      "Despite being heavily linked with a departure from Old Trafford, the 22-year-old revealed post-match that he his ready to fight for his spot at the club and is fine with competition in the striking department.",
      "He said: \"My plan is very clear. That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.\"",
      "Speaking to BetVictor, who offer the latest online casino games, former United defender Gary Pallister has tipped James McAtee to potentially become the Reds' very own Cole Palmer.",
      "Could we see James McAtee at United? I watched him for England’s under 21s and he looks a terrific player. I've seen him bits and bobs in the Man City first team and he's like a Cole Palmer, isn't he? He's that good a player and he doesn't want to wait around and wait for his chance. Phil Foden did. I think he could have gone down the same route as Palmer and now maybe McAtee. But he had the patience to see it out and got his rewards. I understand players wanting to play more, he knows he's talented enough to be playing in a Premier League team, but he's missing out at the moment. So I understand the frustration. Pep Guardiola has always said he would never stand in the way of anybody who wanted to leave. It's just a tough decision for the kid. He obviously loves it at Man City and wants to play there, but when you get into that age and you're not playing and you're that good… you can certainly understand the frustration. Would he come to Manchester United? I don't know. It's the Liverpool and Marcus Rashford situation, it is very difficult to get deals done between two clubs like that.",
      "While on the surface it seems like a wise idea to try and get Saudi clubs to buy unwanted players, in practice it is harder to achieve this goal.",
      "For the most part, this is due to players having ambitions to stay in Europe - not every player is like Joao Felix.",
      "Antony, for instance, has reportedly already turned down a move to Brazil to stay in Europe which will be a concern for the Reds if they were to receive a bid from the Middle East.",
      "According to Football Insider, United are looking into the possibility of selling players to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "While no exact names have been mentioned in relation to being sold, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have all requested to leave Old Trafford.",
      "The Middle East has become synonymous with big wages but now also big transfer fees with Chelsea banking £43.7m for Joao Felix.",
      "One brief worry for United fans waking up this morning is that new signing Cunha was not in the squad that beat Bournemouth.",
      "Fans will remember last summer that Leny Yoro picked up a severe injury during the pre-season tour of the US and United do not need history repeating itself.",
      "Thankfully, Amorim explained Cunha's absence and it is nothing too serious.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "With the pursuit of Sesko now intensifying, that only adds to the speculation surrounding the future of Hojlund.",
      "Since arriving at the club, the Dane has been the first choice centre-forward and whether his performances have merited that position or not is up for debate.",
      "What isn't up for debate is that this move to try and sign Sesko will clearly lead Hojlund to question whether he is best sticking at United and fighting for his place, or moving elsewhere.",
      "Yesterday, MEN Sport brought you the news that Benjamin Sesko was now United's top target in the summer transfer window.",
      "United had been weighing up whether to target him over Ollie Watkins.",
      "However, Villa are adamant that Watkins will be remaining at their club and thus United have decided to turn their attention to Sesko.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Nicolas Jackson has flattered to deceive at Chelsea.",
      "Last season, he averaged a goal every three Premier League matches which is hardly the sort of return that shall spark unparalleled excitement.",
      "He is still at the early stages of his career but is two years older than Sesko.",
      "In truth, choosing not to sign Jackson is perhaps no bad thing.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United currently have no interest in swapping Garnacho with Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "Chelsea are thought to still be interested in a move for Garnacho.",
      "However, there is no desire from the Reds to bring in Jackson as part of that deal.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "If he were to leave after suddenly becoming surplus to requirements, a move to Italy has been highly talked about.",
      "Hojlund's standing in Serie A remains high after his performances for Atalanta.",
      "Inter were credited with interest previously, as have Juventus as they look to replace Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "From the end of last season, talk has been rife about the future of Hojlund with the striker asked on international duty if he was set to leave.",
      "He replied then that his plan was to be at United this season and that was all he is focused on.",
      "This stance has been reflected on the rumour mill too with journalist Fabrizio Romano among those to state that his preference is to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to the assembled media in the US, Ruben Amorim was unable to give any guarantees that Hojlund would be staying at United beyond this summer.",
      "He explained:",
      "I am really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome to the United transfer blog this Thursday morning.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until lunchtime with all the latest United news.",
      "We shall start with reaction to the victory over Bournemouth where the latest on this man's future was discussed...",
      "RB Leipzig are demanding a fee of £64million plus add-ons as well as a sell-on percentage for a deal for Benjamin Sesko, as per The Athletic.",
      "Manchester United have made Sesko their first-choice striker option and want to agree a deal for the Slovenian before the end of the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick has admitted he has been monitoring Marcus Rashford's career for some time now, following his summer loan move from Manchester United.",
      "Speaking in a press conference on Wednesday, Flick said: \"Rashford? I've been following him for many years, ever since he started his career at Man United. We hope he can show his quality this season.\""

The former Aston Villa star faces an uncertain future in Turin with reports suggesting that he could return to the Premier League after leaving for Serie A last summer.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, the 27-year-old will leave the Italian giants this summer, which has sparked fresh speculation surrounding his future. In other outlets, United have been mooted as possible suitors to add reinforcements to their midfield after adding Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to their attacking firepower.",
      "Football Insider claimed in mid-July that United had registered their interest in the Juventus midfielder.",
      "It was reported at the time that they faced competition from Everton who were also reportedly targeting Luiz, despite four years remaining on his contract.",
      "The claims suggest that it comes after the Serie A side began considering their options and were keen to offload the midfielder, preferring permanent offers over a short-term solution.",
      "Speaking to reporters, Comolli claimed that Luiz was forced to apologise after disrespecting his teammates.",
      "He said: “Douglas Luiz disrespected his teammates and the whole group.",

      "As reported by the Telegraph, Chelsea maintain their interest in the United winger this summer, and is said to be the favoured destination for the player this window. The Blues are said to have made background checks on Garnacho, and hold no concerns over his character after being bombed out of the United squad by head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "It is added that Chelsea are expected to make an offer for the winger, but may wait until United’s search for a new striker is over.",
      "The Blues themselves may need to create space in their squad with the sale and loan of attackers. Christopher Nkunku and Armando Broja are expected to leave permanently, while Marc Guiu and Tyrique George could complete loan moves.",

    "body": [
      "With Manchester United in discussions for a new No.9, the incumbent got two goals against Bournemouth. Rasmus Hojlund charged around like a bull in Chicago.",
      "Hojlund's deft header in the eighth minute was smart striker play he is not synonymous with. Bournemouth were seemingly thrown by Patrick Dorgu crossing with his right foot and crossing well. Hojlund neatly helped the ball on its way.",
      "As meaninglessly as these games are judged, they have to be meaningful for the players. That was apparent with Hojlund's celebration, identical to when he equalised at Bournemouth in added time in late April.",
      "His evening did not start auspiciously. He kept his place but his mood was not improved by a recall for Diogo Dalot, fast becoming Hojlund's scourge. Hojlund was demonstrative with Dalot with less than four minutes on the clock, piqued that he had not read his heavy lay-off. Dalot nevertheless congratulated his teammate on his goal.",
      "In the 51st minute, there was a bullish high-ten from Dalot for Hojlund after he was crudely fouled. Hojlund got a similar amount of contact for his second goal yet was not immediately enveloped by his teammates. Amad's shot grazed Hojlund's shin and both claimed the glory. As it stands, it is credited to Amad.",
      "While United are in dialogue with RB Leipzig goalscorer Benjamin Sesko, Hojlund has to view his own situation as win-win. No Sesko means he continues at the tip of the arrow. If Sesko comes in, Hojlund can create a wider market for himself. Inter Milan enquired about his availability at the start of the transfer window.",
      "There was a Danish theme to United's win, with Dorgu notching his first senior goal for the club. Dorgu has been quietly effective and more attack-minded across all three friendlies. A left back by trade, Dorgu is developing into the pure winger that Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system demands of the wide roles.",
      "New Bournemouth goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was flimsy for Dorgu's dink though it was a smartly-worked goal, instigated by Mason Mount's quick-thinking with a quickly-taken free kick. Dorgu invited it with his sudden charge into the final third.",
      "United look fitter than at this stage in past pre-seasons. Every starter bar Harry Maguire, withdrawn at the interval, played for 70 minutes. Maguire's replacement, Matthijs de Ligt, put through his own net late on.",
      "The Premier League opposition in this Summer Series appears to have reinforced United's focus. West Ham and Bournemouth both beat United last season. The intensity and edge about United was best exhibited by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "He sprinted back to block a cross before berating the referee for awarding a corner. Teammates were quick to congratulate Fernandes, unrelenting in his criticism of official Lewis Smith. That was in the 69th minute and marked his final contribution.",
      "Amorim downplayed the strength of the United side against West Ham last week and there were six changes in the Windy City. United still have the wind in their sails, with two wins out of two in the States.",
      "This handsome friendly win was replete with an academy goal from a newbie. Ethan Williams, one of ten substitutes to emerge, scored within two minutes of his first senior appearance. Williams, a winger, has inherited Chido Obi's old squad number and his finish was akin to a striker's.",
      "United were without both of their senior summer recruits as Matheus Cunha sat out the game due to fatigue. He is expected to be fit for the final tour match against Everton on Sunday in Atlanta, where Bryan Mbeumo is scheduled to appear, most likely from the bench.",
      "The main dampener on United's pre-season on Wednesday evening was the Chicago weather. There were more ponchos than replica shirts at Soldier Field and the United players' red replicas were so saturated from the swirling rain they turned blood red.",
      "Luke Shaw was one of the six players recalled, slotting in on the left of the back three. He does not have the durability to be entrusted with the left wing role and he may be at the back of the queue at centre back when Lisandro Martinez ends his rehabilitation.",
      "Amorim generously dubbed Shaw \"world class\" last week. \"He understands the problems I had last season were really tough,\" Shaw said on Tuesday. \"It's something I've not experienced, to be honest. I know I've had a lot of injuries, but it was more mentally how tough it was. It was really tough. I think last season was one to forget really. Like I said, I've had injuries in the past, but last season it was different kinds of injuries.",
      "\"It was horrible. To be fair, it started with a calf and I've never had a calf injury in my life, so I was never used to that. It was just a completely different rehab and stuff. Things just kept happening. It was really stressful.\"",
      "Shaw was anything but with a couple of well-read recovery tackles. He required treatment from the physio following an impact injury but soldiered on at Soldier Field.",
      "So is Hojlund.",

      "Manchester United loannee Marcus Rashford made another strong impression during his second Barcelona appearance after looking bright on his debut.",
      "Just three days after having his temporary switch confirmed, the England international came on at half time against Vissel Kobe before being brought off in the 78th minute with his minutes being managed having just arrived at the La Liga champions.",
      "With more training sessions likely under his belt, Rashford played a full half this time as Hansi Flick's side beat FC Seoul 7-3 as part of their pre-season tour in Asia.",
      "Though four goals were scored while he was on the pitch, Rashford failed to get off the mark - but he did grab the assist for Ferran Torres' late goal with a very smart pass in behind which allowed the former Manchester City man to finish easily.",
      "Prior to that however, the 27-year-old was looking very sharp both coming in off the left and sprinting down the touchline. Just moments after being introduced, he skipped beyond several challenges before firing a powerful effort which was parried clear by the goalkeeper.",
      "No less than five minutes later, Rashford opted for a run in the opposite direction with some jinking step-overs allowing him to get into a crossing position only for an interception to be made which saw Barcelona win a corner.",
      "Considering his impact thus far and the fact that Raphinha and Lamine Yamal are both left-footed, Barcelona may be very keen to keep Rashford beyond the 2025/26 season - if he can continue making a similar impact. If they do choose to activate the buy-option inserted into his loan move, it will cost just €30million (£26m).",
      "Though United would have hoped for more money and for it to come in this summer, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all look set to depart Old Trafford permanently over the coming weeks.",
      "Any funds acquired from a Rashford sale would however, go straight onto their financial books as pure profit with the attacker also having the chance to make an impact at his dream club. That scenario playing out, based on Rashford's first two appearances, currently looks very likely.",

      "Manchester United has just over a month to sign a new striker before the summer transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have so far welcomed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as new reinforcements, but an attacker remains high on their priority list. A number of options are being considered, including Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins, and Sesko.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Manchester United have been in contact with Benjamin Sesko's camp since last week and are also in contact with Red Bull Leipzig.",
      "\"So Man United spoke to both of them and Christopher Vivell is the name to remember. Vivell is the director of Manchester United, who used to work at RB Group then he went to Chelsea for some time and then to United.",
      "\"He has a very good relationship with RB Group and knows Sesko very well, so Vivell is working actively, helping with this deal. Man United are also showing Leipzig the opportunity to include a player into a deal for Sesko.",
      "\"Then we have to see if this player would be open to going to Leipzig because they don't play European football for many years so I don't think it will be easy to include a player in this deal.\"",
      "Addressing Newcastle's interest, Romano added: \"Newcastle are prepared to pay what it takes to Red Bull Leipzig to sign him. Contract terms, salary, commission, transfer fee, whatever.",
      "\"Newcastle are ready to go for Sesko. But this depends on the player and what he wants to do.\"",
      "Asked about a move for an update on Sesko’s potential transfer to Old Trafford following United's 4-1 pre-season win over Bournemouth, Amorim said: \"No. The important thing is Rasmus is scoring goals and connecting really well with the team.",
      "\"We look like a different team today let’s continue with that. I’m really happy with Bryan and Matheus.",
      "\"Even Diego you can see he’s a smart guy for a guy who came from Paraguay to the Premier League it’s a really powerful player I’m really happy with these three guys.\"",
      "Romano also noted that the 22-year-old, who has several options on the table, will take the next few days to meet with his family and agent before deciding on his future.",
      "Meanwhile, Sky Germany journalist Florian Plettenberg provided further insight into the situation. The striker is said to be impressed with United’s approach and their determination to secure a deal.",
      "When the forward signed a new contract last summer, it included a clause allowing him to leave for a 'special' club.",
      "Romano claims the gentleman's agreement between Sesko and Leipzig could see his price tag reduced to between €70-80m plus €5-10m add-ons.",
      "If United were to sign Sesko, his preferred number may not be available. The striker currently wears No.30 at RB Leipzig - a number he also wore at Red Bull Salzburg, but it has already been taken by summer signing Diego Leon.",
      "Sesko previously wore No.21 and No.29 earlier in his career.",
      "While No.21 is currently assigned to Antony, the Brazilian is expected to leave the club this summer. Meanwhile, No.29 remains vacant and could be an option."

      "Dorgu was among a crop of individuals who produced an eye-catching performance, providing the assist for Hojlund's opener before latching onto a quickly-taken free-kick from Mason Mount to score his first goal in United colours.",
      "Dorgu believes he and his teammates are benefitting from the time they are spending on the training ground.",

      "United endured their worst season in 51 years in 2024-25 and the season ended with Amorim telling winger Alejandro Garnacho he could leave after he questioned the Portuguese's decision to bench him in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho remains part of the 'bomb squad' that have been exiled from the first-team squad and ordered to train when their teammates are not on the premises at Carrington.",
      "Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain on United's books as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Rashford for the Manchester derby on December 15 and the latter is unlikely to play for United again. Rashford was disciplined twice by former manager Erik ten Hag, while Sancho was banished from the squad after accusing the Dutchman of lying. Shaw acknowledged there were \"no stragglers in this group any more\".",
      "\"A lot of the time I’ve been here over the last few years it’s been extremely negative,\" Shaw said. \"It can be quite toxic, the environment, it's not healthy at all.",
      "\"We need an environment that's healthy, that's positive, that's got good energy and happiness. I think when you have all those things, you feel free and you express yourself more on the pitch. Things come together and I think, especially this pre-season, I feel like us as a team, I feel like the bond is growing and growing.",
      "\"I feel like in my time here, it's probably the closest I've felt with the squad since I've been here. I think the atmosphere is really good and extremely positive. Hopefully, that can continue.",
      "\"The manager has to [take action] because at the end of the day, he's going to be the one that has his job always on the line. He wants to come in and do exactly what he wants because he's always the one who's on the end of the stick. He wants to come in and do things his own way and stamp his own authority on the club. I think that's the only way you can do it, especially at Man United.",
      "\"I think we need to just all up the level of demands. That's what I think Ruben definitely brings in, is the demands. Especially the mentality. The mentality is a big thing on his lips, really. I think he talks a lot about it. Especially in day-to-day things, with the training. Ruben demands 100% and that's it and he doesn't want anything less.",
      "\"If someone's doing 85-90%, it's not enough for him. I think, especially this year, if you're not doing the right things, I feel like you won't play.",
      "\"And he's not bothered. I think you've seen what he's done in the past eight months with different players and things like that. He doesn't care who the player is. I think if he's not following what he wants, then that's how it should be, and I think rightly so. I think whatever the manager wants, us as players we have to be delivering that. So, yes, we're fully behind that.\"",
      "Shaw, 30, gave a raw interview moments after the Europa League final defeat consigned United to only a second season without European football in 35 years where he said United players had to \"question whether they're good enough\".",
      "The left back has played 27 games in the two full seasons since he signed a four-year contract worth around £200,000-a-week and this is his 12th pre-season with United. Bruno Fernandes, who joined United five-and-a-half years after Shaw, overtook him for club appearances last term.",
      "Shaw, who has started a meagre 20 United games in two years, has no regrets about his post-match candour and admitted he had \"an awful year\".",
      "\"I wouldn't say regret, but I think straight after the game your head's hot and you just say things and you don't think about it,\" he explained. \"I think a lot of people after that final, after that year, had the feeling of you don't know how next season's going to look.",
      "\"I think we have to be open and honest about that. I think none of us were good enough. I think there always has to be that question about what we think and what our plans for the next season. I just don't really know what more to say about that.",
      "\"It's never easy losing a final, especially after the season that we went through. It was even harder to take. Like I said, I think that's why my head was a bit hotter than usual as well.",
      "\"I think I had such an awful year as well. I was just fully angry about everything. I just think that's why I did the interview and said what I said.\"",
      "Shaw joined United 11 years ago and his first few at the club were beset by injury issues and he was publicly criticised by his managers. Louis van Gaal bluntly said Shaw was \"not fit enough\" during his first pre-season in 2014 and Jose Mourinho despaired at how immature Shaw conducted himself.",
      "After Shaw was late for training once, he innocently told staff that his mother had overslept and not woken him up in time. Now Shaw is preaching the importance of punctual timekeeping.",
      "\"I think us as players, especially the more experienced ones, we need to be demanding more from a day-in, day-out basis,\" he added. \"The levels in training, keeping the times of when we're doing this and doing that, making sure no one's coming late or anything.\"",

      "Amorim did not improve results following his arrival from Sporting Lisbon, but he tackled an unhealthy culture at Carrington by laying down the law in the dressing room.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were dropped from the squad to face Manchester City in December. Rashford was permanently exiled, but Garnacho was reintegrated before working his ticket again.",
      "Both players were not included in Amorim's plans for the new campaign and the 40-year-old deserves credit for taking on two talented members of the dressing room. It would have been more convenient to give them further chances rather than outright axing them from the squad.",
      "Amorim wants talented players who possess the right personality and character. Erik ten Hag addressed the culture during his reign, but there was more work to do when Amorim arrived in November.",
      "Some will not want to hear from Shaw given his injury record, but he is an experienced professional and is well-positioned to provide insight, so his selection of the word 'toxic' gave a glimpse behind the curtain.",
      "It feels like United are closer to achieving a healthy dressing room than they've ever been since 2013. Each United manager has tried to foster a perfect culture, but egos have been allowed to fester.",
      "Amorim's work behind the scenes to create an improved culture is just as important as getting tactics right on a matchday because a sporting institution cannot succeed without strong culture.",
      "The feeling of the squad, how players interact with each other and carry themselves away from the pitch is so important. Rashford and Garnacho had let themselves down at times and Amorim deemed that unacceptable.",
      "The raising of standards is a huge positive ahead of the new campaign.",

      "Manchester United's pursuit to sign a new centre-forward appeared to be leaning in the direction of Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins this summer.",
      "However, a swerve on Wednesday has seen the Reds change course and they are now prioritising a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko instead. The 22-year-old is highly thought of by the director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and has already been compared to Erling Haaland.",
      "Were this deal to be confirmed, he would not be the first player brought to Old Trafford in recent years who has been compared to the Manchester City talisman. Rasmus Hojlund was also given this rather unenviable title and suffered last season after a mixed start to life at the club.",
      "As mentioned by our Chief United writer, Sesko is younger than Hojlund but the expectations are still plentiful for the striker. It has been too long since the Reds have had a striker capable of 20 Premier League goals and the Slovenian is being tasked with ending that streak.",
      "But choosing to focus your energy on Sesko instead of Watkins, whether Villa wanted to sell the Englishman or not, speaks volumes for the team which Ineos are trying to build. There was relative security in the idea of signing Watkins.",
      "He is proven in the Premier League and could perhaps continue scoring at Old Trafford. Such a pedigree comes with a price tag and he would have likely cost similar to Sesko despite having just two years remaining on his deal in the West Midlands.",
      "What United are showing is that they are wanting to invest in players that have plenty of potential rather than those who are heading towards the final stages of their career. When those two options are put to Ineos, it appears they would prefer to go with the former rather than the latter.",
      "Considering the situation United are in, the move also speaks volumes as to the standing the club has in world football still. When the Reds lost that Europa League final plenty of people, myself included, questioned whether United could still attract players who are wanted by Champions League clubs.",
      "It seems that fear was unfounded. While Viktor Gyokeres may have gotten away, United have shown they still have that pull which makes some of the top, emerging talent want to join.",
      "Of course, this deal is not yet done and United still have work to do to ensure it is completed - chief of which is making it absolutely certain that the transfer is financially affordable. However, the Reds are looking to make another standout signing in a window which could have easily gotten away from them.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United flop Jadon Sancho has ‘signalled’ his intention to make a significant ‘sacrifice’ to seal his preferred transfer.",
      "Sancho returned to Man Utd at the start of this summer’s transfer window as Chelsea decided to pay a reported £5m penalty fee to send him back to Old Trafford.",
      "The England international had a mixed spell on loan at Chelsea as he did not do enough to earn a permanent move and his future remains in doubt.",
      "The winger has not come close to living up to his £73m price tag since joining Man Utd from Borussia Dortmund and is not part of Ruben Amorim’s plans as club chiefs oversee a significant squad overhaul.",

      "READ: Romano reveals huge Sesko swap boost as RB Leipzig ‘dream’ of ‘damned’ Man Utd star",
      "Sancho clearly feels comfortable at Dortmund as he has produced his best form at the Bundesliga side and a report from German outlet BILD claims he is keen on a ‘return’.",
      "It is even noted that Sancho ‘would be willing to make some sacrifices’ to secure his desired move to Dortmund and would ‘forego’ a huge sum of money to land a move back to the Bundesliga side.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘He has already signaled to the Dortmund management around boss Lars Ricken (49) and sports director Sebastian Kehl (45) that he is willing to forego a lot of salary in order to return to his feel-good club.",
      "‘Sancho hauls in around €16 million per season at the Red Devils. In Dortmund, he would reportedly play for half of his staggering salary. That wouldn’t even put him among the top earners (Niklas Süle at €14 million), but would rank in the upper midfield.’",
      "The report notes United are ‘not interested’ in Sancho, but Chelsea legend Roberto Di Matteo claims he could be “one of the greatest in the game”.",
      "“I think it’s all down to Jadon Sancho. He has so much quality and so much potential to be one of the greatest in the game. I don’t know why he’s inconsistent,” Di Matteo said.",
      "“He went back to Borussia Dortmund and managed to help them to the Champions League final, he showed us again how good he could be. It’s completely down to him. It’s completely down to him what he wants to do with his career.",
      "“Dortmund are a big club, Juventus is even a bigger club in terms of history and titles and they’re always competing to win titles – but it’s really down to his mentality. It’s down to his mentality and his attitude.",
      "“What does he want? Does he want to be a player that is remembered in the history of football or does he just want to keep changing teams every season? It’s down to him.”",
      "Manchester United star Luke Shaw has given his backing to head coach Ruben Amorim and hit out at four Red Devils “stragglers”.",

      "Man Utd are ‘close’ to selling Jadon Sancho to Juventus this summer and the Italian giants have their eye on another Red Devils man, according to reports.",
      "A Man Utd forward reportedly has a ‘full agreement’ to join a European giant with the transfer is ‘increasingly close’ as they also near an agreement with the Red Devils.",

      "16) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",

      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",

Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins.

Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",

McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid.

However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "8) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",

The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow.",

The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle and Liverpool are currently at a stand-off, with Isak in the middle. Newcastle have received no bid yet, and the Reds are holding fire, knowing that time only increases the pressure on the Magpies. They are still intent on digging in, even if it means convincing Isak to stay for one more season, and are unlikely to sanction a sale without having a replacement sorted first. Sesko is their top target, but Man United are also there.. Given Isak left it so late to declare his wishes and Liverpool have already signed a striker in his place, it is easy to imagine this being kicked down the road until next summer.

      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City.

      "They were said to be keen on Bryan Mbeumo, who only had eyes for Manchester United, while Liverpool swooped in ahead of them to sign Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt and United now also look set to beat them to RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Newcastle have made the early running in the race to sign Sesko but Man Utd have since made their move to ‘open formal talks’ in order to get a deal done.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs wrote on X: ‘#MUFC open formal talks for Benjamin Sesko after sending a secret delegation to Germany. Christopher Vivell driving. Ruben Amorim put forward Ollie Watkins. #NUFC remain in the race. Both hoping price drops to €70m.’",
      "Before The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed that Man Utd are now ‘prioritising a move’ for Sesko with the journalist adding that ‘Alexander Isak wanting to leave St James’ Park’ has ‘accelerated the actions’ of the Red Devils to get a deal done.",
      "Former footballer and now journalist Jan Aage Fjortoft confirmed that although Sesko ‘gets what he wants at Newcastle’ – Champions League football, for one – the striker ‘wants Manchester United’.",
      "And transfer expert Romano has suggested Sesko and other players who have turned down Newcastle’s advances are “scared” to join as they don’t want to be denied an exit, as is currently the case with Alexander Isak.",
      "“I think there is a crucial point here. We always see Newcastle signing many players, bringing top players to the club, but it’s difficult to see Newcastle selling players,” Romano said on the Men in Blazers podcast.",
      "“And sometimes some players who are younger and maybe want to develop in a different way, maybe they are scared to go to Newcastle and not having the opportunity to leave the club in maybe two or three years.",
      "“So I think Alexander Isak can be also the opportunity for Newcastle to show that, yes, sometimes you also have to sell your players. You can’t always to keep all of them.",
      "“So I think this is one of the points. Sometimes players are scared to go there because maybe they have to stay there for five years. And some of them in modern football want to leave after two or three years is part of the game.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano has offered Man Utd a huge boost in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko as RB Leipzig “dream” of a swap deal for a ‘damned’ Red Devils star.",
      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative.",
      "Man Utd and Newcastle have both submitted ‘offers’ for Sesko, as a report reveals when the striker will ‘decide’ his future with a third option an ‘unlikely’ possibility.",
      "Man Utd have begun ‘formal talks’ to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig after sending ‘a secret delegation to Germany’, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a ‘deal is on’ for Man Utd to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle this summer.",
      "According to reports, there are four reasons behind Alexander Isak ‘doubting Newcastle United’s project’ as they are targeting three ‘top signings’."

      "The NFL Hall of Famer co-owns the Blues and his damning assessment has been revealed as part of a new Amazon Prime documentary set to air on Friday.",
      "Brady questioned Rooney’s work ethic before passing judgment on a Birmingham squad that was relegated to League One in 2024.",
      "“I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” he said, as per the BBC. “I mean, I don’t know, I don’t have great instincts on that.”",
      "Rooney’s time at Birmingham was difficult from the off having replaced John Eustace who had the Blues sixth in the Championship.",
      "Rooney lost his first game, against former team-mate Michael Carrick, and had to wait until late November for his first win.",
      "The England forward was then given the sack in January having picked up just two wins in 15 games and with the club in 20th.",
      "As for the players, Brady blamed them for Birmingham’s relegation, suggesting they did not put in enough effort to stay up.",
      "“Well we’ve already changed the coach, so it’s really the players because the coach doesn’t go out there and put the ball in the goal,” he said.",
      "“They were lazy, they were entitled and when you’re lazy and entitled, you don’t have much of a chance to succeed.",

      "“Why they’re playing in the Championship and not the Premier League,” Rooney said, “is because… we’ve all passed a ball, kicked the ball and run, but it’s a focus, concentrated for 90 minutes.”",
      "Brady did at least admit some blame, suggesting the new ownership changed too much, too quickly.",
      "“There was some good advice that I got that was like, ‘listen, don’t go in there and make these big, sweeping changes – you guys have time’,” he said.",

      "Liverpool are in the process of what many believe to be the transfer window of all transfer windows in the Premier League era to bolster a title-winning squad. But how does it rank among other excellent summer offerings?",
      "A whimsical, some would say pointless, question that absolutely cannot be answered now before those new Liverpool players have kicked a ball for Liverpool, but that’s not stopped the Premier League website from setting a poll for biased fans of major clubs to torpedo and render almost entirely uninteresting, nor us from reordering said list of windows into the unimpeachable top 11 (why 11? don’t know).",
      "We’ve included the percentages from the poll, which has predictably seen the 2025/2026 windows of two clubs voted for more than the other eight options combined…",
      "",
      "11) Arsenal: 2025/2026 (14%)\nNotable signings: Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard",
      "We wonder whether any of what we assume was a huge majority of Arsenal fans voting for this to rank as the second-greatest Premier League transfer window of all-time also signed the #NOTOMADUEKE petition a few weeks ago, or were #KROENKEOUT before signing the striker reported to be their second choice in favour of a guy who looks like he might join actual Manchester United.",
      "",
      "10) Leicester: 2015/2016 (4%)\nNotable signings: Shinji Okazaki, N’Golo Kante, Gokhan Inler, Robert Huth, Christian Fuchs",
      "Funny this, because without Kante this window wouldn’t be in the top 50, and yet it’s absolutely deserving of a place here because they did sign him, for under £8m.",
      "Okazaki, Huth and Fuchs all deserve their flowers for the key parts they played in the wonderful title win, but without meaning to be too harsh on those individuals, these being the signings made to push them from 14th to 1st does lend weight to the claim that Kante has had the greatest impact of any Premier League signing ever.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea: 2014/2015 (2%)\nNotable signings: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis, Loic Remy, Didier Drogba",
      "Both Costa and Fabregas were wonderful as Chelsea scampered to the title upon Jose Mourinho’s return, with Fabregas’ feeding of the menacing striker a particular avenue of success for a side with few weaknesses; graced by the return of a club legend in Drogba.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves: 2018/19 (3%)\n Notable signings: Raul Jimenez, Rui Patricio, Adama Traore, Joao Moutinho, Diogo Jota, Willy Boly, Max Kilman, Leander Dendoncker",
      "The Portuguese revolution began the year before, with super-agent Jorge Mendes’ mitts all over the the signing of Ruben Neves and appointment of Nuno Espírito Santo, who took Wolves to the Championship title having finished 15th the season before.",
      "And in an ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ but supercharge it sort of way, Mendes set about turning Molineux into the The Algarve of the West Midlands after promotion, somehow (by paying them lots of money) persuading Champions League-level footballers to join and push them to a quite extraordinary seventh-placed Premier League finish after six years away.",
      "",
      "7) Liverpool: 2018/2019 (3%)\n Notable signings: Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri",
      "We wonder if there’s been enough water under the bridge for Liverpool fans to accept that £53m Keita was not a misunderstood genius as the vast majority of them insisted was the case despite the swathes of evidence suggesting he was in fact a massive waste of money, but we guess not.",
      "We reckon that has a lot to do with Michael Edwards getting nearly every other transfer right at this stage to set Liverpool up for success then and now, making it very difficult to accept any sort of failure on his part.",
      "Alisson was deemed by many to be the missing cog which led Liverpool to their long-awaited title a year later, but the signing of Fabinho was also a stroke of genius.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester City: 2015/2016 (4%)\nNotable signings: Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph",
      "We might just have plumped for City’s 2017/2018 over this one, when Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva, Ederson and Aymeric Laporte all arrived, but this was the summer when many a fan baulked at them paying a club-record £54m for a Chelsea flop who went on to become the greatest midfielder the Premier League has ever seen, as well as a mercurial Liverpool winger who then claimed 131 goals and 86 assists in 339 appearances.",
      "",
      "5) Southampton: 2014/2015 (2%)\n Notable signings: Sadio Mane, Shane Long, Dusan Tadic, Fraser Forster, Graziano Pelle, Toby Alderweireld, Ryan Bertrand",
      "This might just have come out on top had Virgil van Dijk been signed this summer rather than a year later, but there’s still a brilliant mix of talent and risk here, most of which paid off handsomely, not to mention one of the ultimate ‘streets won’t forget’ footballers in Pelle.",
      "He got 16 goals in his debut season as the Saints finished seventh under Ronald Koeman, then sixth in 2015/2016 to qualify for the Europa League. All of Mane, Alderweireld and Tadic became Champions League stalwarts after leaving St Mary’s, while Bertrand and Forster made 240 and 162 Saints appearances respectively.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United: 2007/2008 (7%)\nNotable signings: Anderson, Nani, Owen Hargreaves, Carlos Tevez, Tomasz Kuszczak",
      "They joined the champions to create what many consider to be the greatest Manchester United squad – possibly the greatest squad of any team – in the Premier League era, with absurd quality and depth in almost all areas.",
      "Kuszczak, Anderson and Nani were on the bench with Ryan Giggs, Mikael Silvestre, John O’Shea and Darren Fletcher as John Terry’s slip in Moscow handed them their second Champions League trophy, to go with the Premier League title they also pipped Chelsea to that season.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City: 2010/2011 (4%)\nNotable signings: Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov, Jerome Boateng, James Milner",
      "The signings which secured the first trophy of the Abu Dhabi era when Yaya Toure scored the only goal of the FA Cup final victory over Stoke City in 2011, before all of them – with the exception of Boateng – played a major role in their first and most dramatic Premier League title win a year later. You may just remember the trophy-clinching goal.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool: 2025/2026 (39%)\nNotable signings: Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Hugo Ekitike, Giorgi Mamardashvili",
      "Again, we’re well aware how fatuous this is given they’re yet to play for Liverpool, but assuming they sign Marc Guehi or another top centre-back, we’re pretty confident this has indeed been an excellent transfer window for them; they would each have to perform quite significantly below expectations for it to not at least be a very good one.",
      "Arne Slot, Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards have come up with the ingenious plan of identifying the spots in need of strengthening and signing their top targets in each of those positions – it will never catch on. And if Liverpool can break Newcastle and PIF’s resolve to sign Alexander Isak we fully expect them to run away with the league which they look destined to win again in any case.",

      "",
      "1) Chelsea: 2004/2005 (13%)\nNotable signings: Didier Drogba, Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira, Arjen Robben, Tiago, Petr Cech, Mateja Kezman",
      "They spent more money the summer before but their first opportunity to use the Roman Abramovich money was all a bit scattergun; they got their transfer eye in once their first big signing, arguably their most important signing ever – Jose Mourinho – got his feet under the table.",
      "Carvalho and Ferreira were part of the most miserly back four in Premier League history, helping Cech to concede just 15 goals – a record unlikely to ever be beaten – with the goalkeeper consistently one of the best, if not the best, around for the next decade. Robben was close to unplayable in his all-too brief time at Stamford Bridge. And then there’s Drogba.",
      "164 goals in 381 appearances may not put him in the top, top echelons of strikers, but his extraordinary record of nine goals in 10 cup finals more than makes up for that, with his 88th-minute header and winning penalty in the 2021 Champions League final his pièce de résistance."

      "Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City each have two players in our ranking of the top 10 Premier League signings of the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "10) Milos Kerkez (Liverpool)\nWe said ages ago that Liverpool needed a left-back. They listened, and here is Milos Kerkez for £40million – a decent price in this inflated market. While Andy Robertson will always be a cult hero and (at least) a two-time Premier League champion, he was a weak link in an otherwise slick Slot machine.",
      "Kerkez is quicker, younger (22 in November), and frankly better. The Hungarian is an upgrade, and crucially, Premier League-proven. He and Jeremie Frimpong are both strong additions, but Kerkez edges it, partly because Frimpong might fall over if you breathe on him too hard.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed £55million, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "8) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be happening, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured, added composure, and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. They’re doing things a bit differently and we rate it highly.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal.",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",
      "MORE F365 TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Will Liverpool signings Ekitike and Wirtz fall victim to the dreaded Bundesliga tax?\n👉 Sesko, Watkins or Messi to Newcastle? One Alexander Isak replacement per top 10 league\n👉 Chelsea and Liverpool dominate top 10 genius Premier League player sales this summer",
      "",
      "5) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",
      "It’s hard to see Cunha struggling. He’s very, very good at football. But we do fear for him. Because, you know, lads, it’s Man United.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "4) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. Gyokeres has the strength, speed, work rate, and most importantly, finishing ability, to succeed in Our League. Arsenal now have a proper No.9. It’s about bloody time.",
      "MORE: Gyokeres to Arsenal: Bruno Fernandes second as Liga Portugal to Premier League signings ranked",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nNico Gonzalez didn’t automatically become the best midfielder in the world after his big-money January move, so Man City went out and signed Reijnders from a Milan side without Champions League football next season, and what a bloody signing he is.",
      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",
      "Arne Slot said Liverpool’s huge moves in the transfer window this summer have been justified by player sales, suggesting the club has done nothing new.",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool have both found value in the transfer market by underpaying for a couple of players each, while Arsenal have a bargain of their own.",
      "Liverpool and Arsenal are in ‘do or die’ seasons for very different reasons as Mikel Arteta faces becoming ‘the new Brendan Rodgers’…",
      "Florian Wirtz’s father has revealed why the player snubbed interest from Bayern Munich to join Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool breaking the British transfer record twice to sign an elite striker and creator is ‘unthinkable’ but means they should be judged by the Quadruple.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’."

      "The Manchester United push to sign Benjamin Sesko ahead of Newcastle is not being ‘driven’ by Ruben Amorim, who ‘prefers’ an alternative.",
      "United completed the signings of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon early in the window before dragging their feet to get a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line.",
      "A new striker is now their priority, with RB Leipzig’s Sesko emerging as their top target, though Ollie Watkins and Nicolas Jackson are still of interest to the Red Devils.",
      "Newcastle have made the early running in the race to sign Sesko but now Man Utd have made their move to ‘open formal talks’ today in order to get a deal done.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs wrote on X: ‘#MUFC open formal talks for Benjamin Sesko after sending a secret delegation to Germany. Christopher Vivell driving. Ruben Amorim put forward Ollie Watkins. #NUFC remain in the race. Both hoping price drops to €70m.’",
      "Before The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed that Man Utd are now ‘prioritising a move’ for Sesko with the journalist adding that ‘Alexander Isak wanting to leave St James’ Park’ has ‘accelerated the actions’ of the Red Devils to get a deal done.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘Watkins has admirers at Old Trafford but Villa told United early in the window that the 29-year-old is not for sale and are adamant he is staying. The United hierarchy are reluctant to pay what they thought it may have taken for Villa to consider doing business.’",
      "A report on Wednesday claimed that ‘the feeling inside Newcastle is that Sesko is likely to go to Manchester United’.",
      "‘Newcastle are continuing to pursue deals for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Brentford’s Yoane Wissa. However, the feeling inside the club is that Sesko is likely to go to Manchester United, which would be a huge frustration given they are so keen on the Slovenian.",
      "‘That, though, could potentially pave the way for a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, who is on Newcastle’s shortlist. So is Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson, but several others are ahead of him at present.’",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs confirmed in a talkSPORT report that United have indeed ‘opened talks for Sesko’ and have ‘sent a delegation to Germany to meet RB Leipzig officials’, with the 22-year-old ‘favouring a move to Old Trafford’.",
      "Chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves ‘arrived a few days ago’ as United are ‘aware they have to move fast’ to beat Newcastle to the Slovenian, with both Premier League clubs ‘believing they can get a deal done for €70m [£60m].",
      "It’s claimed the move for Sesko is being ‘driven’ by head of recruitment Christopher Vivell, with Amorim ‘preferring’ Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sesko is one of two active options for Manchester United along with Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, though talkSPORT understands Ruben Amorim would prefer the latter.",
      "‘Villa don’t wish to sell the England striker, but United may still persist with talks and even test that resolve with a bid.",
      "‘They have not yet ruled out making a formal offer, albeit one below Villa’s £60m valuation.",
      "‘There remains internal debate at United as to whether to opt for proven Premier League experience or a younger No.9 with a high ceiling such as Sesko.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano has offered Man Utd a huge boost in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko as RB Leipzig “dream” of a swap deal for a ‘damned’ Red Devils star.",
      "Man Utd fans may have to settle for another year of Rasmus Hojlund up top after Ruben Amorim suggested he was happy with the Dane leading the line.",
      "Romano has explained why he thinks players are “scared” to sign for Newcastle as top target Benjamin Sesko makes his ‘final transfer decision’.",
      "Man Utd and Newcastle have both submitted ‘offers’ for Sesko, as a report reveals when the striker will ‘decide’ his future with a third option an ‘unlikely’ possibility.",
      "Man Utd’s ‘next three signings’ have been ‘revealed’ as Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive” the remaining four members of the bomb squad.",
      "Man Utd have begun ‘formal talks’ to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig after sending ‘a secret delegation to Germany’, according to reports."

      "“Whoever comes in next, they have to hit the ground running. Emi is an interesting character, and you’d need to be that to take on a challenge like United right now.",
      "“He’s probably the closest goalkeeper in attitude to Fabien Barthez, and you need that. It’s a huge club, absolutely massive. He’s won the World Cup, he’s played with Lionel Messi, so he’s well suited as far as we can tell.",
      "“We won’t know for sure until and unless he moves, because we’ve seen goalkeepers crumble in minutes, like Massimo Taibi, with the pressure of United. They make a few mistakes and then you never see them again.",
      "“The only reason that’s not happened to Onana yet is because their other keepers are no better than him. If you can’t look to your number two at all to take the pressure off, then there’s a huge issue there.”",

      "Thursday 31 July 2025 15:41, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United \"look like a different team\" after they earned their second victory in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United followed up their 2-1 win over West Ham by beating Bournemouth 4-1 on Thursday morning, even without new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "There are indications that the same players who struggled last season in the Premier League are now more comfortable in Amorim's shape.",
      "\"It was a good game. We played with intensity. We were aggressive and that is something that we need to improve from last season,\" said Amorim. \"We had better possession compared to the last game, so they are listening.",
      "\"Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.",
      "\"It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.",
      "\"It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Amorim said: \"More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.",
      "\"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" said Amorim. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.",
      "\"We are very far right now from United,\" he said. \"They are a hell of a team. They have signed very well and today they showed they are above us in this moment.\"",
      "Amorim had insisted all along that perhaps the changes that he wanted to make at Old Trafford would be easier to implement during a summer and there were encouraging signs in Chicago that the worst of his time at United could now be behind him.",
      "There were plenty of positives in this performance against Bournemouth that went deeper than the result. In difficult conditions, United moved the ball impressively and played with real intensity and no little cohesion. In other words, it was different.",
      "There were interchanges between Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount, the latter adding weight to the theory that Amorim's system will suit him in the long term. Patrick Dorgu, having shown himself to be a useful outlet last season, suggested he can build on that promise.",
      "This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.",

      "Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has emerged as a top target for Manchester United in this window if they sign a striker.",
      "Exploratory talks have also been held with Sesko's representatives and it is understood that while Manchester United are keen to sign him, it will not be a simple deal to do financially.",
      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",

      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",

      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "Like Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Sesko could help add counter-attacking threat to a Manchester United side that only scored four fast-break goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness might be part of his appeal to Manchester United.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "It is likely another part of his appeal to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to Old Trafford would bring considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United."

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.",
      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",
      "Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of change to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.",
      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are focusing on sales, but work continues behind the scenes around the potential recruitment of a striker.",
      "United have been in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future amid interest in him from Italy.",
      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "Gary Neville has backed Ruben Amorim's overhaul of the Man Utd squad, including the summer signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and moving them out. That's a positive,\" Neville told Sky News.",
      "\"The second thing is I do like are the signing of [Mathues] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got Premier League experience.",
      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",
      "\"The two signings are good signings yet there's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to sign a forward.",
      "\"They have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse really.\"",

      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
