      "Real Betis star Antony had pain written across his face after Chelsea beat the Spanish side to win the Conference League. The Manchester United flop has thrived during his loan spell in Seville, but couldn't cap the season with a trophy.",
      "Chelsea did things the hard way in the final in Wroclaw. Ez Abde gave Betis a half-time advantage, only for Cole Palmer to lead the comeback with a pair of assists after the hour mark.",
      "Palmer set up Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson to turn the game on its head. There was time for more, though, with Jadon Sancho combining with fellow substitute Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for a third and Moises Caicedo adding some stoppage-time gloss to the scoreline,",
      "After the final whistle, Antony could be seen hunched over, appearing to be gathering his thoughts. In one photo, Chelsea stars Levi Colwill and Romeo Lavia can be seen looking towards the Brazilian, who was seen in tears after Betis' defeat.",
      "It was a better story for his fellow United outcast Sancho, though. The former Borussia Dortmund star joined Chelsea on loan from United at the end of the summer window, and ends the campaign with a European trophy while his parent club miss out after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Antony might have struggled at Old Trafford, but he rediscovered his form with Betis. He has nine goals and five assists across 26 games for the club - having only managed 12 goals and five assists in his 96 United outings.",
      "Both Antony and Sancho now face uncertain futures. Chelsea and United included an obligation to buy in their loan - though the Blues can still get out of it - while Antony's future may depend on whether Betis or any other club can meet the Red Devils' asking price.",
      "\"Watching from the bench you can see where the spaces are and how you can help the team. When I came on for Benny [Badiashile] I could see he was working so hard and then the gaps were open. He did that for me, laid the foundations for me.\"",

      "Manchester United's miserable May continued in Malaysia on Thursday and head coach Ruben Amorim was under no illusions about his team's struggles. The beaten Europa League finalists suffered another 1-0 reverse, this time against ASEAN All Stars in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Maung Maung Lwin, a Burmese international who plays his club football in Thailand, scored the only goal of the game. Amorim put his full squad to use, making multiple substitutions and blooding youngsters during the friendly, but was in no mood to make excuses.",
      "“No injuries and a tough pitch,\" Amorim told reporters after the game, but he was clearly unhappy. \"We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what. We need to bring that inside of us in every game.",
      "“The important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better. I liked the young kids, they try. That’s enough for me in the moment. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody to play. They did well.”",
      "United have one more friendly to come during the money-spinning tour, against the Hong Kong national team on Friday. After that, attention will turn towards strengthening a squad which only managed a 15th place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim was able to welcome two new faces in the winter window, with Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven joining from Lecce and Arsenal respectively. Matheus Cunha is set to become the first summer arrival, with United meeting the Brazil forward's £62.5million release clause.",
      "That deal isn't quite done yet, though. “You have to wait for that,\" Amorim saidr. \"I won’t confirm anything. I have no news. We will see. There will be some changes”",
      "United rounded off their league season with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on Sunday, but were unable to avoid their worst ever Premier League finish. After ending up 15th with just 42 points, their head coach apologised to the fans.",
      "\"First of all, I want to apologise for this season. I know you are really disappointed with me and the team,\" he said. \"Secondly, I want to say thank you. We are very grateful for your support this season and I know it was really hard to support us in many games.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim kept his cards close to his chest when asked about the club's pursuit of Matheus Cunha. Wolves striker Cunha is set for a medical ahead of a £62.5million Old Trafford switch, but some formalities still need to be ironed out.",
      "Cunha has made clear he is a fan of Amorim, who won titles with Sporting CP before moving to the Premier League. In a recent interview with Brazilian media, he all but confirmed his move when speaking about the United boss.",
      "\"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best,\" Cunha told CNN Brasil (via the Daily Mail). \"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal,\"",
      "When asked about linking up with the Portuguese, he added: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help,\" though Amorim is in nio mood to jump the gun.",
      "“You have to wait for that,\" Amorim told reporters during United's post-season tour. \"I won’t confirm anything. I have no news. We will see. There will be some changes”",
      "United fans were given a reminder of why their pursuit of a goalscorer like Cunha has accelerated. Amorim's side began their tour of Malaysia with a friendly against ASEAN All Stars, but fell to a 1-0 defeat in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund and Chido Obi were given 45 minutes each in the game, with Joshua Zirkzee not involved after only recently returning from injury. Hojlund and Zirkzee scored just seven league goals between them, while teenager Obi only started his first Premier League match in May.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim also took some small positives - including predicting more minutes for young midfielder Sekou Kone. The 19-year-old, who joined from Malian side Guidars last summer, has made Premier League matchday squads on several occasions without making a senior competitive appearance.",
      "\"The important thing is no injuries, with this weather and everything that we did to arrive here in this day,\" Amorim said. \"But, again, it's not an excuse. We should perform better.",
      "\"We have to control the minutes of everybody. He [Kone] will play more in the next game on Friday. He did quite well but all the young kids tried, that is the most important thing. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody, so everybody can play. They did well.\"",

      "Kirsten Heukels, the body language consultant hired by Manchester United on a £175,000-per-year salary, has defended her role at the club amid criticism from part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Heukels joined the club during Erik ten Hag's time as manager, but was pointed to by Ratcliffe in a discussion of how the club was haemhorraging money when he arrived.",
      "One of Heukels' roles was to help United's players with penalty shoot-outs. Her background was outside football, but during her time the club secured vital shoot-out victories over Brighton and Coventry in successive FA Cup campaigns.",
      "She spoke with United's keepers during her time at Old Trafford, and also met outfield players. However, speaking to The Athletic, she claims there was no direct contact with anyone at owners INEOS.",
      "“I don’t look at life this way,” Heukels said when asked about Ratcliffe's comments. “I believe it was a courageous thing that the team did back then. And I’m proud of what we achieved.",
      "\"The achievements are in the data, so they are proven. I don’t need to explain that to anybody,\" she continued. \"I don’t know enough about him or United today because I’m not involved, but it’s always dangerous to talk about your predecessors this way.”",
      "It was back in March that Ratcliffe referenced Heukels' role and salary - albeit not her name - in an interview with The Times. In the same piece, the billionaire opened up on the financial situation affecting the club since his arrival.",
      "“If you think of it in really simple terms, you’ve got the operating costs, which are all the staff and the fixed costs of running the business,\" he said. \"And then you’ve got all the squad costs, player salaries and player purchases.",
      "“In super simple terms, the club has been spending more money than it’s been earning now for the last seven years, and it ends in a very difficult place. And for Manchester United, that place ended at the end of this year, the end of 2025, with the club running out of cash. I think it’s the first time we’ve probably said that in public, but that’s the fact of the matter.”",
      "Heukels, who also credits former United coach Steve McClaren among others for helping her during her time at Old Trafford, predominantly scouted opposition penalty takers. The 2023 Brighton shoot-out win was described as a breakthrough, while she was also in her role when David de Gea made his first Old Trafford penalty save in nine years during a match against Fulham shortly after.",
      "“I look at how they are walking up to the spot,” Heukels explains. “How their face is holding itself, because you can think you’re looking cool but your face will tell me more and you will leak it all. I will look at body language and their interaction with the goalkeeper — whether they are looking at him or not.”",

Wednesday's fixture was the first of two friendlies on United's schedule as part of a post-season tour which is set to earn the club £8million.",
      "That's big money to United these days, having missed out on European football altogether next season after finishing 15th in the Premier League this term. But fans weren't thinking about budgets as they watched two strong line-ups - one for each half - lose to a team made up of players from the likes of Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and more.",

The Brazilian international is on the verge of joining Manchester United from Wolverhampton Wanderers in a £62.5million deal after a career-best season at Molineux.",
      "Cunha ended the campaign with 15 league goals - the joint-most for a Brazilian in the Premier League, matching totals posted by Roberto Firmino and Gabriel Martinelli. He also signed a contract extension with Wolves midway through the campaign, allowing them to recoup a significant fee.",
      "This was enough to convince United to match his release clause, and there is optimism the deal can be wrapped up before Cunha links up with the Brazil squad. The forward is part of Carlo Ancelotti's first squad since taking over as head coach, with matched against Ecuador and Paraguay on the horizon in early June.",
      "There was a moment when Liverpool looked as though they might rival United for Cunha's signature. However, according to The Mail, their plans changed before the most recent offer from their fellow Premier League side.",
      "The former Atletico Madrid star is understood to have fans at Anfield, but the Reds' depth in attacking areas remained a factor. It has been claimed they weren't fully convinced when it came to how Cunha might fit into the current system, and instead have prioritised other targets.",
      "Top of that list of targets is Florian Wirtz. The Bayer Leverkusen star is being eyed up in a move which would see Liverpool pay a club record sum of £85m or more.",

Manchester City and Real Madrid were also mentioned in connection with the 21-year-old, but Liverpool are now leading the race - much to the frustration of Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen.",
      "\"Much more has been written than spoken,\" Dreesen told TZ (via the ECHO) before attempting what some have read as a dig at Liverpool over their failure to qualify for the upcoming Club World Cup. \"FC Bayern is one of the absolute top clubs in Europe and the world. Our appeal among fans, but also among players, is enormous.",
      "\"The fact that not every player will end up with us is simply part of the package; it's the same for other top clubs. But everyone knows: with FC Bayern, you can win everything every year, you're involved in every competition – the upcoming Club World Cup is a good example of that.",

      "Ferdinand was clear that he will now use his time to focus on other avenues, however, including his management firm 'New Era' and his blossoming production company which produces podcasts and interviews.",
      "The Mail also reported that Ferdinand could now look to move into US football (soccer) coverage with his management company recently signing an agreement with William Morris Endeavor (WME), who represent a number of American celebrities such as Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds from their base in Beverly Hills.",
      "There is certainly a growing demand for Premier League greats offering their insights in the US. The likes of Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Micah Richards have been highly successful on their CBS show, while NBC Sports have brought in Gary Neville this season.",
      "Ferdinand could be looking to follow suit, especially with the 2026 World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico right on the horizon, which is set to bring a fresh audience to the sport in North America.",
      "Ferdinand’s social media statement also indicated that his decision partly stemmed from wanting to spend more time with his family, having said: “I’m excited about what the future holds, spending more time with my family focusing on Rio Ferdinand Presents and my other business interests.”",
      "It follows a report from The Sun last month which suggested Ferdinand and his wife, Kate, are looking to move to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. It was claimed that the couple have already started looking at properties and schools in Dubai, having reportedly decided that now is the right time for them and their family to relocate.",
      "They share two children together, while Kate is also a stepmother to the footballer's three children from his previous marriage to late wife Rebecca Ellison, who died from cancer in 2015. It was also claimed that they will travel back and forth to the UK to fulfil their work commitments, with Kate being the founder of podcast and online platform ‘blended’. However, those reported plans to quit the UK altogether have not been publicly confirmed by Ferdinand.",
      "In a video posted on X, a Liverpool fan account posted a video in which he said: \"Look, football fans have had enough of the likes of Ferdinand and others. They've had enough of bitter commentators not having any neutrality in the job that they're doing.",
      "\"You don't need people like Rio Ferdinand there commentating on a Liverpool game knowing that he doesn't want to see you do anything or win anything. He should be behind the English club. But as is always the case with these commentators, their previous bias creeps in. Let me just say this wholeheartedly, f*** you Rio.\"",
      "Ferdinand wasted no time in responding to the foul-mouthed critique, writing: \"I wasn’t on the gantry when Liverpool scored. Like in the 1st half where I left the commentary position to go back down Pitchside after 36 minutes. I was asked to do the same in the 2nd half prior to the goal. Thanks.\"",
      "Savage defended Ferdinand by saying: “Some of the comments questioned whether Rio’s contribution was impartial given his 455 appearances and 10 major trophies, including six titles, as a United player. But I defy anyone – whether you played the game for United or another club - not to be excited by such an extraordinary finish.",
      "\"Football is an emotional game, and if co-commentators convey their passion when they are watching something sensational, they are only reflecting what viewers are feeling in their armchairs at home. Whether or not you approved of our antics caught on the TNT ‘comms cam’, surely you can’t look at something so incredible and remain indifferent.",
      "\"Rio is a United legend who knows the club, how it works and who calls the shots. He is not going to sit on his hands and sound like he’s reading the shipping forecast when his old team goes from 4-2 down with six minutes left to a 5-4 win. It’s not bias, it’s human emotion.\"",
      "Ferdinand and other pundits also came under fire for their strong criticism of the England men's national team’s performances at Euro 2024, where the Three Lions were lacklustre for much of the tournament despite reaching the final.",
      "He said on an episode of Rio Ferdinand Presents: “If there’s been below par performances, there’s no way that you can expect anyone, us as pundits or fans, to sit there and go, ‘Well done guys – pat on the back.' I played in tournaments where we didn’t do well. I never expected anybody to then come out with positive comments. I don’t think in any industry you work in, if you don’t perform, that you’d expect anything other than criticism.\"",
      "Ferdinand was unfortunately unable to cover Arsenal’s Champions League visit to Paris Saint-Germain last month after being rushed to hospital. The Red Devils icon posted a selfie from a hospital bed on social media with the caption: “Gutted to be missing the Semi-Finals this week on @tntsportsfootball! Wishing the team all the best — I’ll be watching every minute from the iPad!\"",
      "Having received plenty of well-wishes from fans, the former centre-back later revealed he had suffered from a nasty virus, which made him think he was even going to die. Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: \"I had a mad virus. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously.",
      "“I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn't even open my eyes. Then, the headache I had… I don't get migraines or nothing else so I don't know what they're like. I thought my head was in a vice and my eyes were going to pop out. Then, I was being sick, projectile vomiting in the toilet, I got back to bed and I was having vertigo. I was holding onto the sheets, I didn't know where I was. It was crazy.\"",
      "He added: \"I had to go to hospital and the doctor even said to me, 'Do you want an ambulance?' So that's when I knew. He went, 'We're going to get your brain scanned.' I thought it was a virus or a flu or something so when he mentioned brain scan and the ambulance, the panic was nuts. I went to hospital and I was in there for a few days. I couldn't even enjoy the hospital food. The soup and the ice cream normally does wonders.\"",
      "That will be alongside its other offerings, which includes the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Women’s Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League and National League, domestic and European club rugby, MotoGP, NBA, UFC and boxing. BT Sport, as it was previously called, won exclusive rights to all live Champions League fixtures and highlights back in 2018.",

      "Manchester United have been told to abandon their pursuit of Liam Delap and target Victor Osimhen instead. Delap, 22, has emerged as United's No.1 priority in their search to sign a striker this summer.",
      "The England youth international has a £30million release clause in his contract with Ipswich Town, who were relegated from the Premier League this season. Delap still managed to score 12 goals for the Tractor Boys, boosting his stock after three promising spells in the Championship on loan from Manchester City.",
      "But there are doubts for Delap's suitability for United. Boss Ruben Amorim already has two young strikers in his squad - Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund - neither of whom have been prolific since joining the Red Devils one and two years ago respectively. It's feared that adding another relatively inexperienced striker could exacerbate the problems which Amorim is already facing.",
      "That's why former United midfielder Darren Gibson believes that 'established striker' Osimhen would be a better option. \"Honestly? I don't think Liam Delap is an upgrade on Zirkzee or Hojlund,\" Gibson told AceOdds.com. \"They're both so young and they've come in at a difficult time.",
      "\"Normally young strikers would have a more experienced striker to learn from and bounce off them. If United had bought Harry Kane two summers ago I think Hojlund or Zirkzee would be different players learning from him.",
      "\"I don't mean to take anything away from Delap but I don't think he's an upgrade. Rio [Ferdinand] spoke about the pressure at United recently and how players don't realise how difficult it is.",
      "\"Right now Delap is at Ipswich and there's not much pressure on him. He's playing with freedom but it's different at United. They need an established striker.",
      "\"Victor Osimhen would be my top target. He scores goals and he's more experienced. He can teach the younger lads.\"",
      "Should Manchester United sign Liam Delap or Victor Osimhen? Give us your pick in the comments section.",

      "In Turkey, Osimhen has scored 36 goals in 40 games so far. Gala have already won a league and cup double this term, and they'll face Istanbul Basaksehir on Friday looking to extend their 11-point gap to second-place Fenerbahce.",
      "Osimhen's future is a major talking point in Istanbul, with Premier League rivals Chelsea, Saudi Arabian champions Al-Hilal and Italian giants Juventus linked alongside United. The Napoli star has remained tight-lipped on his future, last addressing the topic in February.",

      "\"I live for the moment. [As] for what's going to happen in the summer, I don't know, but I want everyone to understand something: I really love this club so much. I love the fans, I love everyone associated with this club, from the president down to the coaching staff.\""

      "Manchester United have sunk to a new low with Maung Maung Lwin earning the ASEAN All Stars a post-season friendly win in sweaty Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Ruben Amorim made 16 substitutions during a low-intensity run out at the national stadium in front of an excitable crowd. That included most of his big names, with Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes being introduced at the break, but none of them could create much as they lost again.",
      "And third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton had to pick the ball out of his net midway through the second period when Burmese winger Lwin - who has two goals in 20 games in the Thai league - got on the end of Adrian Segecic's defence-splitting pass to score the only goal. United next face a Hong Kong selection on Friday afternoon in similarly difficult conditions.",
      "Here are the talking points from another strange and dispiriting day for Amorim and his team.",
      "The most popular man in Kuala Lumpur - based on the loud cheers every time he received possession - was Harry Maguire. Every time the England defender received and completed a basic pass the volume went up.",
      "And when he got on the end of a deep corner there was a big roar despite no real danger being created.",
      "The sight of Maguire being substituted in a quadruple change after half an hour was a major disappointment, then. Though at least for his sake he was not around when United went behind.",
      "That change also coincided with United beginning to (briefly) play some cohesive football. They were second best for the opening 30 minutes with Ayden Heaven particularly given the runaround by Hai Long Nguyen.",
      "Yet the introduction of several young players brought more life from the exalted visitors. Jaydan Kamason and Shea Lacey were both proactive and Kobbie Mainoo, given the armband by Maguire, stood out in midfield before he was replaced.",
      "The introduction of Fernandes and Garnacho at the break should have seen United step it up but they continued to struggle.",
      "It is hard to be anything nearing positive about Rasmus Hojlund, whose first touch and control was all over the place in another grim struggle for the centre-forward.",
      "He is sapped of confidence and needs a big reset. But whether that is possible in the off-season remains to be seen.",
      "There is a player in there somewhere but so much has happened in the past two seasons that Old Trafford increasingly looks like the place where it cannot be unlocked.",
      "He may have reportedly been told to find a new club after being left on the bench until late against Tottenham last week but he came on here and did actually put some work in down the left flank when many of those around him barely made an impact.",
      "What happens to Garnacho remains to be seen but it does seem odd that United would let one of their few long-term bright prospects depart - no matter the potential for disputes.",
      "Before the game more than a dozen dignitaries were on the pitch for the ceremonial handshakes and the presence of a jumbo cardboard cheque worth a million in the local currency – or roughly £175,000.",
      "And among the United contingent was Omar Berrada, the chief executive, who also admitted the club’s approach in this summer’s transfer window must be “prudent” after a “difficult season” in which they made a series of “tough decisions.”",

If they don't get off to a good start [next season], which I don't see how they can, I think he's gone after a dozen games.\"",
      "Amorim expressed his regret at how United's season turned out after their final game against Aston Villa. Addressing fans at Old Trafford from the pitch, he said: \"First of all, I want to apologise. It was really disappointing with the team. Secondly, I want to say thank you.",
      "\"We are very grateful for your support during the season. I know it was really hard to support us in many games. But now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past. Because this season is in the past, it's over.",

      "United have already started preparing for a busy summer as Amorim looks to revamp his squad. Matheus Cunha is on the cusp of joining the club in a £62.5million move from Wolves, while Ipswich Town forward Liam Delap has also been identified as a key target.",
      "The release clauses of Cunha and Delap combined amount to £92.5m, which have influenced United's swift decision-making. However, the club will also need to move players on to raise funds if more new signings are to be realised.",

      "Arsenal and Manchester United fans are buzzing at the prospect of Viktor Gyokeres joining their ranks this summer. And certain members of his inner circle have already given some considerable clues concerning his transfer fate.",
      "The ex-Coventry star has thrived since joining Sporting Lisbon almost two years ago, having signed for the club under current United boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres has propelled the Lions to back-to-back Primeira Liga triumphs and topped the scoring charts in both campaigns, bagging an impressive 54 goals in all competitions this term.",
      "Sporting's dramatic comeback to secure a 3-1 victory over Benfica and lift the Taca de Portugal saw the Swede bag a pivotal 101st-minute penalty that forced extra time. Partner Ines Aguiar was at the game and found herself swamped by eager fans, all desperate for a scoop on her beau's future.",
      "Amid the frenzy, Lisbon-born actress Aguiar reportedly assured the clamouring crowd and media that he would be staying put, according to A Bola, as she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to commit to a third season with Sporting.",
      "The sway of a significant other can't be underestimated when it comes to transfers, but the Emirates has some significant edge over Old Trafford in terms of its current allure. Arsenal will return to Champions League contention next term, while United's fall to Tottenham in the Europa League final means they won't play European football of any kind.",
      "The Gunners reportedly entered discussions with Gyokeres' agent this week after Correio da Manha said representatives had jetted to Lisbon. Mikel Arteta caught criticism for failing to add another forward to his ranks last summer, but appears to be on the front foot in correcting that error this time around.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres' uncle, Chris, dished the details on his nephew's future during a chat with the media ahead of the Taca de Portugal final. He divulged the Gyokeres family met up for dinner the night before, where the star's transfer future was a hot topic.",
      "And Uncle Chris wasn't shy about sharing his views from that discussion, albeit perhaps with a pinch of personal bias. Since Gyokeres settled into life at Estadio Jose Alvalade in 2023, his relatives have come to love Lisbon, and Chris went so far as to say the family agreed their golden child should continue calling the city his home.",
      "\"Yes, very much,\" he told Sport.TV, when asked if he and the family felt a connection to Lisbon. \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "The desires of Gyokeres' family won't concern Arsenal or United as much as the player's intentions, given that he will make the final decision. The Red Devils have at least one edge, given Amorim's shared history with the player, but United are no longer the same attraction they once were.",
      "And in fact the team may have already accepted defeat in the race amid word United seem close to bagging Wolves forward Matheus Cunha for £62.5million. Premier League rivals Chelsea are also understood to be eyeing a move for Gyokeres and can offer the Champions League football he'd desire.",
      "Sporting don't appear to be in a rush to sell their prized asset, believed to be on the market for £60m. At a recent press event set up by Radio Renascenca's Bola Branca, vice-president Francisco Salgado Zenha provided some clarity on the matter.",
      "\"Gyokeres? He has three more years on his contract,\" he said. \"At the moment, there are no offers. He has three more years on his contract. I think the answer has been given.\""

The Red Devils are at the beginning of a major squad turnover this summer, with current manager Ruben Amorim planning to \"improve the team we have\" from the starting eleven all the way through to the academy.",
      "One star that Amorim is reportedly keen to bring in is Ipswich Town striker Delap. He is likely to appear in the transfer market this summer following the club's relegation at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 12 goals and assisted twice in his most recent campaign and is available for £30million due to a relegation clause written into Delap's contract with Ipswich.",
      "Delap has reportedly been in contact with several clubs, including Chelsea, Everton, Newcastle and United, ahead of the transfer window opening.",
      "The Red Devils are said to have agreed to the framework of a deal for the young attacker, including an outline of personal terms with Delap's agents. While other Premier League sides are interested in his services, United could sway Delap towards Old Trafford by offering him a sweetener in the form of his chosen shirt number.",
      "Across his professional career, Delap has opted for the number 19 while representing Ipswich in the Premier League and also during his international career with England's youth squads. Other digits used include 20 with Hull City and seven with Preston North End, but he has seemingly settled on 19 as his preferred squad number for the future.",
      "And United are in luck, as this shirt is currently available on the list of vacancies in their squad. The number 19 was most recently used by high-profile signing Varane, who exited the squad for Como in last year's summer transfer window before retiring just weeks later in September 2024.",
      "Before his exit last summer, Varane was one of the highest earners in United's team, with the Mail reporting that the Frenchman was earning up to £350,000-a-week since signing a contract in 2021.",
      "Other players who utilised the same number as Varane in the past include current United star Amad Diallo and out-of-favour forward Marcus Rashford.",
      "However, it seems like Amorim is going for a more modest squad ahead of the 2025/26 season after their humiliating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Speaking ahead of United's preseason tour through Malaysia and Hong Kong, the Red Devils boss has admitted that the club had two plans based on what went down in Bilbao earlier in May. He said: \"We always prepare two plans.",
      "\"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad. We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Following the 1-0 loss to Spurs that cemented trophyless United's exit from European football for the upcoming campaign, Amorim insists that his team will take their lessons from previous games and look to move forward as soon as possible.",
      "He added: \"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter. It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",

      "New data compiled by environmental campaigners Carbon Boot shows that Newcastle have racked up by far the most air miles of any Premier League side across the 2024/25 season.",
      "The Magpies flew an estimated 8,031 miles during their domestic campaign, significantly more than the next worst culprits, Liverpool (3,268 miles) and Manchester City (3,060 miles). Other more remote clubs, like Bournemouth (2,420 miles), Southampton (1,938 miles) and Ipswich (1,931 miles) were also among the biggest fliers.",
      "Using publicly available flight data, researchers were able to find evidence that Newcastle flew at least one leg of all their 19 away matches over the Premier League season, with the vast majority of journeys made by air in both directions. By comparing flight times with available trains, they were able to show when such flights – which are seven times more polluting than trains – were unnecessary.",
      "They were far from the only culpable team, with over 40,000 air miles flown in total. Shockingly, the data showed that there were 116 domestic flights altogether, 65 of which were under 35 minutes long in duration.",
      "Among those guilty of unnecessary flights were Aston Villa, who flew 27 minutes from Birmingham Airport to London Biggin Hill Airport to play Crystal Palace on February 25, despite there being regular and fast rail connections between the two cities.",
      "Meanwhile, Man City flew to and from Newcastle on September 28, for 31 minutes and 27 minutes respectively, instead of taking the train which is only two hours and 20 minutes each way. One of the shortest flights saw Wolves take a 26-minute flight from Southampton to Birmingham Airport after playing Saints on March 15 to avoid a coach journey of three hours and 15 minutes.",
      "\"It's disappointing to see so many Premier League clubs flying to matches when they don't need to,” said Michael Solomon Williams from the Campaign for Better Transport, one of the groups behind the research.",
      "“Clubs need to be setting a better example when it comes to reducing their negative impact on the planet by swapping climate-busting flights for more sustainable train or coach travel.”",
      "The Premier League committed to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework in November 2021, meaning it aims to cut its emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. And there were some examples of teams taking their environmental commitments seriously.",
      "Carbon Boot estimates that Crystal Palace only flew 179 miles all season, while Brentford were the second greenest club on 550 miles. London clubs undoubtedly have an advantage, given there were seven teams based in the capital this season, and the city is better connected than most others.",
      "Peter Crisp from Fossil Free Football said: “Fans know that a world with much more flooding and extreme heat is terrible for all levels of our game. It’s time for clubs to end the flying, cut out avoidable pollution and show the real climate leadership needed to protect football’s future. If fans can get up and down the country by road and rail, then so can the players.”",

      "Matheus Cunha will undergo a Manchester United medical and, all being well, put pen to paper on his move to Old Trafford this week before flying off on international duty. United have agreed a £62.5million deal with Wolves to sign the Brazil international.",
      "Despite their difficult and disappointing Premier League campaign, United have been in pole position to land the ex-Atletico Madrid and RB Leipzig forward since the close of the January transfer window. Then, Cunha's representatives pushed to engineer a move to Arsenal - given their needs for a forward and with their main targets unavailable during that window - but only Nottingham Forest firmed up their interest and he instead signed a new contract at Molineux.",
      "That deal included a £62.5m release clause, which Wolves felt was fair value for a player who scored 15 goals and registered six assists in the Premier League this season, and which importantly laid out exactly how Wanderers would be paid.",
      "Initially, United - who have made Cunha their No.1 target this summer at the behest of head coach Ruben Amorim - made an offer to pay his fee in five instalments over the course of five years. That was swiftly rejected by the Black Country club who insisted they would only accept the deal stated in his contract.",
      "United quickly agreed to accept those terms, which sees £20.8m paid up front, then the same figure at the end of the 2025-26 campaign and again in the summer of 2027.",
      "Cunha, who has spoken about wanting to take the next step in his career has already agreed terms on a £200k-a-week contract until 2030, with the option for an extra year. He is eager to take on the challenge of playing for United, despite their miserable 2024-25 campaign.",
      "The confident 26-year-old - who celebrated his birthday this week - believes he can lead the Europa League final into a new era, and that he has the personality and quality to have a transformative effect on the side. That belief extends to Cunha asking for the club's No.10 shirt during contract negotiations, which currently belongs to Marcus Rashford who is expected to depart this summer.",
      "He is also looking forwards to working with Ruben Amorim and was impressed after talks with the United boss on how he sees Cunha fitting into his much-talked about 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Speaking to CNN Brazil after Wolves' 1-1 draw with Brentford on Sunday, he was asked about Amorim and said: \"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach. I wish him nothing but the best. I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal.\"",
      "Asked if they could do that together, he said: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help.\"",
      "Cunha, who purchased new Rolex watches as farewell gifts for Wolves' Brazilian midfield pair Joao Gomes and Andre, also sent a message to supporters on social media after waving goodbye to Molineux on Sunday.",
      "\"Wolves, what can I say to you?\" he remarked. \"What an incredible season. We didn't get to where you deserve to be, but we did everything we could to make you proud. I love these guys.",
      "\"Individually, it was the best season of my life. All of this was only possible because of all the dedication and love I have for this club. \"I became the Brazilian with the most goals in a Premier League season, along with Roberto Firmino and Gabriel Martinelli.",
      "\"I made mistakes and got things right, but always because I lived this club so much. All I ever wanted was to do the impossible for Wolves. Another one is over. And thank you all for all the affection.\"",

      "Those two contests stand to earn the club £8million in revenue, but their trip hasn't resulted in the same excitement levels as before. Once upon a time the Manchester outfit could lay claim to being the biggest in the world and they enjoyed mega popularity in Asia.",
      "The last time the club won the Premier League trophy was in 2013. A year before that the club ran a report which claimed they had 659m followers worldwide - and half of those were from the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "United will make use of 84,000 capacity Bukit Jalil Stadium, which is one of Asia's biggest, and whilst more than 40,000 tickets were snapped up within hours of going on sale - a number of seats are still available in most price categories. Those with local knowledge admitted the interest levels have declined.",
      "Haresh Deol, founder of Malaysian news organisation TwentyTwo13, told the BBC: \"There is chatter among fans [about the game], some form of excitement, but it isn't as intense as the club's prior visits to the region, when it was performing well in the Premier League.\"",
      "There are also reports in China that Friday's game in the 40,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium against a Hong Kong XI may not sell out. Again, it shows how the United popularity has fallen give that on their last visit in 2009 games were absolute sellouts with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen in action.",
      "Arch rivals Liverpool have always enjoyed support in the traditional South-East Asian nations like Malaysia and Singapore, but their recent success has seen them excel in markets such as India, China and Japan. Their interest and viewership of the Premier League is more recent and United cannot rely on their historic success.",
      "Mumbai-based United fan Rahul Singh said: \"Under Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool were not just successful again but seemed more cool with the way they played, their stars as well as Anfield. City have just been so successful with Pep and Erling Haaland is very famous. United are not only not winning trophies but they are not exciting to watch.\"",
      "Fans in Malaysia have grown tired with watching United lose, which they did more often than not this season. Deol admitted that \"the younger generation want to associate themselves with teams that are actually consistently at the top.\"",

      "Antony suggested that it would affect his game and slow down his speed, power and quality on the ball, according to a report in Spain.",
      "Workers at the stadium immediately looked at the pitch and began working on it after Real Betis’ open training session to suggest there is a problem.",
      "And it could be made worse by the fact that rain is forecast in Wroclaw ahead of the final which kicks off at 9pm local time (8pm in UK).",
      "Chelsea trained later at the stadium but they did a much lighter session, having already gone through their paces back in England at their training ground at Cobham, Surrey before flying to Poland.",

      "The stadium - which has a capacity of 45,000 - was built ahead of the Euros in 2012. England played most recently there when they faced Ukraine two years ago in the summer of 2023 in a Euros qualifier, the game ending in a 1-1 draw.",

      "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has revealed any decision over the future of Jadon Sancho will only come after the UEFA Conference League final. The Blues coach was steadfast in his belief that the club's focus should remain on finding success against Real Betis.",
      "Maresca has included Sancho in his squad to take on the Spanish side in Wroclaw, as he bids to earn the club's first trophy since the Club World Cup title in 2022. The winger has scored one goal and produced five assists in the competition en route to the final.",
      "Sancho joined Chelsea on loan at the start of the season from Manchester United. The deal included the condition that the club would be obligated to make the deal permanent for £25million should they finish higher than 14th in the division.",

      "\"I don't know,\" Maresca said. \"I said that when in the last weeks you asked me about different players, I always said the same. And the reason why is because it's the truth.",
      "\"It's not the moment, we have tomorrow the final. Then in 24 hours, 48 hours, we're going to start to talk about the future. But at this moment, there is not any thought or any decision made on Jadon or any different players.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes had the perfect response to transfer interest during his time at Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese midfielder has been United's talisman since arriving at Old Trafford in January 2020 and was heavily relied upon again during another difficult campaign.",
      "Fernandes, 30, was often among the few bright sparks in a United team that finished 15th in the Premier League and lost out to Tottenham in a dour Europa League final. In the aftermath of the team's defeat in Bilbao, Fernandes admitted that he would reluctantly leave if the Red Devils accepted a move, and the Daily Mail has reported that Al-Hilal are one of the first clubs to test their resolve by setting a strict deadline for a transfer.",
      "The Saudi Pro League side are claimed to have given Fernandes until Thursday to decide on a move worth around £100million, which would see the United skipper earn around £200m in wages over the course of three years. However, Fernandes is accustomed to interest from other clubs and impressed the Sporting hierarchy when a high-profile deal was rejected, just months before he signed for United.",
      "Fernandes was the subject of a £58m (€65m) offer from Spurs in 2019. Fresh from reaching the Champions League final, Mauricio Pochettino's side had identified him as the next key part of the puzzle. However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas explained that the bid was rejected due to the structure of the deal.",
      "Spurs tabled an initial £40m (€45m) with another £18m (€20m) in bonuses, including winning the Premier League and Champions League. At the end of the summer transfer window, Varandas celebrated the club keeping hold of who he described as the \"best midfielder in Europe\", and shed light on Fernandes' reaction.",
      "\"It was 'impossible' to retain Bruno Fernandes, but we did it,\" Varandas said in a club statement in September 2021. \"We prepared for his sale by putting a fair price on him, and we had bids, but the only serious offer was from Tottenham, and that was €45 million plus another €20m in bonuses for winning the Premier League and the Champions League. Those are difficult objectives, so we chose not to accept.\"",
      "On the midfielder's reaction, Varandas added: \"Bruno Fernandes proved to be not only a great player but a great professional and captain. The dignity and responsibility that he has always shown is exemplary.",
      "\"The day I turned down Tottenham's proposal, I came to the training ground and spoke to him. I told him why I declined the offer and why he would stay here beyond the end of the market and he understood perfectly.",
      "\"In addition, he also understood that the bid they offered us was not fair. He's not leaving, he's a Sporting player. Many European clubs want him and we know this is something we will always have to deal with.\"",
      "Fernandes had also been linked with Real Madrid, Juventus and United that summer before the Red Devils snapped him up in the January window, joining in a deal worth £68m (€80m). The midfielder is currently leading the team on their post-season tour of Malaysia. However, he was honest about his future after losing to Spurs in the Europa League final, which cost United a place in the Champions League and could force the club to sell key players to fund new signings.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this,\" Fernandes said. \"I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days.",
      "\"In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.\"",
      "Fernandes could reportedly earn £700k-per-week tax-free, plus performance-related bonuses, if he were to join Al-Hilal, who are eager to add a star name before the Club World Cup in June. However, United boss Ruben Amorim wants Fernandes to remain at the club.",
      "\"He's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team,\" Amorim said. \"The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball, the team has different moments and in different moments Bruno [Fernandes] takes responsibility.\"",

      "Neither would ever be housed in the Old Trafford museum or featured as attractions for picture opportunities as part of the stadium tour. Ruben Amorim looked uncomfortable enough to be standing behind the Maybank Cup at Tuesday's pre-match press conference.",
      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",
      "There was a Sergio Aguero in the ASEAN All-Stars line-up, but it wasn’t that one. Instead, Maung Maung Lwin wrote his name into Malaysian football folklore as the matchwinner against United.",
      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",

      "United, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Everton have all held talks with Delap, who has a £30million release clause following Ipswich's relegation.",

      "Carsley has to whittle his training squad down to 23 players by June 6 but Delap seems a certainty to be included.",
      "Delap, 22, has been identified as one of United’s primary targets to sharpen an attack that ended the Premier League season with a derisory 44 goals and a -10 goal difference.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim again lamented the “lack of goals” in the squad during the club’s post-season tour in Kuala Lumpur.Manchester City academy graduate Delap scored 12 Premier League goals for Ipswich last season, having signed for the club last year. Delap came through at City when United technical director Jason Wilcox was the club's academy director.",

      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.\""

      "Neither would ever be housed in the Old Trafford museum or featured as attractions for picture opportunities as part of the stadium tour. Ruben Amorim looked uncomfortable enough to be standing behind the Maybank Cup at Tuesday's pre-match press conference.",
      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",

      "Bayindir is doing some stretches, so the fans have the good fortune of being able to watch him in the second half, it looks like.",
      "These games can be a good cure for insomnia but Hojlund still looks the same. Isolated, detached and sloppy on the ball. He must be itching to link up with the Denmark squad for their June matches as he needs a change of scenery away from the United set-up.",
      "Mainoo looked set to put United ahead a moment or so ago. A free-kick from the left was floated to the back post, nodded back across, Mainoo pulled the trigger and his shot was blocked by the defender on the line.",
      "Followers of the academy have been patiently waiting for Lacey to get a chance and he's just come onto the pitch, so let's see what he can do. Lacey has missed some time on the pitch this season, but he's supremely talented.",

      "Onana has a save to make, getting down sharply to turn away a low drive from the left corner of the penalty area. The ASEAN All-Stars have improved in the last ten minutes or so.",

      "Moorhouse has been bright so far. He is showing for the ball, dropping into pockets of space to try and be found. He has also attempted a couple of progressive carries to get United up the pitch.",
      "A brief spell of pressure from ASEAN All-Stars almost leads to the game's opening goal. The ball falls kindly for Aguero at the edge of the box, but his strike goes over the bar.",
      "United aren't wavering from competitive matchdays. Carlos Fernandes is still coming into the technical area to coordinate set pieces and Amorim is trying to inject some energy into the play.",
      "The crowd are unfailingly enthusiastic and wowed by the mere presence of United players young and old. The stadium has filled up a little more since kick-off and the lower blocks behind the goals are packed to the rafters.",
      "It's 31 degrees and the players' shirts are already sticking to their bodies. Considering the temperature, the pace and intensity of the game is decent, although the quality in the final third has lacked.",
      "United youngster Munro has just conceded a foul about 35 yards from goal for dragging Dukuly to the turf. He escaped a booking and the effort from Hai Long went miles over the bar.",
      "United have had almost all of the possession in the opening six minutes. They are regularly switching the play and attempt to move the ASEAN All-Stars players around.",
      "Diogo Dalot has been able to get forward from right wing-back a couple of times."

      "Jadon Sancho showed his true colours following Chelsea's 4-1 win over Real Betis in the UEFA Conference League final. The 25-year-old winger, who joined the Blues on loan from Manchester United last summer, played a crucial role in the victory at the Wrocław Stadium on Wednesday night.",
      "Abde Ezzalzouli fired Real Betis ahead inside the opening ten minutes, giving the Spanish outfit the lead at the break. Chelsea leapt out of the blocks in the second half, with Enzo Fernandez netting an equaliser on the hour mark.",
      "A few moments later, Nicolas Jackson found net, latching onto a delightful cross from Cole Palmer. Sancho doubled the west Londoners' lead with an excellent strike after cutting inside onto his right foot.",
      "Then, in stoppage time, Moises Caicedo added a fourth, crowning Chelsea champions of the Conference League. After the final whistle, Sancho made an effort to deliver his commiserations to Antony, who's also on loan from United this season.",
      "Chelsea can, however, pay a £5m penalty fee to cancel the deal. In order to remain compliant with profitability and sustainability rules, United require £14.58m for Sancho's signature this summer.",
      "As it stands, it remains to be seen whether or not the west London outfit look to keep him on a permanent basis. Regardless of whether Chelsea sign Sancho, Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't appear to be a fan of the winger.",
      "Speaking to BBC Sport in March, the British billionaire questioned why United forked out £73m for Sancho in 2021. Ratcliffe said: \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying [Jadon] Sancho.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things, and have to sort it out. For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea and we pay half his wages, we're paying £17m to buy him in the summer. It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future.\"",
      "Sancho appears to have settled in west London, having enjoyed a brilliant end to the season. Speaking to the official club website upon his arrival at Chelsea, he said: \"London is where I grew up and I’m happy to be back. Chelsea is iconic.",
      "\"My idols growing up were Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard and now I have the opportunity to play for this club like them. It’s a great feeling.\"",
      "Then, in November, Sancho added: \"For me, ever since I was growing up, Chelsea just seemed to be like a family, a winning culture. I remember when Chelsea were in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona.",
      "\"I was with my friend and he bet me…he said if Chelsea won he would do some sort of forfeit. I can’t remember the forfeit, I just remember that when Ramires scored that chip away, he was upset!",
      "\"And then obviously Fernando Torres scored that last-minute goal to close the game out. It was funny. Then, obviously, the final speaks for itself. Drogba coming in clutch.",
      "\"For them to just bounce back the way they did, it just shows the mentality of top players, top teams, and top coaches...\""

      "Manchester United's fast-approach in the summer transfer window to land Matheus Cunha has raised expectations around the club for next season. But if they don't build on it, it'll be for nothing.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished 15th in the Premier League and lost in the Europa League final meaning it is, officially, the club's worst season in 51 years. The Portuguese is being backed but a difficult start could see United repeat the Erik ten Hag sacking earlier this season.",
      "United need at least two or three new players through the door. After Cunha, a striker to be the focal point followed by another attacking-creator is expected to be prioritised. A new goalkeeper and midfielder are also being linked.",
      "As has been the case since January, player sales are going to play a crucial part in United getting the right signings through the door. Millions are expected to be raised through the sales of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho but Alejandro Garnacho's exit could work out a treat.",
      "The winger is increasingly likely to leave United this summer with Amorim understood to have informed him to find a new club. Garnacho nearly left the club in January and sparked further uncertainty with his comments in the aftermath of the Europa League defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Interest in Italy has been apparent since the winter with Napoli reportedly still keen. However, recent revelations have reported that AC Milan have discussed Garnacho internally amid the unsettling situation with Rafael Leao.",
      "According to Argentine outlet Ole, Milan have opened negotiations for Garnacho and believe £50million would be enough to get him out of Manchester and to the San Siro. Whilst that fee is slightly lower than the reported £65m that United would seek for the Argentine, accepting that proposal would be the perfect green light for Amorim's second signing.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is on United's radar and after scoring 20 Premier League goals this season, is destined for a move away from Brentford. Newcastle and Arsenal are also considering moves with the Bees reportedly demanding between £50m-£60m.",
      "\"I know that Bryan is very happy being here at Brentford, he's thriving, doing well and playing fantastic. What happens in the future? I don't know. I've said many times: we are a selling club. But at the same time we have to reinforce that there are 10 clubs in the world who aren't selling clubs.",
      "\"So, of course, if the right price - and that's going to be expensive - is coming, then I'm sure the club will be open for it. But I'm very happy he's here, and I'm convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.\"",
      "Selling Garnacho, a player who doesn't suit Amorim's system, to bring in Mbeumo - one of the Premier League's most consistent performers in the past 12 months - for the same price would be a masterstroke from Ineos."

      "It is claimed that United value Mainoo at around £70million, but the question is whether any foreign club would be able to afford that fee. Only Premier League clubs tend to pay that price, unless you are Real Madrid, who may be too big of a step up for the Englishman right now.",

      "With that in mind, departures are likely to outweigh the number of new arrivals this summer. Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Amid a lack of European football next season, United will not need to manage a squad as big as they have this season, meaning they are unlikely to require the same number of incomings as outgoings.",
      "Nevertheless, there is no doubt that head coach Ruben Amorim needs to add fresh blood and injections of quality, particularly in attacking areas. United struggled for goals domestically this season and desperately need to improve their attacking output ahead of next term.",
      "It is looking increasingly likely that Wolves ace Matheus Cunha will be drafted in as the club's first signing of the summer. The Brazilian has been identified to fill one of the two playmaker positions and United are expected to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Having played as a No.10 at Molineux, the former Atletico Madrid man is a suitable fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. The United boss wants an increased attacking presence buzzing around the central striker and Cunha fits the mould.",
      "As for bolstering the No.9 position, United have also made good progress with their identification process, long since pinpointing Ipswich Town's Liam Delap as an option.",
      "The 22-year-old, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, plundered 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League player, despite operating in a team that won just four games all season and was relegated to the Championship.",
      "Available for £30m via a release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's relegation, Delap is no stranger to United technical director Jason Wilcox from the time they spent together at City. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna confirmed last Friday that Delap is increasingly likely to leave Portman Road this summer.",
      "Already planning to spend north of £90m on two Premier League-ready players to strengthen their attack, United have also been credited with interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo by multiple outlets in the last day or so. The Cameroonian has enjoyed an excellent season for the Bees, scoring 20 Premier League goals.",
      "The jewel in Brentford's crown, Mbeumo, who was signed from French club Troyes in 2019, was only outscored in the Premier League this season by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22). He also registered seven assists.",
      "Capable of playing from the right wing or up front, Mbeumo is a suitable fit to operate close to Delap in the right-sided No.10 position. He also has the athleticism United so desperately need to add in this summer's window.",
      "Reportedly valued at around £50m, there is no doubt United will have to maximise the seller's market to go after Mbeumo's signature.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo, Cunha and Delap all being signed in one window is an ambitious thought. However, it is not beyond the realms of possibility if United manage to offload the likes of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony.",
      "United need to strengthen other areas beyond their attack, such as the centre of midfield, but bolstering their forward line is poised to take initial priority this summer. The club can ill-afford to be as limited up front again next term.",
      "Should Mbeumo, Delap and Cunha be signed this summer, they should form United's strongest attack, forcing Bruno Fernandes into a more reserved role and Amad the right wing-back berth. The aforementioned duo are two players the Reds must retain this summer amid their increased importance.",
      "There is also a case for United to strengthen in goal and possibly at wing-back. For now, though, bolstering the attack has to take priority.",
      "United's strongest line-up with three new signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Delap."

      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter. It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour. I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season but now it's a new season. I don't need rest.\"",
      "\"I think that is an important thing because I think one of the issues with youngsters is sometimes we push too much from the beginning, you have social media, all this pressure around young kids, I don't want to say any name. I believe in all of them and, like I said, you have surprises... This is a massive club, that is a big question in our club, putting our young kids in the pedestal and that is an important thing to change because we need to control that.\"",
      "\"Omar [Berrada] is here, he can explain better than me. We always prepare two plans, one with Champions League, one without Champions League. Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way, then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course, but our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, that is the future, is not going to change so much because we have the FFP rules, we are not allowed to do much this summer. It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\"",

      "\"A really tough season without trophies in the league. It's a really big club that is alive and change things… For some people it's hard to understand and see but I think we are improving as a team. That lack of goals punishes us in some games. If I have to choose a positive, it's that feeling in the stadium with the fans and that’s the beginning of something.\"",
      "\"The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball, the team has different moments and in different moments Bruno [Fernandes] takes responsibility. He's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\"",
      "\"I have the phone always on silent, especially in this occasion, it's a house alarm. When I'm away, I like to control my kids!\"",
      "\"First of all, I want to apologise for the house alarm. It's amazing to see even in difficult seasons to see how many fans this club has. It's our duty to be here, it's a pleasure, they are outside, following this club for many years and it’s really important to have that connection. It makes this club one of the best clubs in the world, so we are happy to be here. I see it first of all, every game we play we have a big responsibility, we want to respect all this attention, all this kindness from everybody, we want to have a good performance and we have a lot to do, like you saw this season, if there is any game to be played we are going to use it to improve the team, we have almost all of the squad here. Maz [Noussair Mazraoui] had an injury on Sunday but the rest are here, we also have young kids that have to understand what it means to play for Manchester United.

      "Manchester United are closer than ever to securing the £62.5million signing of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have moved quickly to improve Ruben Amorim's team after the club recorded their worst season in 51 years. Cunha was identified as a priority target rapidly and looks set to be the first new face through the door this summer.",
      "Reports on Tuesday indicated that United had opened talks with Wolves to agree a deal and it's been widely reported that the terms of the release clause in Cunha's recently signed contract at Molineux have been met.",
      "Cunha's contract outlines that a transfer fee is paid across three instalments including a first lump sum and two further payments over the next two years. However, United had tested the waters with a proposal to pay the £62.5m release clause over five years.",
      "The Brazilian is now set to undergo a medical after receiving permission from Wolves with the deal accelerating towards completion. And fortunately for United, they have received the biggest sign of approval from the 25-year-old's camp.",
      "Cunha's father, Carmelo, has recently liked Fabrizio Romano's popular 'Here we go!' update of Cunha's move to United on Instagram. It isn't the first time Carmelo has sparked excitement with supporters after liking a comment under one of the forward's posts reading: \"Welcome to United,\" earlier in the season.",
      "After Cunha completes his switch from Wolves, United are expected to push ahead with their interest for a centre-forward. Ipswich Town top-scorer Liam Delap is a strong candidate with his £30m release clause a key factor in the move.",

      "One of them is that Betis have got to fork out £300,000 to United if they win the Conference League final against Chelsea. It was conditional on Antony playing more than half of their matches in the competition since his arrival, but he has featured in every one.",

      "The payments are scheduled to be paid before Thursday, July 10, so that clubs can decide to apply them to either the 2024/25 or 2025/26 seasons. There was also specific bonuses for qualifying for the Champions League, but Betis failed to achieve that goal this season.",

      "Here is our Premier League disappointment XI, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Spurs all represented.",
      "",
      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nThere were still ‘best in the world’ shouts before the season started, but Martinez has emphatically proved otherwise.",
      "Six errors leading to a shot highlight the growing shakiness of the Argentina No.1, who more often than not cost his team rather than rescued them – though he still managed the latter a few times, admittedly.",
      "He’s nowhere near the world’s best now. His final-day c*ck-up played a bigger part than Villa’s disallowed goal and could well be his final act as an Aston Villa player. Quoting the Mailbox isn’t standard practice, but we’ll make an exception for this timeline: ‘1) Bring attention to yourself that want to leave the club, the game before last game where need a result, 2) Change your agent during the lead up to the big game, 3) Get yourself sent off during the big game’.",
      "",
      "RB: Rico Lewis (Manchester City)\nAlmost every Man City player has disappointed this season. Some did enough to haul them to third, but most went off the boil.",
      "Lewis looked destined for greatness, but this has been a tricky year. With the stars around him struggling, Lewis has looked more like a vulnerable kid than the composed upstart we saw last season. From looking alarmingly comfortable in midfield to being out of his depth, and from solid to defensively frail – next season’s huge. A loan feels beneath him.",
      "",
      "CB: Jean-Clair Todibo (West Ham)\nSir Jim Ratcliffe was willing to risk it all for this guy? For someone with such impeccable judgement, we are shocked that he wanted to spend a fortune on Todibo before UEFA slammed the door in his face.",
      "Manchester United’s loss was supposed to be West Ham’s gain, but the French centre-back had a poor season in a wildly underperforming team.",
      "Todibo played 27 league matches and his loan from Nice will become permanent in the summer for over £30million, for West Ham’s sins. Having officially splashed the cash, the Hammers will be desperate to see some improvement, especially when it comes to one-on-one defending as demonstrated at Ipswich on Sunday.",
      "",
      "CB: Radu Dragusin (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThere had to be some Spurs representation. They did finish 17th, after all. Bloody seventeenth. Still sounds ridiculous.",
      "Dragusin’s poor season has the caveat that he’s been out with an ACL injury since January, but before that, he was he all over the shop. He just seems to be a bad fit for Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs, but he came into the season off a really impressive Euro 2024 which adds to the disappointment.",
      "Being surpassed by Kevin Danso hasn’t helped – especially when the January signing is still no more than a back-up centre-back, but far more the right kind of back-up centre-back.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Igor Julio, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Lewis Dunk and Leny Yoro.",
      "",
      "LB: Leif Davis (Ipswich Town)\nThere were England call-up shouts for this guy when him and Ipswich were in the Championship. They’re going back down and we are not convinced Davis will be a transfer target for any Premier League club this summer.",
      "The Alfie Doughty comparisons were thrown around early, but Davis never came close. Just two assists – despite taking set-pieces all year – isn’t good enough. We expected more from him, and naively, Ipswich.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Ian Maatsen and Oleksandr Zinchenko.",
      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Ipswich Town)\nWe have no idea where poor Kalvin Phillips goes from here. Leeds United, probably. But will they even want their old fan favourite after a miserable campaign at another newly-promoted team? We’d be surprised, but there’s no future for him at Man City.",
      "The player who bossed games for Leeds and England looks long gone. Now 29, this summer is career-defining. He played just 30 minutes across Ipswich’s final nine league games.",
      "",
      "CM: Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nAfter a breakout season and a starring role at Euro 2024, Mainoo was meant to take the next step.",
      "United’s struggles aren’t on him, but we still expected more from someone who seemed ready to assume the role of a team leader. He’s not being written off – far from it – but that next step might not be in Manchester. Defeat in the Europa League final could force the club’s hand financially.",
      "Worryingly, he already looks a bit leggy. He’s dropped down Ruben Amorim’s pecking order, despite seemingly fitting the 3-4-3 like a glove.",
      "Dishonourable mentions: Mats Wieffer, Carlos Soler, Guido Rodriguez, Edson Alvarez, Ilkay Gundogan and Lucas Paqueta.",
      "",
      "RW: Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nFrom Premier League Player of the Season to Phlop of the Season.",
      "Problems in his personal life have contributed to a bitterly disappointing year, but we all know there is a world-class player in there. Getting adequate rest to recover physically and mentally will go a long way to Foden coming Back Stronger in 2025/26.",
      "Foden only scored or assisted in six games all season, with a purple patch in January (six goals, one assist in four games) followed by a costly mistake against Arsenal and a complete fade-out. The 24-year-old didn’t score or assist from February onwards.",
      "",
      "AM: Martin Odegaard (Arsenal)\nThe Arsenal captain fell from the highest high from every attacking midfielder in the Premier League, but not necessarily to the lowest low. Christopher Nkunku, Fabio Carvalho, Joshua Zirkzee and Lucas Paqueta arguably reached deeper depths of despair.",
      "Odegaard has been the heartbeat of this Arsenal team since 2021/22 but his performances undoubtedly dipped this campaign. The ankle injury he suffered in September clearly hindered him for the rest of the campaign as his influence waned.",
      "The Norwegian recorded assists in five of Arsenal’s last six Premier League matches but all they did was paper over the cracks, especially in the home defeat to Bournemouth.",
      "",

      "The gap between the Premier League and Championship has become a gulf. The last six teams promoted into the Premier League have been relegated straight back out of it.",
      "All the while, 17 teams become richer, more deeply entrenched and ever harder to shift. Will next season really be hugely different?",
      "There’s always been a gap between the Premier League and the Championship, obviously, but all our number-crunching a few years ago suggested that despite claims to the contrary, that gap had not really grown for about 25 years.",
      "It was there in the numbers. Sides going down to the second tier were no more likely to bounce straight back up than they’d ever been, and sides coming up to the top flight were no more likely to go straight back down than they’d ever been. The complaints about the growing gap in quality was, at that point, the kind of vague ‘sort of feels like it though doesn’t it’ claim that we’re all prone to after a pint.",
      "That’s changed completely since the last massive increase in TV money. The distance between the Premier League and the Championship is now an absolute chasm.",
      "It’s not that the second tier has got worse, either. I’ve seen more Championship football over the past 16 years than any other level of football, and can tell you the standard has risen if anything. One colleague told me in a press room this season that he had been watching old mid-table Premier League games from 2005 as research for a piece, and that it looked exactly like the Championship does now.",
      "The standard in the Premier League, as an average across the division, is just now so unbelievably high, because even a pretty mediocre side can go out and outspend all but the biggest behemoths in European football for transfer fees and wages. We got something like confirmation of that in the Europa League: Manchester United and Tottenham both reached the final – and deservedly so – despite being absolute crap in the Premier League, finishing 15th and 17th.",
      "That should be a good thing, but it is desperately hurting the case of any newly-promoted sides, for whom the only reasonable expectation now is that they will go straight back down to the Championship…where the expectation now (admittedly not fulfilled this season, especially not by League One-bound Luton) is that they will go straight back up.",
      "The Premier League has always been depressingly myopic and uncaring about this kind of thing, because they sit separate from the rest of the pyramid and almost exclusively vote in ways that assume that they will be Premier League clubs forever and never ever get relegated.",
      "If that was short-sighted and self-defeating before, it’s now actually becoming the case – and is only likely to get worse. Premier League votes generally only need 16 out of 20 clubs to vote for them. In the current state of affairs, 17 of those clubs actually are more or less entrenched in the top flight unless they right royally screw it up in massive, massive fashion. Good for those clubs. Terrible for everyone else, including the neutral fan.",
      "We need some jeopardy back, and honestly don’t think five up, five down would be a bad idea at this point. It might at the very least get the Premier League clubs thinking about what life is like in the second tier and why narrowing the gap again would be to everybody’s benefit.",
      "You only need look at Spurs and United this season to see why and how.",
      "There’s an argument that like United, Spurs were so focused on the Europa League towards the end of the season that their league form was basically an inconvenient irrelevance to them. Even if it’s subconscious…who cares if you constantly lose when you already know you can’t get relegated even while finishing with a paltry 38 points?",
      "Well…the fans do, for one, and they were not shy about making their feelings clear.",
      "Tottenham produced lovely stuff at times – for much of the season, Liverpool were the only side to outscore them – but they were callow, callow, callow. Who’d have thought that’s what you’d get from not just building your recruitment policy around youth, but making it more or less the only criterion?",
      "That excuse only goes so far, though; Chelsea and Brighton both had younger sides on average than Tottenham this season, and they did alright in the end.",
      "While the fans have concentrated their ire mostly on Daniel Levy, the neutral’s glare has generally fallen on Ange Postecoglou and his at times stubborn insistence on ignoring some simple pragmatic steps to improve his side’s form in favour of pursuing a style of play that often feels too risky to be worthwhile.",
      "Chelsea had a similar problem for a while, but even Enzo Maresca made adaptations to address that, one-nilling their way through the closing stages of the season to secure their Champions League place.",
      "Spurs will be joining them there, of course. The Europa League trophy provided some vindication for Postecoglou, though it was amusing that their 1-0 victory in the final was almost a complete departure from what we had seen from Spurs all season. It was the third time they had won a game 1-0; the others were in their League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool, and against Manchester United again in the league.",
      "We will say that despite all that…we still have a soft spot for Postecoglou and for Spurs, if only because it’s hard to dislike an amusingly chippy manager who sticks to his attacking guns so much. They are our early shout for being the most interesting side to watch next season, because it feels like they’re either going to be great or terrible with no in between.",
      "But if they are terrible, is it too much to ask that maybe that be accompanied by some actual consequences?"

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 18:52, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted his side may \"need the boos\"  after they suffered a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in the first fixture of their post-season tour.",
      "Harry Maguire captained the side as first-teamers Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, Andre Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund all started for United in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Jonny Evans and Amad Diallo were among 11 changes at half-time with the score locked at 0-0, but Maung Maung Lwin netted a 71st-minute winner for the South-East Asia XI to inflict another defeat on Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",
      "\"It's like the way of playing, if they see that it's not working, they will change the way they behave. But I felt when we finished and walked away, the supporters were with us. But, again, let's wait for the next season.\"",
      "Amorim described United's season as \"disastrous\" after they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final - and their poor form continued at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "Garnacho played the entire second half amid doubts over his future at the club, as did Fernandes, who has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "A host of academy youngsters were given minutes which will be seen as the only positive from the defeat in front of a crowd of 72,550, more than 6,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "United will play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday for their final fixture of the tour which is reportedly set to earn the club £8m.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada said before the friendly defeat that United will balance \"ambition\" with the need to be \"prudent\" in the transfer market.",
      "United's defeat to Spurs meant they missed out on silverware and Champions League qualification worth an estimated £100m, and the club have wasted little time trying to improve Amorim's side with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha set to sign.",
      "It could start a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings at Old Trafford, with chief executive Berrada confident about United's plans.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say that we've been planning for many months now,\" he told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve, so (technical director) Jason (Wilcox), his team, Ruben have been in talks for many months.",
      "\"Now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent but at the same time with ambition.\"",
      "United's defeat in Malaysia came a week to the day since their Europa League final loss in Spain and just three days on from beating Aston Villa 2-0 in their Premier League finale at Old Trafford.",

      "\"The owner has also been very supportive in this transition year and now we just need to work really hard and do everything we can to bring the club back to the top.",
      "\"I'm very excited about what's coming ahead of us. Like Ruben said, now we just need to work really hard as a unit, as a club and I'm sure the good days will be back, as he said.\""

      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 12:44, UK",
      "Manchester United will invest in new players this summer, but without Champions League football next season, the club does not need a big squad, says Ruben Amorim.",
      "United recorded their worst-ever Premier League campaign after finishing 15th in the table, losing 18 games in the process, and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final means no European football next season.",
      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",

      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "He won two domestic cups in his two-and-a-half years in charge at Old Trafford but was fired after the club's worst start to a season, with four defeats in nine league games.",
      "Speaking in his first press conference after the appointment was announced, Ten Hag said: \"Bayer is one of the best clubs in Germany and also belongs to the expanded European elite.",
      "\"The club offers excellent conditions, and the discussions with the officials have impressed me greatly.",

      "\"Our visions of football align. With technically demanding and dominant football, we want to pursue the highest goals in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and Champions League.\""
