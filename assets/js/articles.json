      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season, but the 18-year-old is in no rush to sign a new contract despite the potential for a major pay rise",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has quickly become a key player for Manchester United this season, prompting speculation he could be rewarded with a bumper new long-term contract.",
      "The 18-year-old first impressed in pre-season, but had to wait until November to make his first appearance of the campaign after suffering an ankle injury in a friendly match against Real Madrid.",
      "However, since starring in United's 3-0 win over Everton, Mainoo has cemented himself as one of the first names on the team sheet for Erik ten Hag. Despite his remarkable rise and the potential lure of a new big money deal, the Daily Mail are reporting that Mainoo is in no rush to sign a fresh contract.",
      "The report states the player's camp are content to let him continue developing for now, with his current deal set to run until June 2027 but also including the option of a further year. As a result there is 'no panic or rush to get back to the negotiating table before the end of the season'.",
      "\"I've said it in the past - I've seen him play for the under-18s two or three years ago and I said to a friend who was in Manchester who wanted to see some youth games, I said the name of Kobbie, without knowing he was going to be this talented and this player. The talent was there. But he's better as a kid than a player. He will be in the future equally.\"",
      "Mainoo has started alongside Casemiro in recent weeks and Ten Hag believes that playing with the five-time Champions League winner is having a huge effect on the youngster's progress. \"We are happy to have him (Casemiro) back and when he plays together with Mainoo, I think they can benefit each other,\" Ten Hag said.",
      "\"There is a bond there. Casa takes that responsibility of talking to Kobbie. I see it in the dressing room, I see it on the pitch, training and in games. You see the impact of a player like Casemiro when he's there.",
      "\"He gives you calmness and composure on the ball, and he gives you options. We are happy he is back and Kobbie Mainoo can learn a lot from him. We are happy to have him (Casemiro) back and when he plays together with Mainoo, I think they can benefit each other.",
      "\"Kobbie is coached very well, but Casemiro has so much experience - so he will learn from it and even accelerate his development.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag did not give Anthony Elanga many opportunities last season and the 21-year-old forward therefore decided to leave for Nottingham Forest over the summer",
      "Anthony Elanga has explained why he decided to leave Manchester United for Nottingham Forest.",
      "Elanga signed a five-year contract with Forest in July after they agreed to pay United £15million for his services. The Sweden international came through the United academy and made 55 appearances for the first team, contributing four goals and four assists.",
      "He made his breakthrough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but found things more difficult under Erik ten Hag’s management, starting just five times in the Premier League last season and failing to score. The 21-year-old has made a good start at Forest, with five goals and six assists in 25 games and is pleased with his decision to leave his boyhood club.",
      "“Was Ten Hag the reason I left United? No, I wouldn't say that,” Elanga told SoccerNews.nl. “I just wanted to play, that was especially important to me. I'm young and I don't want to sit on the bench all season, you know? When you're young you want to play, you want to make mistakes, you want to take risks. But he wasn't the reason for my leaving. There I mainly focused on myself, not on others.”",
      "Elanga raised eyebrows in December when he said Forest’s 2-1 win over United was “personal” due to struggles in the 2022/23 season at his old club. He feels he has proven himself at Forest after failing to earn many opportunities under Ten Hag, but a few months down the road he has a measured opinion of Ten Hag.",
      "“Of course I also saw what he did at Ajax,” he said. “But when you come to England everything is different. He has improved several players, for example Ryan Gravenberch, who now plays for Liverpool. But I just wanted to take my chance and go somewhere else. And that was a good decision, because I am enjoying myself at Forest.”",
      "Elanga’s struggles came partly due to the competition in wide positions at United, with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Facundo Pellistri among the options available to Ten Hag. Antony’s arrival from Ajax for £86m in the summer of 2022 was a particular blow to Elanga, but he refused to lay the blame on the Brazilian.",
      "“Antony is a great player and a beautiful person,” he said. “We had a lot of contact when I was at United and we still talk sometimes now. I am confident that he will score a lot of goals there, I could already see that during the training sessions. I believe in God and he told me to go to Nottingham and Antony is still at United. But he will really be successful there.”",

      "Pavard was linked with a move to Old Trafford last summer, but ultimately ended up joining Inter Milan instead. However, it is claimed that United remain interested in signing the versatile defender and would be willing to offer Lindelof to Inter in an attempt to sweeten the deal.",
      "United have triggered an option to extend Lindelof's contract until 2025, but that was only to protect his value in the transfer market. The report adds that he is likely to be sold in the summer whether the deal for Pavard goes through or not, with several Saudi Pro League clubs interested in his services.",

      "\"Of course Casemiro was off-side from the free-kick that led to the corner - that led to the goal! BeinSPORTS viewers knew that on Sunday when Andy and I pointed it out. The assistant should’ve seen it. Casemiro made himself active when he challenged for the ball,\" Keys wrote in his blog.",
      "\"There was no way VAR could get involved though because the incident didn’t lead immediately to the goal. It was never a free-kick mind you. Having worked Fernandes out referees have got to be as strong with Rashford now. He should’ve been booked for diving, not rewarded for his cheating.\"",

      "In response, a spokesperson said : \"We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.\"",

      "The Ineos chief is set to take full control of the sporting side of the business and he has already put aside funds to improve United's infrastructure. \"Sir Jim will provide a $300 million (£236m) fund intended to enable future investment into the club's infrastructure at Old Trafford, comprising $200 million (£157m) paid upon the closing of the transaction and a further $100 million (£78m) by the end of 2024,\" the club revealed in a statement back in December.",
      "Reports have claimed that Ratcliffe wants to turn Old Trafford into a 'Wembley of the North' and he has held several meetings with Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to discuss his plans for the club.",
      "\"The first thing I would just say is it's good to be able to have a conversation about the future and how we might support the club's ambitions,\" Burnham said in an interview with the Manchester Evening News.",

      "Both Bayern stars are due to be out of contract in 2025, making them more attainable for the Red Devils this summer. United are already claimed to have drawn up a six-man shortlist ahead of the next transfer window, notably the first which will directly involve inco-ing part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "But ex-Red Devils striker Louis Saha would prefer his old club to target two alternative players in Kimmich and Davies. German midfielder Kimmich has been both Bayern and his country's linchpin for much of the last decade, while Canada international Davies is considered one of the world's best left-backs, boasting blistering speed.",
      "\"They are two extremely experienced players, especially Kimmich,\" Saha told Betfred. \"Kimmich would obviously be a great fit because he's one of the fittest players in Europe and is capable of running games and is very slick. He and Davies are both quality players, there's no doubting that.\"",
      "The duo have already been linked with moves to Old Trafford due to their uncertain futures, although Barcelona are known admirers of Kimmich, while Real Madrid have been tipped to sign Davies. It's also been reported that like in the case of Mason Mount last summer, United are keen to snap up players who've entered the final 12 months of their deals and are facing pressure to be sold.",
      "Saha, however, has admitted that their plan might not prove to be a success. \"Going for players with one year remaining on their contract is a smart strategy, but sometimes it doesn't work out,\" the Frenchman, 45, explained.",
      "\"At this moment, Mason Mount hasn't been a success at Manchester United, so ultimately it's dependent on the character of the players, their suitability to the Premier League, the style of the team and many other factors.",
      "\"Other teams will be interested in these players if their contracts are running down, so it won't be easy for Manchester United to pull off any of these signings. If Manchester United are unable to offer these players Champions League next season, then that will be an advantage to certain other clubs looking to sign them.\"",
      "Your turn! Should Man Utd sign Joshua Kimmich and Alphonso Davies? Let us know your verdict in the comments section.",
      "Signing stars of Kimmich and Davies' calibre would be vastly different from the aforementioned six targets who've been identified by United. Those half a dozen include a number of young centre-backs, namely Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, Nice stalwart Jean-Clair Todibo, Leny Yoro of Lille and Benfica's Antonio Silva.",
      "Also shortlisted in attack is Wolves winger Pedro Neto as well as Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. Both players would command significant fees.",

      "The management impact of former Manchester United star Michael Carrick was staggering after he took over at the Riverside Stadium, nearly leading Middlesbrough back to the Premier League while influencing his players",
      "Former Manchester City goalkeeper Zack Steffen has revealed how the blunt advice of former Manchester United and England star Michael Carrick inspired him to \"get a hold\" of his career.",
      "The United States men's national team star was a marquee loan addition for the Teesiders from Manchester City back in 2022, moving to the Riverside Stadium in the hope of inspiring their promotion push. After serving as back-up to Ederson and as Pep Guardiola's pick in the club's EFL Cup final success in 2021, he arrived with significant pedigree but the feeling that his career could come to a screeching halt if he didn't make changes.",
      "The American and his teammates struggled during the early months in the North East, as the club quickly found themselves languishing down the bottom of the EFL Championship table. Fast forward to the end of the campaign, though, and Steffen would leave Middlesbrough having gained some invaluable experience.",
      "The major inspiration behind this stark reversal in fortunes was former Old Trafford star Carrick, who took over the reins as head coach from Chris Wilder in October of that year. In the end, Steffen, the 29-time international with the United States, played 42 league games as Boro made the playoffs before bowing out versus Coventry City.",
      "Carrick assumed the hotseat in October 2022, with Middlesbrough languishing in 21st place in the second tier standings, having picked up just 17 points from their opening 16 games. Situated a single point above the drop zone, he masterminded a major turnaround in the remaining months of the campaign.",
      "Now, Steffen has reflected on the impact Carrick was able to have on his career during their short association with each other in the Championship. Describing how the ex-England star galvanised the dressing room, he told The Mirror on a conference call: \"He was amazing, we were struggling when he came in as manager. We were struggling with self-confidence and the team’s confidence and he just came in and said ‘Guys, let’s just have fun. We play this sport to have fun.'\"",
      "For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to   The Mirror US   .",
      "\"So he just wanted us to go out there and to enjoy it and the time that we have because it goes by quick.\"",
      "Steffen added of the frank assessment he received from Carrick: \"I remember him saying so many times that ‘careers just go like that [clicking his fingers],\" before going on to reveal the key message his mentor tried to impart upon him, adding: \"'Mine just went like that so you just really have to get a hold of it and be as present as possible and work hard every day.'\"",
      "\"He is such a good guy off the field and his love and motivation to build his players and get Middlesbrough up to the Premier League is there and it was just a privilege to work under a class player and such an amazing guy as well,\" Steffen continued. \"He brought so much fun and joy to Middlesbrough.",
      "The 29-year-old eventually returned to his native USA as he officially brought his time at parent club Manchester City to a close in January of this year. He is now preparing for the new MLS season with the Colorado Rapids as he also looks to regain his No. 1 jersey from Matt Turner for the national team."

Silva’s last eight goals in the competition have all come in the knock-out stages - and it’s crazy to think that City would have sold a player who truly embodies Guardiola’s philosophy if Barcelona had come up with the cash a couple of years ago.",
      "‌The only disappointment for last season’s Treble winners was that they didn’t put the contest out of sight before the return. Copenhagen’s goal, a smart finish by debut-boy Magnus Mattsson to cancel out Kevin De Bruyne’s third-minute opener, only came courtesy of a terrible mistake by City keeper Ederson.",
      "This was the Danish champions’ first competitive game for 63 days - and when they weren’t chasing shadows they were reduced to putting the boot in. Diogo Goncalves’ cynical hack at Jack Grealish’s ankle forced the midfielder off after 20 minutes - and it looked like a bad injury.",
      "City are now unbeaten in 18 Champions League games. If they continue that run all the way to the Wembley final they will break the record held by Sir Alex Ferguson’s United if they retain the trophy. Guardiola has often been accused of complicating things at the business end of the tournament. Monaco, Anfield, Lisbon and Porto are all painful reminders.",
      "‌But the City boss played his strongest hand to beat Inter Milan last June - and in the land of Hans Christian Anderson there were no Emperor’s New Clothes. Ten of Guardiola’s team also started in Istanbul - and Phil Foden played for almost an hour after De Bruyne’s hamstring snapped.",
      "Copenhagen coach Jacob Neestrup had demanded a Viking welcome - and the home fans responded by becoming a constant swaying army of berserkers. But City could have put the tie to bed inside 10 minutes when they should have scored three goals.",
      "De Bruyne glanced a free header wide close-range and Ruben Dias’ powerful downward nod from six yards was scooped out by Copenhagen’s stand-in keeper Kamil Grabara, formerly of Liverpool.",
      "The inevitable eventually happened when De Bruyne took Foden’s pass at a tight angle on the right and with home defenders expecting a shot, the Belgian placed a measured shot in at the far post. Silva’s cross came back off the post after clipping the head of Denis Varro and Foden forced Grabara into a low save.",
      "‌Erling Haaland then sprung into action with a spectacular scissors-kick that flew just over. Yet astonishingly, the home side were level in the 34th minute when Ederson’s woeful kick led to their first attack and Mattsson punished him with a deadly finish from 20 yards.",
      "Before Copenhagen could dream of claiming another Mancunian scalp, the visitors went ahead again on the stroke of half-time. Guardiola says he doesn’t coach tackles. But De Bruyne’s blockbuster challenge on Mattsson forced the ball through to Silva to flick a clever finish over Grabara.",
      "City had marginally less control after the break but still maintained possession at close to 80 percent. Both De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku were denied by flying Grabara saves. But it was still job done and City wrapped up the win when Foden made it 3-1 in stoppage time.",

      "The Premier League have now ratified Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal to acquire a 25 per cent stake in Manchester United and the INEOS chairman is already stepping up his transfer plans",
      "Manchester United are set to face competition from Tottenham in the race to sign highly-rated Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Branthwaite, 21, is being eyed by United chiefs to spearhead a youthful recruitment drive led by incoming part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. INEOS chairman Ratcliffe, who's on the verge of becoming a 25 per cent stakeholder in United, received official ratification from the Premier League on Tuesday and it's expected that he'll be given the green light by the FA either this week or not.",
      "Ratcliffe's £1.3billion agreement with the Glazers also hands him control of the Red Devils' football operations and the opportunity to instill his focus of signing homegrown players. Branthwaite is in the midst of a true breakthrough season at Goodison Park, having enjoyed a loan spell with PSV Eindhoven last term working under ex-United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "But it's not just the Red Devils who are interested in signing the England hopeful, as the Daily Mail claim that Tottenham have stepped up their efforts to sign him. Arsenal, Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid have also made enquiries, so United supporters will be pleased to know that Branthwaite is just one name on Ratcliffe's six-man shortlist.",
      "Three more up-and-coming young centre-backs have been mentioned during internal discussions such as Jean-Clair Todibo, who plays for INEOS-owned Nice. The 24-year-old Frenchman is part of the best defence in Ligue 1 this season, but it's not just Todibo who's impressing in France's first tier.",
      "18-year-old Lille starlet Leny Yoro is another defensive option for the Red Devils, although they'll likely face competition from Paris Saint-Germain. Benfica's Antonio Silva, 20, is also someone who United are believed to be keeping tabs on.",
      "There's also a focus on signing a Premier League-proven attacker, with Wolves winger Pedro Neto on the list of potential targets alongside Crystal Palace's Michael Olise. It appears that Olise is a more concrete option for Ratcliffe and co, with a release clause - worth in the region of £60million - set to become active this summer.",
      "Your turn! Who should Jarrad Branthwaite join - Man Utd or Tottenham? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "To do any major deals, however, the Red Devils will need to free-up cash and keep themselves away from any trouble relating to Financial Fair play.",
      "Two big names who could be off United's wage book by July are Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial, both of whom are out of contract at the end of this season. Manager Erik ten Hag insists that decisions haven't yet been made but, especially in Martial's case, it's looking increasingly unlikely that the Red Devils will extend either of the duo's stays.",

      "Former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has emerged as a surprise contender to succeed Xavi Hernandez at Barcelona next season.",
      "Rangnick, 65, has a rich coaching pedigree and is revered in his native Germany but endured a disastrous spell at Old Trafford after agreeing to step in on a temporary following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking back in November 2021.",
      "The former RB Leipzig coach has been in charge of the Austria national team since leaving United and successfully guided them to qualification for next summer's European Championships - a feat that has seemingly not gone unnoticed in Europe.",
      "According to Sport, Barcelona president Joan Laporta is a big fan of Rangnick and is said to be enamoured with the idea of appointing him once Xavi steps down from his role in the summer.",
      "Despite his underwhelming stint in the Premier League, Rangnick's reputation as a developer of top young talent has endured, while the influential role he played in RB Leipzig's rise has also not been forgotten.",
      "While Laporta is a fan of Rangnick, there are other candidates in the frame to succeed Xavi, who announced last month that this season would be his last as head coach.",
      "Outgoing Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has been linked with the role but is unlikely to take another role immediately given he has previously spoken of plans for a sabbatical.",
      "While Rangnick has managed to repair his reputation on the international stage with Austrian national team, he was originally supposed to stay on at Manchester United on a consultancy basis after his stint in the dugout.",
      "He had agreed a two-year deal to transition into an upstairs role in order to work alongside a new manager, however, that agreement was cancelled shortly after Erik ten Hag was prised away from Ajax by United.",
      "Rangnick's exit was subsequently communicated by United, with reports at the time outlining that Ten Hag refused a face-to-face meeting with his predecessor before taking charge. Rangnick only spoke to the Dutchman briefly over the phone before moving on.",
      "In total, Rangnick was at the helm for around six months as United limped to a bitterly disappointing sixth-place finish. He won just 11 of his 29 matches in charge of the team.",

      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is already making plans ahead of the summer transfer window and Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite has emerged as a top target",
      "Manchester United have identified Jarrad Branthwaite as their primary summer transfer target following his impressive breakthrough at Everton.",
      "Erik ten Hag is expected to be backed in the summer transfer window after the Red Devils failed to strengthen in January and it has already been outlined that the Dutchman has designs on overhauling his defensive options, with both Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans out of contract at the end of the season.",
      "There are also doubts over the long-term future of Victor Lindelof, whose contract was extended by 12 months earlier in the campaign. He could still be sold, especially given United in the market for two young centre-backs.",
      "That's according to a new report from The Mail, who claim that Branthwaite has emerged as United's top target. The highly-rated 21-year-old has enjoyed a fine season for Everton and is attracting interest from other top clubs including Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid.",
      "While United also have other names in mind to bolster their defence, it's outlined in the report that Branthwaite is United's primary target. Tottenham, like United, are also pushing hard to sign the centre-back ahead of the summer window.",
      "Branthwaite has already been given a glowing endorsement from United icon Ruud van Nistelrooy, who coached the youngster during his stint on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "The former PSV head coach said of Branthwaite last year: \"He is a great talent. The boy is young, but he has a future. He is good on the ball, can play on the left or the right of centre-back because he is two-footed. He has height and speed, so he is very complete.\"",
      "As well as renovating their defence, United are also in the market for attacking reinforcements and Crystal Palace 's Michael Olise is a target.",
      "Wolves wide-man Pedro Neto has also been touted as a possible signing according to the same report, although it should be noted that - like with Brantwaite - there is plenty of rival interest in the Portuguese star, who is also admired by Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt, who previously worked with Ten Hag at Ajax, is also understood to be on Manchester United's radar and is seemingly surplus to requirements at the German champions.",

      "De Ligt, 24, came through the academy at Ajax where he worked with Erik ten Hag before lucrative transfers to Juventus and Bayern, however, speculation over the defender's long-term future has been rumbling on for months.",
      "A Premier League move has been touted on more than one occasion and it's already been reported that United have plans to overhaul their defence in the summer. Acquiring De Ligt - a player he knows well - would certainly appeal to Ten Hag, who has previously turned to players he worked with in Amsterdam since taking the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "And Bayern would likely be open to doing a deal with their European rivals given that German outlet Bild claim De Ligt is not wanted by Tuchel, who is unimpressed with the Dutchman.",
      "De Ligt was an unused substitute in Bayern's chastening 3-0 loss against title rivals Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend with the defender later confirming to fans that he is fully fit.",
      "Tuchel preferred on-loan Tottenham defender Eric Dier to De Ligt, effectively relegating the former Ajax man to fourth-choice in the Bayern Munich pecking order.",

      "The deal, which will see Ratcliffe acquire a 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club, will give Ineos control of sporting operations at the club, meaning Ratcliffe and his team will have a big say in recruitment moving forward.",
      "Full ratification of the deal, which is now expected imminently, comes some 14 months after the Glazer family first invited takeover proposals from interested parties.",

      "This could happen in a few days and Ratcliffe has already made significant moves in his new role as head of United's football operations.",
      "Ratcliffe has offered to buy 25 per cent of the United's A shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and he has until just before midnight on Friday to complete this transaction.",
      "This will go through as long as he has the approval of the Premier League and the FA, which should be formalities. The shares will then be sold and transferred to his control. United confirmed Ratcliffe's latest successive step when the club said: \"We have secured the approval of the Premier League.\"",
      "\"Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s acquisition of 25 per cent of Manchester United FC, and further investment of $300 million in the club, has been approved by the Premier League Board following the completion of the Owners’ and Directors’ Test (OADT),\" a Premier League statement read.",
      "\"The Board agreed to the change of the club’s ownership structure last week, and this has now been officially ratified by an Independent Oversight Panel. The Premier League’s Owners’ Charter has also been signed.",
      "'This is the first acquisition of Control to be reviewed and approved by a new Independent Oversight Panel following changes to the process which were agreed by Premier League clubs in March 2023. The Premier League now awaits confirmation of the transaction’s completion.\"",
      "The club announced the deal with Ratcliffe on Christmas Eve and the INEOS boss is paying £1.25bn for his 25 per cent stake in the club. United's 14-month sale process is nearly over and Ratcliffe has fought long and hard to come on board.",
      "He initially was interested in assuming full control of United from the Glazers, when they put the club up for sale in November 2022. Ratcliffe fought off interest from Qatar and Sheikh Jassim, but the Glazers were reluctant to give up control. The two sides finally agreed on their deal which sees Ratcliffe come in as a minority shareholder.",
      "He has also agreed to take over the club's football operations. Although Ratcliffe has yet to officially come on board, he has wasted no time in making his mark. Richard Arnold has left as CEO and Ratcliffe has lured Moroccan Omar Berrada across from Manchester City to replace him.",
      "Ratcliffe has also brought Sir Dave Brailsford on board as his right-hand man and the former cycling supremo has quit INEOS Grenadiers to focus on his new work at United.",
      "Jean-Claude Blanc has joined Ratcliffe and Brailsford on the United board and he has a wealth of experience from his time at Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Ratcliffe has much more to do and he is assessing John Murtough's role as director of football and, of course, Erik ten Hag's as manager.",

      "Yes, that’s right. Ten Hag may be a Red, but he’s most-definitely in the Blue corner when it comes to the Champions League.",
      "The Premier League badly needs to boost its UEFA coefficient after Ten Hag’s Manchester United and Newcastle exited the Champions League in the knock-out round. Ten Hag needs City, and Arsenal for that matter, to go deep in the competition and boost the Premier League’s hopes of getting an extra spot in next season’s expanded competition.",
      "That would mean fifth place in the Premier League earning the lucky recipients a coveted spot in the Champions League.",
      "This is hugely relevant to United as they battle for the top places and they are sixth, five points behind fifth-placed Aston Villa. Fourth place would guarantee United’s passage back into the Champions League, but Tottenham, with all their stars back, look in no mood to give that up.",
      "The stakes could not be higher for ten Hag and his future as United boss is riding on this.",
      "Finish outside the Champions League places, and he will almost certainly be sacked, as was the case with his compatriot Louis van Gaal, who suffered the indignity of finding out Jose Mourinho was replacing him in the hours after winning the FA Cup in 2016.",

They have won their last three Premier League games in impressive style, overtaking West Ham and closing in on Villa in the Champions League race. Ten Hag finally has momentum for the first time since lifting the Carabao Cup last season and United appear in the mood to do something this season.",
      "Ten Hag has luck on his side, which should never be underestimated, and any other manager would surely have been sacked in December when United exited not only the Champions League, but Europe.",
      "But Ratcliffe was still finalising buying his minority shareholding in United and agreeing to take over the running of all football operations. He did not need finding a new manager added to his huge to-do list, especially when United could not have got the top-quality candidate they would have wanted. United are also still scarred by the memory of Wreck-It-Ralph [Rangnick] and interim bosses when the club hit new lows as it drifted along, rudderless.",
      "Ten Hag must now convince Ratcliffe he is still the man for United when May arrives and clubs traditionally change managers. Qualifying for the Champions League would be his ace card, even more so than winning the FA Cup.",
      "All this brings fifth-place into play and if supporting City and Arsenal in the Champions League were not unpalatable enough, ten Hag could secretly root for Liverpool in the Europa League.",
      "Victory for the Merseyside Reds would also boost the Premier League’s coefficient and possibly make United and ten Hag holders of the Champions League’s golden ticket.",

      "Southgate watched Mainoo, who has already played for England at Under 16s, Under 18s and Under 19s level, during United's trip to Aston Villa on Sunday. However, the Stockport-born midfielder is also eligible for Ghana through his parents and is being targeted to represent the African nation.",

Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents, and the association would love to work with him and many like him at home and abroad.\"",
      "But according to the Daily Mail, Mainoo is expected to keep his options open until he is confident of securing a place in the England squad, which is not likely until the autumn at the earliest. Other than the European Championships, the Three Lions do not have any other competitive matches until September.",
      "Despite this, the FA are confident of securing Mainoo's services. As per FIFA rules, a player can switch their allegiances at any time if they have only played friendlies, while those under the age of 21 are able to move after three years should they only have played less than three competitive games.",
      "England face a double-header at Wembley against Brazil and Belgium in two international friendlies in March as they ramp up their preparations for Euro 2024. This is before Southgate's side take on Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland in their final two matches before the tournament starts in June.",
      "Although Mainoo may not get his senior chance yet, Southgate is set to recommend that the midfielder is promoted into Lee Carsley's Under 21s squad moving forward. The young Lions are next in action when they face Azerbaijan and Luxembourg in two U21 Euro qualifiers next month.",
      "Mainoo has become an important member of the United side in recent weeks, partnering Casemiro in a double pivot. This has allowed Bruno Fernandes license to venture further forward, with Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford providing support for Rasmus Hojlund up front.",

      "The Manchester United boss worked with Haller at the start of his career in charge of Utrecht and later signed him for Ajax. And the Dutchman became a big source of personal support to the player when he was winning his battle with testicular cancer a couple of years ago.",
      "When the former West Ham forward scored the historic winner for Ivory Coast in their 2-1 victory over Nigeria in Abidjan, the Dutchman was watching on television just hours after he had guided United to a vital Premier League win at Aston Villa. Ten Hag admitted it was an emotional moment.",
      "He said: “I had direct contact with Seb on Sunday night after the final. There has also been frequent contact during his period of illness. I tried to support him as much as possible. Of course, he had only been away from Ajax for a fortnight when the illness was diagnosed. For me too, that was a huge blow.",
      "“A sportsman in the prime of his life with a young family of three children and then such an illness. The way he dealt with it deserves great respect. He did not flee in anger but accepted it immediately and took everything he could to improve his chances of recovery and be resilient.",
      "“He has fought his way back tremendously and then it is great that this is now followed by such a well-deserved sporting highlight.” Haller was told he had cancer in July 2022, just weeks after joining Borussia Dortmund from Ajax. He moved to the Amsterdam club in January 2021 after an 18-month spell with West Ham following a £45million move from Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "But the striker has never forgotten the role Ten Hag has played in his career and the pair kept in touch when the striker was undergoing extensive chemotherapy treatment to beat his disease. He returned to action with Borussia Dortmund last season - only to miss a crucial penalty in a 2-2 draw with Mainz on the final day of the season which cost his club the Bundesliga title.",
      "Ten Hag said: “This highlight is so much to Seb's credit after everything he has been through. His story is of course super emotional. From a sporting point of view, it was difficult for him. Last year he missed the title with Borussia Dortmund and missed a penalty in the decisive match.",
      "“That he then is now an African champion is great. Seb is a fantastic personality, a real team player. That attitude doesn't suit a striker, but that's how he always sets himself up. He is modest and humble, just a great player to have in your squad.",
      "“And he radiates calmness and tranquillity. You can see that in his game. He is imperturbable and therefore able to score such a decisive goal at such an important moment in difficult circumstances.”",

      "The offer was due to expire on Tuesday night but the bid, which was part of Ratcliffe’s deal to become the minority owner of the Premier League club will now be extended. On Christmas Eve it was announced that the Ineos chief had agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the Manchester outfit.",
      "It was confirmed that Ratcliffe would offer to buy up to 25 per cent of all Class A shares at a price of 33 US dollars (£26) per share. That is alongside him buying Class B shares held by the Glazer family, who have given him control of the footballing operations at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite his continued presence in recent weeks the deal to officially bring Ratcliffe on board has not been completed, although it is imminent. Already the billionaire has begun influencing things behind the scenes, helping bring in a new CEO from rivals Manchester City.",

      "The Red Devils secured the three points late on at Villa Park to record another win and further their unlikely push for a top four spot. Rasmus Hojlund converted their opener from close range after he latched onto a second ball from a corner.",
      "Keys though has pointed out the catalogue of events that led to United being fortunate in scoring the game's first goal. Firstly he highlighted that Casemiro was offside from the free-kick before the corner, but also called out Rashford for diving to earn himself a foul.",
      "He wrote in his blog : \"Of course Casemiro was off-side from the free-kick that led to the corner - that led to the goal! BeinSPORTS viewers knew that on Sunday when Andy and I pointed it out. The assistant should’ve seen it. Casemiro made himself active when he challenged for the ball.",
      "\"There was no way VAR could get involved though because the incident didn’t lead immediately to the goal. It was never a free-kick mind you. Having worked Fernandes out referees have got to be as strong with Rashford now. He should’ve been booked for diving, not rewarded for his cheating.\"",
      "Rashford continues to be a regular despite an underwhelming season thus far. One man who's had quite the opposite fortunes is Scott McTominay, who continues to come up with big moments to secure much needed wins for United, as he did at Aston Villa.",
      "The midfielder's late header was another example of McTominay producing when it matter despite it looking as if he was surplus to requirements in the summer. The Scot was firmly on West Ham United's radar but they turned down a move with the Red Devils prospering as a result.",
      "Keys added: \"Isn’t it funny how life can work out? I’ll tell you this for a fact - if David Moyes had said ‘yes’ - McTominay would be at West Ham now.",
      "\"Moyes chased him all last summer, but couldn’t agree a fee with United. They wanted £40m for McTominay - Moyes offered £30m. Because he got frustrated, Moyes went shopping elsewhere - only for United to offer the player for £30m on deadline day. By then it was too late. Ten Hag must be a very happy man that once again fate has served him well.\"",

      "Dalot has been a mainstay for Erik ten Hag this season, making 32 appearances at right-back across all competitions. He has two goals and three assists in that time and earned plaudits for his pinpoint cross which Scott McTominay headed in to earn a 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "The 24-year-old joined United for £19million from Porto back in July 2018 and has now made 139 appearances for the club altogether. His future at the club previously appeared precarious after spending a season on loan with AC Milan in 2020/21, but he is now enjoying his most settled spell in the side.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand was one of those to question Dalot’s place in the United side, but he says Ronaldo convinced him he would come good. “Dalot needs a special mention,” Ferdinand said on Vibe with Five after the Villa win.",
      "“He is someone I doubted early on. I remember speaking to Cristiano Ronaldo and said, ‘Is he really that good?’ – and Cristiano said he will work hard, make himself better and 100 per cent improve.",
      "“He saw it behind the scenes so he knew that. I said to Darren Fletcher when I was at the training ground the other day that he has really impressed me. Darren said that he is a worker, he’s going to make himself the player he needs to be.",

      "Dalot also earned praise from Ten Hag for his performance against Villa. “Everyone gets criticism but he is a fantastic player who is developing very well,” the Dutchman said. “He can play in so many positions and he is improving on crosses. He can score and his defending is improving so I am very pleased with him.”",
      "Dalot has managed to nail down his position in the team at right-back and is now firmly ahead of Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the pecking order. Wan-Bissaka arrived from Crystal Palace for £50m in the summer of 2019, but could be let go in the summer transfer window when he will enter the final year of his contract.",

      "There was interest in McTominay's services back in the summer from West Ham, although a £30million proposal was rejected. It seemed, though, as if Erik ten Hag was more than happy to allow the United academy graduate to move on despite rebuffing said bid.",
      "But McTominay has been invaluable to the Dutchman since staying put, plundering seven goals in 21 Premier League appearances including a number of important late strikes. And his latest has even earned him some lofty praise from Diogo Dalot.",
      "“I think every time he comes on the pitch, he has that mentality of trying to score goals and trying to help the team,” the right-back said after Sunday's win, which keeps United in contention for a top-four finish.",

      "Ten Hag's comments post-match on Sunday, where he hailed McTominay as an example to his teammates, underlines that the midfielder has fully won him round. He said: \"There are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy and contribute to the team.",
      "\"Scott is an example for many other players, always giving the spirit and always doing the right things. He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready. It is great to have such a player.\"",

      "Manchester United have apologised to Norman Whiteside after dumping the club legend out of his seat at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside spent 11 years at Old Trafford, winning two FA Cups during his time with United. He is viewed as a legendary figure by many at the Red Devils, having become the youngest player to score in both the FA Cup final and League Cup final while with United.",
      "He is also the youngest player to score a senior goal for United and the youngest man to feature in the World Cup. Whiteside came through the academy at Old Trafford and became a hero for his home fans.",
      "The midfielder was forced to retire early due to injury and has held a platinum season ticket at United for more than 25 years. But the club relocated him for a recent game as they reconstruct hospitality areas at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside's wife Dee was left furious at the move. She wrote on Twitter : \"So, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve been a loyal supporter. Doesn’t matter if you played for your club, @ManUtd can just dump you from your seat when they feel like it, so they can expand exec seating! Absolute disgrace!",
      "\"I’d like to make clear that this post is not just about Norman. There are a whole block of loyal supporters who expressed their views to me at the West Ham game, but they feel as if they have no voice or platform to voice their anger.\"",
      "United have now responded to Whiteside's wife's claims, insisting they have the \"greatest respect\" for him. But they have insisted the reasons for the relocation are valid despite the anger of season ticket holders.",
      "A spokesperson said: “We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"These happen for various reasons, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders - in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "But Mrs Whiteside has been left unhappy despite that apology. She wrote: \"It's not just about Norman, many of the 'United family' we sit with have been in that block for 20-30+ years, and are all really angry about this ENFORCED seat relocation.",
      "\"At a time when the football has been less than spectacular and the season ticket price is increasing!\" Replying to another fan, she added: \"There are so many of us who have supported United together in that block who are angry as hell, and it looks like we count for nothing\".",

      "Manchester United have identified Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba as summer transfer targets - but their chances of doing a deal could be impacted by Liverpool's interest in Xabi Alonso.",
      "Despite failing to make a single signing during the January transfer window, Erik ten Hag is expected to be backed in the summer and a defensive overhaul is on his agenda.",
      "Not only are there question marks over the long-term futures of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane and Victor Lindelof - while Jonny Evans is set to leave when his contract expires - United are keeping tabs on Frimpong and Tapsoba with a view to firming up their interest at the end of the current campaign.",
      "As first reported by The Manchester Evening News the duo's impressive form at Leverkusen, who are top of the Bundesliga after going unbeaten so far this term and having thrashed Bayern Munich at the weekend, has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford.",
      "Interest in Frimpong initially emerged back in January with Ten Hag understood to be keen on signing a right-back ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Diogo Dalot has impressed in recent weeks but they're looking to strengthen with Wan-Bissaka likely to be sold as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "Strengthening at centre-back is also on United's agenda with Varane and Evans both due to become free agents in the summer. Lindelof could also yet be sold despite extending his deal for a further year and Tapsoba has been identified as a potential replacement.",
      "While it remains to be seen if acquiring both players would be financially viable - particularly as they look to also add in other areas - United's chances of doing a deal for the defensive duo are also likely to be complicated by Liverpool's interest in Alonso.",
      "The former Reds midfielder has been heavily touted as the ideal candidate to replace Anfield chief Jurgen Klopp, who announced last month that he would be standing down from his role at the end of the season.",
      "Alonso, 42, has earned plenty of plaudits for the impressive body of work he has achieved at Leverkusen who are now five points clear at the Bundesliga summit.",
      "And if Liverpool do decide that Alonso is the man to replace Klopp on Merseyside, then any potential transfer activity at Leverkusen would be delayed, with sporting director Simon Rolfes - who insists Alonso could stay put at the BayArena this summer - keen to let the club's head coach have their say on who stays and who goes.",

      "Darren Fletcher, the technical director, is consulted by assistant manager Mitchell van der Gaag on which players best suit the needs of the first team's session. Perhaps the only surprise from the club imagery on Monday is it did not feature left-backs Sam Murray or Harry Amass.",
      "Erik ten Hag was only able to maximise his strongest United XI for one full game against Wolves. Vladimir Coufal's needless tangle with Lisandro Martinez has deprived United of their totemic centre half for eight weeks and Luke Shaw flagged another injury issue at Villa Park on Sunday.",
      "Quirkily, United won seven games and lost five during the two months they were devoid of Martinez and Shaw. Shaw's initial eight-match return coincided with damaging defeats to Newcastle, Bournemouth, Bayern Munich and West Ham.",
      "The left-footers have only started five times together all season and United have lost once - at Tottenham. Martinez and Shaw's importance is accentuated by Ten Hag's preference for two right-footers and two left-footers in the back four.",
      "Only two Dutchmen have overstated that balance and both have managed United. Louis van Gaal was so insistent on a left-footed centre half he gave Tyler Blackett minutes, bought Marcos Rojo and played Daley Blind there for a season. Ten Hag pointlessly pitted right-footed centre halves Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire against each other earlier in the season.",
      "Varane and Maguire performed as a pair in their first league start under Ten Hag at Aston Villa. The game has evolved but a rightie and a leftie is not a tactical innovation. United did all right with Pallister and Bruce, Stam and Johnsen and Ferdinand and Vidic (all six were right-footed).",
      "Ten Hag admitted he had to make a compromise with Victor Lindelof's introduction at left-back. Lindelof looks as averse to the left as Jacob Rees-Mogg and the removal of Leon Bailey by Unai Emery was an inexplicable reprieve for the Swede.",
      "No matter how regularly United recruit a centre half, Lindelof gets reasonable playing time. Before he required groin surgery in December, he had started in 14 out of 19 United games. He made his 250th appearance for the club against West Ham and has appeared in at least 35 matches in all but one of his six seasons with United.",
      "Ten Hag has spoken about a core squad of \"15 or 16 players\" and Lindelof is among them. \"I hope we can keep them all fit and I think then we can still achieve a lot in this season,\" Ten Hag said earlier this month.",
      "Already, the flies are dropping again. Martinez against West Ham and Shaw against the other claret and blue outfit. Tyrell Malacia, another left-footer, has been sidelined for seven months and Aaron Wan-Bissaka's precautionary absence at Newport County is more serious after he withdrew from training on Thursday.",
      "Diogo Dalot is the only senior full-back available to Ten Hag. Dalot has missed only eight games through injury since the start of the 2020-21 season and he has had to fill in on the left eight times this term.",
      "The 15 or 16 players Ten Hag has alluded to excludes two of his most expensive signings. Antony ought to be the go-to game-changer off the bench but it is McTominay. The Scot has contributed more Premier League goals in six months than Antony has in 18 months. Mason Mount is becoming such an afterthought it is unclear if he will ever play in central midfield again for United amid Kobbie Mainoo's magisterial form.",
      "Sixteen players indicate 11 starters plus the maximum five substitutes Ten Hag can depend on. If we are to go off his strongest XI at Wolves, then the other five are Maguire, McTominay, Lindelof, Jonny Evans (all four came on against Wolves, West Ham and Villa) and possibly Christian Eriksen. Though Eriksen has not had a kick since he started in the draw with Tottenham a month ago.",
      "He has been a certain participant in the Monday sessions.",

      "Man Utd are set to return to the US this summer for their second pre-season tour in a row",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe isn't kidding when he says he wants Manchester United to be the best team in the world again. It is far easier said than done though.",
      "United not only have work to do on the pitch, but they also have to change their reputation off it, from a team synonymous with recent failure to one renowned for success.",
      "You only have to take a look at their provisional pre-season plans to see why regaining market control in North America is such an important part of their plans.",
      "United are planning to return to the United States for their pre-season tour this summer, with the suggestion they will face both Liverpool and Arsenal in friendly fixtures that are not part of a wider Premier League tournament.",
      "TAKEOVER: Ratcliffe one step away from completing investment",
      "It was not long ago that United were the most popular English side in the US. While the club might argue that they still are when using their own metrics, recent TV viewing figures tell the true story.",
      "United were ranked as the third 'most popular' football team in the States last year with Real Madrid fourth. Only the American national teams for men and women were higher. No other English clubs were in the top seven overall, yet there is clearly a shift in power.",
      "If you filter the votes by age demographic, United drop to fifth for Generation X, behind Real and Barcelona, and Millennials rank them as popular as Manchester City. They could soon be behind them.",
      "Then there are the viewing figures, a more reliable gauge than judging a 'fan' as someone who simply follows you on social media or is even just aware of your existence.",
      "The Premier League recently surpassed Liga MX as the most popular league in the United States, but United are not the most popular club to watch.",
      "Last year, United were only the 14th most watched side in the US, behind domestic rivals Tottenham, Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and City, and were just two places ahead of Everton.",
      "City's rise to second place was helped enormously by their prolonged on-field success and the fact that the Champions League final was watched by 3.4 million people in the US, a reminder of the underlying need for sporting improvement as well as commercial improvement.",
      "Success on the pitch is the best way to improve United's global popularity, though it is also the hardest to achieve given there is no guaranteed formula to produce it.",
      "Far easier is to increase your presence in local marketplaces. United will not only take a boots-on-the-ground approach with another pre-season tour but will do so boosted by their record front-of-shirt sponsor with Qualcomm.",
      "The US technology firm has agreed to a deal believed to be in the region of £60million per year to be one of United's main sponsors from next season, with the Snapdragon logo set to adorn the front of their kits.",
      "It will not only help the company's global exposure but will also benefit United to be partnered with such a successful US business, which counts Apple as one of their own customers.",
      "The tech firm 'presented' last year's trip stateside, and United even played in San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium against Wrexham. The plan is to play there again this summer.",
      "“We know that Manchester United and the Premier League in general are growing in popularity across the US,\" said John Murtough when confirming the 2023 tour.",
      "Every game was sold out during the last trip to America, though that is possibly an indication of the legacy fanbase they have cultivated and the opponents they faced rather than encouragement that they are still the team to watch.",
      "The fact United are heading back so soon tells you all you need to know about how important growth is in that market, particularly with the North American World Cup now just two years away.",
      "United want to conquer the world themselves.",

      "There is a decision to be made on whether to revamp or rebuild Manchester United's iconic home ground and the emotive topic is splitting fan opinion.",
      "It is impossible to replace 114 years of history and the place where immortals have been created, which means the ongoing conversation about Old Trafford is emotive.",
      "Manchester United fans are debating the same question: revamp or rebuild? There are advantages and downsides to both arguments and the final decision will not please everyone.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority stake in United has been approved by the Premier League and he will be able to speak openly about his plans once the deal is completed. Sources have said Ratcliffe will make radical changes and the future of Old Trafford is high on his agenda.",
      "Two years ago, United hired stadium masterplanners Populous to explore their options, but those plans were shelved when the Glazers placed the club on the market.",
      "Ratcliffe has picked up that baton and how far he runs with it remains to be seen, although he is Failsworth-born, he supports United and will understand the weight of the decision.",
      "The MEN reported last week United could rebuild Old Trafford without temporarily relocating and have been advised that is the best option, but some fans would prefer a new stadium.",
      "Old Trafford is not dilapidated as certain quarters of the media might suggest, but the roof has leaked for over 10 years and it's no longer a state-of-the-art venue. United are the biggest club in England and their stadium no longer represents that status, despite its prestige.",
      "The concourses need to be improved, the fan experience outside the ground bettered and the capacity must be increased, all of which could still be achieved in a redevelopment.",
      "It's understood a redevelopment would be more cost-effective than building a new stadium, but the expense would still be large and it would be a more time-consuming process.",
      "The main argument for a redevelopment isn't to save millions of pounds but to protect the club's history. Arsenal suffered when moving to the Emirates in 2006 and it's taken almost 20 years for that stadium to produce decent, consistent atmospheres and to feel like home.",
      "There have been generations of supporters to visit Old Trafford with their parents, grandparents, children and friends. The memories of watching the club's most successful period are within the ground's four corners and United wouldn't be United without The Theatre of Dreams.",
      "Sir Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo have graced the turf and that means something.",
      "Some fans are strongly against building a new stadium for those reasons. Others would argue rebuilding Old Trafford on the same site is the perfect compromise in a delicate decision.",
      "Tottenham's stadium is the best-in-class in the Premier League and that was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the club's feeling hasn't been lost.",
      "Spurs' ground cost around £1billion to build but their fans are delighted with their new home. The stadium is atmospheric and its facilities are world-leading.",
      "Furthermore, their stadium is the first purpose-built NFL venue outside of the US and Spurs have a deal to host a minimum of two games per year over 10 years, which is an extra revenue stream.",
      "The elephant in the room is Tottenham played home games at Wembley for almost two years while their stadium was being constructed and that wasn't an ideal arrangement.",
      "It's thought a new United stadium could be built, on the land behind the Stretford End, while Old Trafford is still in use and that would bring a higher return on investment.",
      "A redevelopment of Old Trafford would mean disruption and a temporary reduction in capacity, which some don't want, and it's a complicated decision from every angle.",
      "It will have an impact for a century and fans' voices must be considered in the process.",

      "Manchester United have officially welcomed Sir Jim Ratcliffe to Old Trafford this week after his acquisition of the Reds was ratified by the Premier League.",
      "United announced on Christmas Eve a deal had been reached with INEOS for them to join the boardroom. In the statement, the Reds added that Ratcliffe and his team would be acquiring a 25 per cent stake in the club and would be spearheading football operations with the Glazers taking a back seat.",
      "The subsequent January transfer window was quiet for United as Financial Fair Play (FFP) concerns lurked over the Reds. Due to this, Erik ten Hag did not make any additions to his squad this winter with the focus turning to the summer transfer window.",
      "It will be no surprise to Ratcliffe that United need reinforcements in their squad if they are to bridge the gap between themselves and the Premier League title challengers. MEN Sport understands Ten Hag is wishing to add a full-back, centre-back, midfielder and striker to his team at the very least.",
      "Ratcliffe is believed to be wanting to target players who are entering the final year of their contracts in the summer. Once a player is in the last 12 months, their price tag begins to diminish as their club attempts to either salvage a new deal or wishes to sell them before they leave for free.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a crack at trying to predict how the United line-up could look once the summer transfer window comes to an end in September.",
      "The United shot-stopper has endured a difficult first season at Old Trafford, but there seems to be no rush to replace him. It is clear the Cameroonian has the quality in his locker but this year has been a steep learning curve.",
      "The right-back has been on United's radar for some time and Xabi Alonso's potential exit from Bayer Leverkusen could accelerate his own departure from the Bundesliga. United's right side of defence requires the most strengthening and Frimpong fits the bill.",
      "United's rock-solid centre-back will be a miss while out injured but out of all the options currently at the club, he is the most likely to be holding down the defence next season.",
      "Nice's starring centre-back has been on United's radar pre-Ratcliffe. Whether the INEOS man would sanction a move for a player from one of his other clubs though remains to be seen.",

While the American family remaining at the club was not the outcome most supporters wanted, this is being deemed as the first step towards full control being relinquished.",
      "At this stage, INEOS are no strangers to acquiring football clubs into their wide-ranging sports portfolio. Swiss club FC Lausanne-Sport and French club Nice are also in the project run by Ratcliffe's group.",
      "However, it is his ownership of the Ligue 1 team which could come back to bite United as they pursue Champions League football. MEN Sport has rounded up what Ratcliffe's arrival means for the Reds in Europe.",
      "UEFA's rules state two clubs who are partially owned by the same person or organisation cannot compete in the same competition. Therefore, if United and Nice qualified for the Champions League, one of those teams would not be able to compete in Europe.",
      "The only scenario where two teams owned by the same group can both play in Europe is if one qualifies for the Champions League and the other makes it into the Europa Conference League. In this instance, neither side could face each other in UEFA competitions.",
      "Should United and Nice both finish in the Champions League qualification spots thanks to their league position, the club with the higher league finish would make it into Europe. If they qualified for different competitions, the one who reached the more prestigious tournament is allowed to advance.",
      "If they finished in the same position, it would come down to the coefficient rankings between the Premier League and Ligue 1. But if both clubs do qualify for Europe, UEFA will initially open proceedings against them through their Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) and that will give them a chance to prove they do comply with the rules.",
      "Before the start of this season, three cases of shared ownership were brought to UEFA involving; Aston Villa and Vitoria de Guimaraes, Brighton and Union Sant-Gilloise and AC Milan and Toulouse. In all instances, every team was allowed to compete in Europe.",
      "Explaining their ruling, UEFA claimed that 'following the implementation of significant changes by the clubs and their related investors,' teams were allowed to advance.",
      "Speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet, the current UEFA president hinted the multi-club ownership rules could be reviewed soon. Ceferin explained: \"We are not thinking about Manchester United only.",
      "\"We’ve had five or six owners of clubs who want to buy another club. We have to see what to do. The options are that it stays like that or that we allow them to play in the same competition. I’m not sure yet.",
      "\"We have to speak about these regulations and see what to do about it. There is more and more interest in this multi-club ownership. We shouldn’t just say no for the investments for multi-club ownership, but we have to see what kind of rules we set in that case, because the rules have to be strict.\"",
      "Explaining why the rules are currently in place, Ceferin added: \"From one point of view it’s true if you are the owner of two clubs and they play in the same competition you can say to one club to lose because you want the other to win. But for you, as a football player, do you think it’s so easy to do that, to tell a coach, lose the match because the other wants to win?\"",
      "It's the January transfer window once again, but despite United's indifferent start to the season, it remains to be seen whether they'll be able to bring any new players to Old Trafford this month. While the emphasis this January is on outgoings, with several players set to be sold or loaned out, there remains a possibility of a loan signing or two before February arrives.",

      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal are in a title race and seem guaranteed to occupy the top three positions, which leaves just one place for Champions League qualification up for grabs.",
      "That could change, as two leagues will be rewarded with an extra Champions League place for next season, but they are going to Italy and Germany as things stand.",
      "However, there's barely anything between Italy, Germany and England on the coefficient ranking system and Spain are not far behind, which means who gets the extra places will be decided by the performance of teams from each country in the knockout rounds of the competitions.",
      "For example, the further teams from England progress in the Conference League, Europa League and the Champions League, the more likely an extra place in the Premier League will be.",
      "Regardless, the priority for United during the remainder of the season is to finish in the top four and already crashing out of European competition should give them an advantage.",
      "United have rarely been knocked out of Europe before Christmas and, after exiting from the Carabao Cup in the early rounds, the fixture list looks kind in the next few months.",
      "Two games per week is normal for United, who intend to compete in four competitions, but the majority of the midweeks are fixture-free from now until the end of the campaign.",
      "At the moment, there are just two weeks in the next three months when United play twice, although that could change if they progress into the latter rounds of the FA Cup.",
      "Even if they do, most of the weeks will remain without a midweek fixture and that should be a huge benefit as the team recovers, prepares and trains at Carrington for the next match.",
      "The load on the players will be easier to manage and fewer injuries should occur. United have close to a fully fit squad and should be able to operate with their best players starting games.",
      "Luke Shaw was substituted as a precaution on Sunday and is being assessed. He is expected to be fit for Luton Town, but if a midweek fixture was in the schedule, he would likely be absent.",
      "There are also obvious tactical benefits to not having a midweek fixture because Ten Hag has more time on the training ground to convey his message, work with the players and prepare.",
      "After failing to qualify for Europe last season, Tottenham are in the same boat, but Aston Villa are still in the Conference League and that's an opportunity for 'meaningful' silverware.",
      "Unai Emery's focus is not just on the league and he'll have a busier schedule to contend with, whereas United can 'treat every game like a cup final', as Ten Hag keeps reiterating.",
      "United must compete in the Champions League each season and there are consequences when they don't. There is still enough football to be played to qualify.",

      "United would also be hit by reduced capacity crowds, as they were when the north stand, now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, was rebuilt in 1995.",

      "European vs Brit. Attack vs defence. Mourinho vs Solskjaer. But it is Erik ten Hag who has settled on an outcome to Man United's right-back duel.",
      "Diogo Dalot has picked his moments for assists this season. The first teed up Alejandro Garnacho for the goal of the season and the second invited Scott McTominay to resume his matchwinner mode.",
      "Dalot's centre for McTominay was billed as a \"David Beckham cross\" by Paul Merson in the Villa Park studio. Dalot has tallied a modest nine assists for United and Sunday's was his finest.",
      "\"I think I have the ability to do it,\" Dalot said in the mixed zone. \"I still think I can get even more, so hopefully in the future.\"",
      "The United website queried whether Dalot is in the form of his life. He isn't. That was in his first months under Erik ten Hag when he started all but one match (missed through suspension) and sustained that momentum at the World Cup. Dalot ousted Joao Cancelo from the Portugal team in Qatar.",
      "Dalot's whipped cross against Aston Villa possibly closes the chapter on the five-year right-back battle at Manchester United. Dalot is nearing the performance level of the first third of last season whereas Aaron Wan-Bissaka has gone missing again.",
      "When Dalot was firmly cemented at right-back last term, Wan-Bissaka was absent for 10 successive Premier League matches. Now he has a problem with his leg.",
      "He is unlikely to be given a leg up. Wan-Bissaka, who withdrew from United's training session on Thursday, is out of contract next year. Dalot signed a new contract last year. Wan-Bissaka is sidelined and Dalot is starting.",
      "United have room for improvement at right-back and Wan-Bissaka is the obvious makeweight. United were prepared to sell him in Ten Hag's first summer.",
      "Jose Mourinho bought Dalot for £19million in 2018 and a year later United agreed a £50m fee with Crystal Palace for Wan-Bissaka. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer peculiarly favoured British recruits, a strategy that was abandoned as early as his second transfer window.",
      "Wan-Bissaka played 46 times for Palace before he became an automatic pick at United, where he drew acclaim for his sliding tackles and, in particular, his one-sided duels with the Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling.",
      "Dalot had such an injury-ravaged season in 2019-20 he played only 11 times but the nadir came when he was fit. With left-backs Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams both injured, Dalot was expected to start away to Palace on account of his versatility. Instead, Solskjaer resurrected Timothy Fosu-Mensah for his first United appearance in over three years. Dalot only got a look-in when Solskjaer picked a heavily-rotated team to face Norwich in the FA Cup quarter-final.",
      "With Wan-Bissaka a certain starter, Dalot secured a season-long loan to AC Milan in October 2020. Wan-Bissaka started in all 15 of United's Champions League and Europa League games and in 34 of their 38 Premier League matches (Solskjaer rested regulars for two of those games to prioritise the Europa League) that season.",
      "Yet Wan-Bissaka had not improved on an impressive first season. Teams started to target his doziness at the far post and two goals and six assists were flattering numbers. United also proved to be one of the most misleading teams in the fake football era of crowdless stadia.",
      "In summer 2021, United wanted Kieran Trippier and Bury-born Trippier wanted United, but Atletico Madrid priced him out of a homecoming. Dalot had spent a steady and, crucially, injury-free season at Milan that ended with an 11th-hour call-up to the Portugal squad for the European Championship. Dalot made his debut against France in the group stage and started in the round-of-16 defeat to Belgium.",
      "With Dalot's stock rising, United fielded enquiries. Milan were interested in re-signing him while Borussia Dortmund touched base. Any move was blocked when United failed to make headway with Trippier.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was still Solskjaer's man. Dalot's only starts under the Norwegian in 2021-22 were in the League Cup third round defeat to West Ham and the fortuitous Champions League group stage win against Villarreal when he was run ragged by Arnaut Danjuma.",
      "Solskjaer quipped to a United staff member afterwards, \"It's a shame Diogo can't f-----g defend.\" Dalot creditably fronted up for a virtual mixed zone chat.",
      "With United still keeping tabs on Trippier on the assumption his valuation would decrease in the 2022 January window, Roma - now coached by Mourinho - expressed interest in Dalot.",
      "Only United had started to spiral, shipping four goals at Leicester, five to Liverpool and another four at Watford within five weeks. Solskjaer apologetically raised his hand to the away end at Vicarage Road. It also signalled his goodbye and he filmed a tearful exit interview the next day.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was in the midst of a personal downward spiral but caretaker manager Michael Carrick favoured continuity in the back four. The turning point came in Carrick's second match in the manager's seat when Wan-Bissaka suffered a hand injury in the draw at Chelsea.",
      "Dalot was recalled against Arsenal four days later for what was his first Premier League start in 788 days. United won with interim manager Ralf Rangnick watching in the stands.",
      "For the first time, Dalot was the favoured pick at right-back over Wan-Bissaka, who started in only one of Rangnick's first 13 matches in the dugout. Dalot started in 22 of United's 29 games under Rangnick, who favoured more intense and front-footed characters.",
      "For Dalot, the season was progressive in that his playing time had soared. He played in 30 games having appeared in 34 in his previous full seasons with United. He was also a fixture in the Portugal squad. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive Englishman who has never played for England.",
      "United received more enquiries about Dalot but informed interested parties the right-back they wanted to cash in on was Wan-Bissaka in the summer of 2022. Ten Hag replaced Rangnick and brought with him Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, instrumental to the Latino rebranding of the United defence. Dalot tallied with the grinta - grit or determination - of Martinez, Casemiro and one-time Madridista Raphael Varane.",
      "Such was United's weak position in the transfer market there were no takers for Wan-Bissaka. With the summer transfer window open for only a few more days, United briefed Wan-Bissaka would be staying.",
      "Wan-Bissaka had four minutes of playing time under Ten Hag before the World Cup interrupted the club calendar in November. Dalot sustained a hamstring injury in Portugal's quarter-final defeat to Morocco and Wan-Bissaka marked his return for United with a rare assist against Burnley in the League Cup fourth round.",
      "For the next six months, Wan-Bissaka had the momentum. Dalot suffered a recurrence of his hamstring strain in the League Cup quarter-final against Charlton Athletic and he was hooked at half-time in the League Cup final after Allan Saint-Maximin rode roughshod over him. Wan-Bissaka came on and Saint-Maximin hit a force field.",
      "Wan-Bissaka performed creditably in the second half of last season and he was United's only acceptable performer when they went down with a fight to Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Dalot was an unused substitute and began this season on the bench.",
      "During pre-season in the United States, Ten Hag had still not settled on his right-back for the season opener against Wolves. Wan-Bissaka lined up in the first two matches against Arsenal and Real Madrid but Dalot returned with a goal against Dortmund in Las Vegas.",
      "United returned home and back at Old Trafford, Dalot's careless pass inadvertently assisted Florian Sotoca's audacious lob over Andre Onana. The next day, Wan-Bissaka contributed to a last-minute equaliser for Facundo Pellistri in Dublin.",
      "Wan-Bissaka started this season as he ended last season - as United's best player. That was all too brief as he succumbed to a hamstring injury against Brighton in September.",
      "Dalot has been injury-free all season. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, he has extraordinarily missed only eight out of a possible 192 games through injury.",
      "Both full-backs have started in the same XI nine times this season amid Tyrell Malacia's interminable absence with a knee problem and Luke Shaw's brittleness. Each has shown admirable resilience at stages of their United career. Wan-Bissaka has overcome homesickness and plans to jettison him.",
      "But Dalot has always had the edge under Ten Hag. 74 of his 139 appearances for United have come under the Dutchman whereas Wan-Bissaka has played 51 times for the incumbent United manager.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has always been the more secure defender and Dalot the more accomplished attacker. Wilfried Zaha has tormented Dalot for Palace and Galatasaray yet was denied a one-on-one with David de Gea by Wan-Bissaka last season.",
      "\"I had a little look back and I thought, 'Oh my God, it's Aaron,'\" Zaha lamented. \"He's the only one who can do the scoop tackle.\" James Maddison was so in awe of Wan-Bissaka's marshalling of Brighton livewire Kaoru Mitoma during last season's FA Cup semi-final he tweeted, \"AWB is ridiculously good at 1 v 1 defending. Probably the best in the world bar none. So many wingers run out of ideas when playing directly against him.\"",
      "Yet right-backs are judged on their attacking output and Wan-Bissaka is as shy at attacking as he is at speaking. Wan-Bissaka had to \"pick up on the coaching\", in Ten Hag's words last January.",
      "Dalot executed a couple of sliding interventions reminiscent of Wan-Bissaka in the first half at Villa Park on Sunday. He then bent it like Beckham in the second half.",

      "Goalkeepers could face a stint in the sin bin and won't be able to be directly replaced until their time out is over, according to new rules being considered by football's rule-makers.",
      "The PA news agency understands that these rules would apply to all players on the pitch, including goalkeepers, but not to substitutes or team officials. The International Football Association Board (IFAB) has been working on these trial protocols, which are designed to improve player behaviour. However, the publication of these rules, which were due to be released on Friday, has been delayed indefinitely.",
      "If a goalkeeper is sent to the sin bin, their team will have to decide whether to bring on a substitute goalkeeper by taking off an outfield player for 10 minutes, or manage with an outfield player in goal during the temporary dismissal. If implemented at the top level, it would give the likes of Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag something to think about should his goalkeeper fall on the wrong side of the referee.",
      "If they chose the first option, they would then have to decide which goalkeeper to remove once the original one could return to the pitch, assuming they had enough substitutions left. The IFAB protocols' publication was delayed after several media reports on Thursday about the introduction of blue cards as part of sin bin trials.",
      "It's been said that a backlash against the idea contributed to the delay, but the IFAB hasn't given an official reason for the delay. PA understands that the trials were never meant to be introduced into top-level professional football during the initial trial phase, meaning the rules won't be followed at Old Trafford any time soon.",
      "FIFA's referees' chief Pierluigi Collina stated in November, after approval was given at IFAB's annual business meeting for trial protocols to be drawn up, that the trials would \"very probably\" involve professional football.",
      "\"The trial was very successful in a grassroots competition. Now we are talking of a higher level, very probably professional or even high professional football,\" the Italian said. \"We need to draft something that works or is worthy for top football.\"",
      "At that time, there were reportedly initial expressions of interest in the sin bin trials from some of Europe's top leagues. The Football Association was also understood last week to be considering a trial in the men's or women's FA Cup at some point in the future.",
      "FIFA said in a statement: \"FIFA wishes to clarify that reports of the so-called 'blue card' at elite levels of football are incorrect and premature.\"",
      "They added: \"Any such trials, if implemented, should be limited to testing in a responsible manner at lower levels, a position that FIFA intends to reiterate when this agenda item is discussed at the IFAB AGM on March 2.\"",

His introduction - and subsequent impact - might have come even sooner had it not been for him suffering an injury setback last summer.",

      "“I looked for Pellistri because he knew what he could give us. He meets all the conditions on the wing, he had his personal ambition for growth and that leaves me happy.",
      "\"With Barcelona, he made a lot of effort in defense to execute the pressure, he had a goal, an assist. He is consolidated in Europe and it is up to us to guide him, so this is a positive loan.\"",
      "Pellistri last started for United in September and his first-team opportunities were limited, with Erik ten Hag preferring Antony and Alejandro Garnacho on the right.",
      "The youngster is a regular starter for Uruguay on the international stage but has failed to nail down a starting place at United.",
      "United signed Pellistri from Penarol in a £9million deal on deadline day in October 2020 and he has played 24 times for the club.",

      "Manchester United youngster Kobbie Mainoo can do no wrong at the moment and his role in the winning goal against Aston Villa on Sunday has gone under the radar.",
      "Scott McTominay's name dominated headlines and Diogo Dalot won praise for his perfectly weighted cross, which he struck first time, into the box, but the goal wouldn't have happened without Mainoo retaining possession against the odds just seconds earlier.",
      "Casemiro played a speculative pass forward and Mainoo held his run, only to find himself in between Douglas Luiz and Jacob Ramsey, and what he did next was superb.",
      "Mainoo's first touch brought him toward the goal and, in that scenario, most players would attempt to attack the byline and play a cross into the box themselves.",
      "Douglas Luiz is one of the Premier League's best midfielders. His preference was to tempt Mainoo into taking the ball around him and at worst, he could have sent it for a corner.",
      "Mainoo was unlikely to succeed due to Douglas Luiz's positioning and Ramsey was closing in behind him, which meant the Aston Villa pair seemed to have the danger covered.",
      "The youngster was aware he'd struggle to beat Douglas Luiz and immediately took a second touch to turn back inside where he knew one of his teammates would be waiting.",
      "His third touch was to execute the turn and Ramsey charged him down. The ball might have taken a slight deflection - the replays are inconclusive - but it found its way to Dalot.",
      "What happened next won the game for United, as Dalot played a cross that David Beckham would have been proud of and McTominay fired his header into the back of the net.",
      "Dalot and McTominay have won the plaudits but Mainoo deserves to be lauded. His role in the goal was just as important and his ability to be press resistant created space for Dalot.",
      "The 18-year-old is so laid-back he is almost horizontal and that demeanour is seen on the pitch because he's remarkably composed for a player who has fewer than 20 senior appearances.",
      "With just minutes remaining in a crucial game, many players in the scenario Mainoo found himself in would panic, but he stayed calm, attracted the Villa press and found his teammate.",
      "Mainoo has demonstrated maturity beyond his years since breaking into the first team this season and that moment against Villa, which was instinctive, is just the latest example of that.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund recently described Mainoo as a 'generational talent' and revealed the dressing room were adamant about his potential following a breakout pre-season last summer.",
      "For those who follow the club's academy, Mainoo has not been a secret but his transition to senior football has been genuinely impressive. He is the same player in the Premier League as he was for the Under-21s, despite that level being a significant step up.",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",

Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fletcher have appeared in the FA Youth Cup and Uefa Youth League for Man United already this season and are only still 16.",
      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United are looking ahead to their first summer transfer window under INEOS after Sir Jim Ratcliffe's deal was ratified by the Premier League",
      "Manchester United are entering their first summer transfer window not run by the Glazers in more than a decade at the end of the season.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's move to Old Trafford has been ratified by the Premier League meaning the INEOS founder is now fully operating the football side of the club. While not an immediate concern at this stage, Ratcliffe will have a firm eye on the upcoming summer transfer window at the end of the season.",
      "United will be in desperate need of new recruits come the end of the season with the core of the squad needing to be improved before a ball is kicked in anger in August. But how will INEOS approach their first summer transfer window, based on their actions at two other clubs under their influence, OGC Nice and FC Lausanne-Sport?",
      "MEN Sport has spoken to Lausanne supporter and Les Pontheses blogger Vedouble and Editor-in-Chief of Get French Football News Luke Entwistle to gain insight on what we can expect from Ratcliffe and co at United.",
      "One notable characteristic from INEOS' first forays at both clubs was their eagerness to spend relatively big with disappointing results. \"In the first few months (winter 2018), a lot of money was spent on players who didn't make the impact that had been hoped for, and the club was relegated to the second division,\" Vedouble explained.",
      "\"Then, after the first relegation, INEOS said it had learned from its mistakes and made reasonable transfers financially speaking, which enabled the club to climb back into the top flight after two seasons in the second division.\"",
      "\"At the start, it was big money, it was all about spending big, bringing in profiles who had been looking very promising elsewhere,\" Entwistle concurred when discussing Nice. \"If you look at the first window, it was a very strange one at Nice because INEOS and Ratcliffe came in not only mid-window but towards the end of the summer window.",
      "\"I am sure they were looking at profiles before because they knew this deal was going to go through but you essentially had a mad dash to bring in profiles they wanted. How intensely they had been scouted, you can perhaps ask a few questions there but they did spend big and they spent big on young profiles at the time.",
      "\"What we saw was an investment in young talents, talents who had proven they could make the step but in that first window, they fell flat.\"",
      "While Nice have managed to restabilise themselves this season with signings focused on being no older than 25, for the most part, and are pushing hard for Champions League qualification, the story at INEOS' Swiss club has been a lot more deflating.",
      "\"Following the takeover, the sporting side of Lausanne-Sport was led by Nice through Julien Fournier,\" Vedouble continued. \"Lausanne's sporting director Pablo Iglesias was sacked overnight and immediately replaced by Souleymane Cisse in June 2020, directly after the club's rise to the Super League (Swiss top division).",
      "\"After that, everything that was working was thrown away and many players were recruited as well as an inexperienced coach. So we had to start from scratch or almost from scratch, to rebuild everything.",
      "\"Among these new players, some arrived from Racing Club d'Abidjan (based in Cote d'Ivoire), founded by Souleymane Cisse himself! They did not have the level (required to play for the club)",
      "\"These players were recruited by Nice and then loaned to Lausanne. In the beginning, we all saw this as a good thing because the bridges between Nice and Lausanne could be beneficial, but then we quickly realised that this was not going to help our club because there was no vision established.",
      "\"Many clubs do it and it is by far not a problem, but only if there is a real project, if the realities of Swiss football are taken into account and if the change of approach is applied step by step. By entrusting the management of this project to the Cisse-Fournier duo, INEOS got it all wrong and I don't even know if they were aware of the disaster that was unfolding.\"",
      "While the links between Lausanne and Nice have been established, the talk in France is of Nice avoiding this same fate with the Reds. One name who has been heavily linked with United since before the Ratcliffe takeover is centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo and Entwistle believes this is a deal which could be completed in the summer but will not be the start of a feeder club relationship between the two teams.",
      "\"I think it could become highly political and I think like any good politician he [Ratcliffe] should be and likely will be, thinking of his image and how this will make him look at OGC Nice which is still a huge investment, a huge part of his portfolio in a part of the world in which he lives and where he is highly invested,\" Entwistle added.",
      "\"Notions of Manchester United coming in and raiding Nice for all of their top talents I don’t think is something that is going to happen in the summer. All the talk here is that Nice will not become an affiliate club of Manchester United.",
      "\"There will be natural, logical links that will be formed. Todibo is a player who has been linked and predates the ownership situation and I am sure he will still be a target, why wouldn’t he be? He continues to perform excellently and will be available for less money in the summer than he was in January.",
      "\"I think Ratcliffe will be wary of how it will look if United came in and pillaged Nice for all of their talent and then they have a significant drop-off. I see Todibo as a player who could certainly move to Manchester United because he simply makes that defence better and he is someone who has previously been identified as someone who could improve that defence.\"",
      "While it is very much business as usual for Nice, Vedouble is understandably cautious about what is to come for his club, who sit second bottom in the Swiss Super League, in the summer transfer window and beyond as INEOS' relationship is still not fully healed. They concluded: \"At present, and since the departure of Souleymane Cisse, Lausanne-Sport still do not have a sporting director but benefit from the support of Nice for the recruitment of certain players.",
      "\"The problem lies in the fact that INEOS does not communicate the vision and the real project in place in Lausanne.\" \"I have mixed feelings about this (United venture),\" Vedouble continued, \"because, on the one hand, it could be positive for our club.",
      "\"More visibility (for our club), building our reputation, which could make it easier to sign certain players but on the other hand it could be negative because Lausanne-Sport could be left behind.",
      "\"We can already see that INEOS seems to be more invested in Nice financially speaking and that in Lausanne there is a lot of tinkering going on, and I fear that the arrival of Manchester United will make the situation even more uncertain.\"",

      "\"The next six games are fairly winnable, obviously one of them's Man City, who knows but I think we're going to qualify for the Champions League.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Bent disagreed, and said: \"There's enough points to play for but the way Spurs have been consistent this season, they're the team that will finish in fourth place. I can't see them jumping Tottenham. Aston Villa are having a bit of a wobble and they have Europa Conference League commitment so that may distract them, they're not in great form.",
      "\"But I can't see Manchester United finishing above both of them, maybe one of them - Aston Villa potentially, the longer the season goes on. Spurs, under Ange Postecoglou, have been so consistent, even when they had the injuries, they played the same way, they've got big results. Even at the weekend when they we thought they were dead and buried, they came back and got the result. I can't see them finishing above Spurs.",
      "Lewis added: \"I just don't trust Man United. They've had so many full storms, this is the first time this season they've put four consecutive wins in all competitions together. They just can't do it, they haven't done it all season. Why now? What would make me think why now, admittedly a good win at Aston Villa, a win in which Villa had their fair share of chances. Their next game against Luton at Kenilworth Road, I don't even back them to win that.\"",

Dalot, who has been a key player for Erik ten Hag this season, has made 32 appearances and scored two goals. He also assisted Scott McTominay's winning goal against Aston Villa last weekend.",
      "Dalot joined United from Porto in July 2018 for £19million and has since played 139 times for the club. Despite spending a season on loan with AC Milan, he is now enjoying a stable period at United.",
      "Ferdinand admitted that he had questioned Dalot's place in the team, but Ronaldo had reassured him. \"He is someone I doubted early on.

      "Spanish giants Real Madrid have been linked with a shock move for Rasmus Hojlund - but Man United should not be too concerned about their £72million striker leaving.",
      "Manchester United would have every right to feel a little smug about Rasmus Hojlund right now. But the Premier League giants should not be too worried about the mighty Real Madrid swooping in for his signature.",
      "Erik ten Hag and key figures responsible for transfers at Old Trafford raised more than one or two eyebrows when snapping-up Hojlund from Atalanta last summer. They haven't always got things right in that department since the former Ajax manager touched down - yet in the Denmark prospect they might have cracked it - so much so that the 21-year-old is reportedly already drawing interest from the Santiago Bernabeu, according to Spanish outlet Defensa Central.",
      "United knew what they had with Hojlund. However, the hefty price tag made him an easy target for rival fans and was repeatedly thrown at him as he went 15 matches without opening his Premier League account.",
      "It's now five in five for Hojlund as competitors - domestically and in Europe - finally start to take notice.",
      "\"Manchester United have not had a striker they can hit,\" said ex-United man Gary Neville after Hojlund's belated Premier League debut against Arsenal in September. \"[Cristiano] Ronaldo was not a classic target-man, [Anthony] Martial and [Marcus] Rashford certainly aren't,\" continued Neville. \"But it looks as though Hojlund will mess people about and the good thing is that he's still learning the game.\"",
      "Hojlund continues to learn his and United's game at a staggering rate. His early struggles were well-documented, but there were mitigating circumstances such as the player needing sufficient time to settle on and off the field, United being unable to find their rhythm collectively and him adjusting to the additional interest and pressure.",
      "\"He's only played a couple of seasons at top-level football,\" added Neville. \"But people are expecting him to be an Erling Haaland for Manchester United. They don't have anyone with experience to help or back him up.",
      "\"We have been watching him [Martial] for eight or nine years now, he's not what Ten Hag needs or wants. This lad [Hojlund] with a big price tag on him, it was an encouraging start.\"",
      "Fourteen games later, Hojlund - who did underline his promise with five goals in six outings across the Champions League group stages - finally got up and running in the Premier League and has not stopped scoring since. His tally now reads 11 goals from 29 games in all competitions to justify his pricetag.",
      "Mooted interest from Real is a bittersweet feeling for United. On one hand, it re-emphasises their decision to sign him as a replacement for Ronaldo - after Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen were both considered behind-the-scenes - and their rough diamond is becoming shinier with each and every game.",
      "Alternatively, there might be some concern as Real - by hook or by crook - usually get their way when it comes to the transfer market. Spearheaded by Jude Bellingham, they have operated without an out-an-out No.9 this term as the Spanish giants prepare to make yet another marquee addition next summer.",
      "Kylian Mbappe is the obvious and ongoing fit. The on-and-off pursuit for his signature might finally be drawing to a conclusion, while Manchester City have fixed at least one eye on the Spanish capital from the moment they signed Erling Hojlund from Borussia Dortmund last summer.",
      "Mbappe and Haaland are the real deal. Hojlund, by contrast, is still a work in progress and that should be enough to convince lingering doubters United will be able to continue enjoying that journey for a while yet.",

      "It exploited a worrying weakness in the United backline and a troublesome trend that has been apparent all season. United concede a lot of corners; it is no surprise they concede from them either.",
      "United have conceded the joint-highest expected goals from corners in the Premier League this campaign, with the stats suggesting they have given away enough chances to typically expect nine goals against them. Erik ten Hag's side have actually only conceded six goals from those, though it could quite easily have been more if not for sharp stops from Onana to deny the likes of Ollie Watkins and Tomáš Souček in the last two matches.",
      "United's specific defensive record from corners is by no means the worst in the division, with Arsenal, Brighton, and Aston Villa conceding more frequently from them, but the underlying issue is that they have faced a whole lot more.",
      "United have had a staggering 157 against them already this season, while Arsenal have had just 66 against them. It means United have only actually conceded to 3.82% of them, and Arsenal have conceded to 7.57% of the ones they have faced.",
      "The solution is not necessarily to be better at defending set pieces, though it would obviously help, but to limit the number of them in the first place.",
      "A key reason United have conceded so many is because they have changed their backline so often, with Ten Hag rarely being able to field what he would consider his strongest back-four, while the side has also suffered from Casemiro's absence and drop in form for much of the campaign.",
      "It is a valid excuse, though it is also a little too convenient as well. The bottom line is that United's defensive discipline hasn't been good enough for much of the campaign, regardless of personnel.",
      "Yet rather than be a message of doom and gloom, it should serve as one of encouragement. Ten Hag's side aren't as bad at defending corners as it first seems, and if they can cut down the volume, then they should see a clear improvement.",

Both players featured in Saturday's 3-0 thumping of title rivals Bayern Munich, with Frimpong coming off the bench to score and Tapsoba keeping Harry Kane quiet.",

      "Despite Diogo Dalot performing at his highest level since joining Porto in 2018, Ten Hag is said to be keen on bringing the Dutch international, valued at £68million, to add more threat down the right. Frimpong has contributed to 13 goals in 20 league games this season, making him one of Leverkusen's most dangerous players.",
      "Tapsoba, who moved to Leverkusen in 2020, can play either left or right centre-back and offers height, good passing range and an aerial threat. However, with a contract at the BayArena until 2028, it's expected that Leverkusen will demand close to his €50million (£42.5m) valuation from CIES Football Observatory.",
      "One contributing factor to Man United signing both players could be Jurgen Klopp's exit from Liverpool. The German is leaving the club at the end of the season and Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso the frontrunner to replace him.",
      "Alonso's possible exit could see Leverkusen lose some of their biggest players. Playmaker Florian Wirtz is another player who could be sold, with Bayern Munich keen.",

      "Ghana FA board member Randy Abbey told The Times last week: \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents, and the association would love to work with him and many like him at home and abroad.\"",
      "But according to the Daily Mail, Mainoo is expected to keep his options open until he is confident of securing a place in the England squad, which is not likely until the autumn at the earliest. Other than the European Championships, the Three Lions do not have any other competitive matches until September.",
      "Despite this, the FA are confident of securing Mainoo's services. As per FIFA rules, a player can switch their allegiances at any time if they have only played friendlies, while those under the age of 21 are able to move after three years if they have only played less than three competitive games.",
      "England face a double-header at Wembley against Brazil and Belgium in two international friendlies in March as they ramp up their preparations for Euro 2024. This is before Southgate's side takes on Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland in their final two matches before the tournament starts in June.",
      "Although Mainoo may not get his senior chance yet, Southgate, according to the report, is set to recommend that the midfielder be promoted into Lee Carsley's under-21s squad moving forward. The young Lions are next in action when they face Azerbaijan and Luxembourg in two U21 Euro qualifiers next month.",
      "Mainoo has become an important member of the United side in recent weeks, partnering Casemiro in a double pivot. This has allowed Bruno Fernandes to venture further forward, with Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford providing support for Rasmus Hojlund up front.",

      "Ivory Coast striker Sebastien Haller scored the winner in the AFCON final against Nigeria just hours after Erik ten Hag had guided Manchester United to a win over Aston Villa in the Premier League",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has revealed that he reached out to Sebastien Haller, his former player, to congratulate him on his winning goal for Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Ten Hag, who worked with Haller early in his career at Utrecht and later signed him for Ajax, has been a strong support for the player during his fight against testicular cancer.",
      "After Haller scored the decisive goal for Ivory Coast in their 2-1 win over Nigeria, Ten Hag, who had just led United to a crucial Premier League victory at Aston Villa, was watching on TV. He admitted it was a touching moment.",
      "\"I had direct contact with Seb on Sunday night after the final,\" he said. \"There has also been frequent contact during his period of illness. I tried to support him as much as possible. Of course, he had only been away from Ajax for a fortnight when the illness was diagnosed. For me too, that was a huge blow.\"",
      "He continued: \"A sportsman in the prime of his life with a young family of three children and then such an illness. The way he dealt with it deserves great respect. He did not flee in anger but accepted it immediately and took everything he could to improve his chances of recovery and be resilient.",
      "\"He has fought his way back tremendously and then it is great that this is now followed by such a well-deserved sporting highlight.\" Haller was told he had cancer in July 2022, just weeks after joining Borussia Dortmund from Ajax.",
      "He moved to the Amsterdam club in January 2021 after an 18-month spell with West Ham following a £45million move from Eintracht Frankfurt. But the striker has never forgotten the role Ten Hag has played in his career and the pair kept in touch when the striker was undergoing extensive chemotherapy treatment to beat his disease.",
      "He returned to action with Borussia Dortmund last season - only to miss a crucial penalty in a 2-2 draw with Mainz on the final day of the season which cost his club the Bundesliga title. Ten Hag said: \"This highlight is so much to Seb's credit after everything he has been through. His story is of course super emotional. From a sporting point of view, it was difficult for him. Last year he missed the title with Borussia Dortmund and missed a penalty in the decisive match.\"",
      "\"That he then is now an African champion is great. Seb is a fantastic personality, a real team player. That attitude doesn't suit a striker, but that's how he always sets himself up. He is modest and humble, just a great player to have in your squad.\"",
      "\"And he radiates calmness and tranquillity. You can see that in his game. He is imperturbable and therefore able to score such a decisive goal at such an important moment in difficult circumstances.\"",

      "As the future of Man Utd's Old Trafford stadium remains unclear, we asked fans what they think should happen next",
      "With the arrival of investment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group, the question of Manchester United's home has been brought to the fore once again in recent weeks. Old Trafford is starting to creak, following a lack of investment under the Glazers' ownership, neglect that is made to look worse as their main rivals either improve their own venues or even build completely new ones.",
      "Ratcliffe's arrival - subject to regulatory approval from the Premier League - will bring a much-needed influx of cash. And an additional £237m of funding has already been specifically earmarked for Old Trafford.",
      "But the big question is, what will that money and the additional hundreds of millions required be spent on? Renovations of the grand old stadium, an extension of the existing structure, or a completely new stadium built next to the current one or elsewhere?",
      "It's an issue that provokes strong feelings - some fans have forged keen ties over the years with the existing stadium and its history and would not want to move away from that, while others feel that the club needs to move with the times in order to keep up with rivals, even if that means moving a completely new home. We asked the question to United fans via a poll here on the MEN website, and they've offered a clear preference:",
      "1,553 responses",
      "The majority of respondents to our poll - 61 per cent - said that their preference would be to knock down the existing stadium and build a new one - either on land next door or elsewhere nearby. This would, of course, be the most expensive option, potentially totalling £2bn.",
      "The next most popular move at 35pc would be to expand and fully renovate the existing stadium to stay on the same footprint. This is less expensive, but logistically difficult due to the train line running behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand - the obvious contender for replacement by a larger structure.",
      "The two remaining options in the survey, a small renovation of the stadium or to leave it as it is, were highly unpopular gaining just 2pc of the vote each.",
      "This is, of course, only a snapshot of opinion among the fans, with the final decision in the hands of the Glazers and the new investors. But what is clear that as Old Trafford creaks and crumbles, a solution will need to come soon.",

Ratcliffe’s investment is not seen as exciting as the ultimately-withdrawn proposal initially put forward by Al-Thani, with traders acting accordingly.",

      "Andre Onana earned plenty of praise for his performance in United's weekend win over Aston Villa, but at the same time, he also drew some criticism for his divisive style of play.",
      "How you rate Onana depends on what you judge a goalkeeper's job to be. If it was just to keep the ball out of the back of the net, then he did that with eight saves in total on Sunday afternoon, five of which were inside the box.",
      "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HOPES: United handed huge injury update that could swing Premier League top four race",
      "But if that is the trait that reigns supreme, then is he really an upgrade on David de Gea? Onana was signed to be an improvement on the Spaniard shot-stopper, yet all he has really done is emulate him in his debut campaign.",
      "Onana catches the eye for his reactionary stops, no matter how unorthodox they might be, yet he has been exposed all season for limited distribution and an uncertainty brought to the entire defensive line.",
      "The quirk is that the Cameroonian still sits second in the race for the Golden Glove award in the Premier League, though you only have to watch how United play to realise he is not the second-best goalkeeper in the league.",
      "What further muddies the perception of him are the statistics that can be twisted to fit whatever narrative you wish. Onana has kept as many clean sheets as Alisson Becker in three appearances more, but then again, he has been part of a dysfunctional defence that changes most weeks. He has made more saves than both Becker and clean sheet leader Jordan Pickford, but he has conceded more goals as well.",
      "It is difficult to fairly compare goalkeepers given the varying circumstances they perform in, and perhaps a more relevant one regards the specific trait he was signed to strengthen.",
      "Erik ten Hag targeted the signing of Onana in the summer, not only for his shot-stopping ability but also because of the distributional skills he was supposed to bring to the side.",
      "Yet he is averaging fewer passes per match than both Alisson and Pickford and sits at just seventh place for the most passes by a goalkeeper in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "This was opitimised at Villa Park when Onana awkwardly attempted to pass out from the back to Victor Lindelof, who lost possession and gifted Ollie Watkins a shot at goal, which was saved well. Onana was putting out fires all afternoon, but some of them were acts of arson in the first place.",
      "Another area of his game that has been unconvincing has been his positioning. He started the corner that resulted in Villa's goal in an unfavourable position, failed to reach the cross, and made a save before Douglas Luiz beat him a few seconds later. This was a De Gea esque performance in which fine saves masked underlying areas of concern.",
      "Again, you have to look at the bigger picture. Onana is still very much a work in progress, and there is hope he will get even better once he is playing behind a settled back-four, a luxury he has rarely been afforded. Yet at the same time, United spent £47.2 million on him in the summer window, and he hasn't been that much of an upgrade of De Gea, if even one at all.",
      "Onana deserves more credit than criticism for his performance at Villa Park, but it is in the wake of triumph that the most brutal reflection is required.",

      "McTominay netted in the 86th-minute at Villa Park as United made it three straight victories in the Premier League to boost their Champions League qualification hopes. The 27-year-old was similarly heroic in the wins against Brentford and Chelsea earlier in the campaign and has scored seven goals in 21 top-flight games.",
      "The midfielder was made available for transfer last summer, but a move did not materialise, while former players, including Paul Scholes, have not always been glowing about the Academy graduate. Owen, though, reckons United can only \"ignore\" McTominay and his worth for so long.",
      "Problems in the engine room at United have been well documented since before Casemiro was signed and youngster Kobbie Mainoo burst on to the scene, with McTominay and long-term partner Fred often picked apart by Scholes and other TV pundits for their performances in previous years.",
      "Assessing the 41-cap international last season, Scholes told Sky Sports: \"McTominay was always trying to run with the ball, which was ridiculous. The quality in the middle of the pitch was nowhere near good enough, but we've seen that for the last few years with these two [McTominay and Fred].\"",
      "Scholes softened his stance on the Academy graduate in the following months, but his one-time teammate Owen has gone one step further. Speaking about McTominay after Sunday afternoon's result and impact, he told Premier League Productions that the Scotland international could be \"absolutely anything\" for Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "\"He has got attributes that you can't really teach,\" commented Owen.",
      "\"His fitness levels, his size, his strength and the way he marauds forward. It's a fascinating conundrum because he has almost burst into my mind now and I'm thinking; 'Wow, you have to find a place for this type of player'. I never had him down by this type of player before, this real marauding midfielder.\"",
      "Owen then added: \"With his size and knack of scoring goals, you can only ignore that for so long. Okay, so he might not get ahead of Bruno [Casemiro] or Casemiro, at the moment, but if he keeps on doing what he's doing then you are going to have to find a role in the team.

Although technically a Glazers appointment, it is thought the move was that of Ratcliffe and INEOS, who now take over sporting control. Here is everything fans need to know regarding his arrival timeline over the next few months.",
      "Ratcliffe arrived at United on Christmas Eve after a 13-month takeover process from the Glazers. Any new investor at a Premier League club is required to pass the competition’s Owners’ & Directors’ Test before approval.",
      "This is not a quick process and can take a number of weeks. Given Ratcliffe’s arrival came during the festive period, it added a number of days onto the timeline. The FA also needs to give its nod of approval.",
      "There is no inkling that there will be any issue with this process, and club sources say those checks are nearing completion. Ratcliffe had initially indicated his tender offer stood until Wednesday but this has now been extended until Friday.",
      "Also known as the ‘fit and proper persons’ test’, the checks ensure any incoming investor has the necessary funds to complete and sustain the deal. It also assesses whether the people behind the deal have the credence to operate at such a high business level.",
      "The process is thought to take a ‘why shouldn't we approve’ approach, rather than a ‘why should we’. There have been calls for the Premier League to make its test stricter.",
      "Ratcliffe and his inner circle are due to take over the sporting departments of the club while the Glazers will oversee the commercial side. How this will play out long-term is unclear but it is assumed INEOS will be given full reins on football matters.",
      "There is still unclarity over how transfers may be finalised, given these are both sporting and commercial. As majority shareholders, the Glazers have the final say but, as former CEO David Gill said earlier this month, the Americans never said no to a signing during Sir Alex Ferguson’s reign.",
      "Initially, Ratcliffe will be expected to reshuffle the boardroom having already overseen the arrival of Berrada amid Sir Dave Brailsford's audit assessment. Newcastle chief Dan Ashworth is being targeted for the sporting director role with John Murtough’s future in the balance.",
      "More changes could be made ahead of an important summer. Transfer decisions will need to be made on Jadon Sancho as well as the out-of-contract Raphael Varane, with defensive and attacking reinforcement needed.",

      "This year, England started with eight teams in European football - four in the Champions League, three in the Europa League and one in the Europa Conference League. Now, only six Premier League teams remain, with Newcastle United and Manchester United no longer in the top competition.",
      "Interestingly, English football teams have scored more points than their Italian and German rivals (England 109, Italy 98, Germany 95.5). But, because there were fewer teams from Italy and Germany playing, their average score per team is higher than the English teams. England, Italy, and Germany all have a strong showing in the knockout round. Each country will be trying to get enough coefficient points to get an extra team in the Champions League.",
      "There's something important to remember. Some teams - but not the English ones - will play the knockout playoff round in the Europa League and the Europa Conference League this week and next. This means they can add points to their national association score, but not every club gets this chance.",
      "Winning a group gets you more bonus points - something Liverpool, West Ham and Brighton did in the Europa League, and Aston Villa did in the Conference League. But, the runners-up can potentially get more points as they play in the knockout playoff round, while all group winners go straight into the last 16.",
      "Europa League group winners get four bonus points, while the runners-up get two. However, if the runners-up win both matches in the knockout playoff round, they can get an additional four points.",
      "So, which matches should we keep an eye on?",
      "In the Champions League, English teams have got lucky with their matches: Arsenal will play Porto while Manchester City, the reigning European champions, will face Copenhagen. Meanwhile, big threats from Italy, Germany, and Spain are set to play each other, which could lower their coefficient points: Inter Milan will play Atletico Madrid; Napoli will go head-to-head with Barcelona; RB Leipzig will take on Real Madrid, and Lazio will meet Bayern Munich.",
      "French teams could also do well, with four of their six teams in the knockout playoff round. Lens, Marseille, Rennes, and Toulouse are all ready to play, while PSG and Lille have already moved on to the last 16 of their respective tournaments.",
      "As for the Premier League, it looks like a three-horse race for the top four between City, Liverpool, and Arsenal. Tottenham, currently in fourth place, will be trying to keep off challenges from Manchester United and Aston Villa.",
      "The fifth spot in the Premier League could be key for Champions League qualification. Man City, Liverpool and Villa are favourites to win their respective competitions, which could lead to an English clean sweep. If this happens, a fifth English team will likely join the Champions League - and that could be good news for Manchester United.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan believes Erik ten Hag's switch to a more direct style of football and the return of Casemiro from injury have been vital to the Reds' recent results.",
      "United headed into Sunday's clash with Aston Villa knowing a defeat would all but end any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League. However, a dogged display in the West Midlands has brought United back into contention.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund gave United the lead in the first half from close range before Villa bagged a deserved equaliser from Douglas Luiz with less than half an hour to go. With momentum seemingly with the hosts, the Reds struck late to bag all three points.",
      "A cross from Diogo Dalot was superbly headed home by substitute Scott McTominay as Ten Hag's team moved within six points of the top four. Reflecting on his old club's recent success, Strachan told Lord Ping why he thinks it has turned around for the Reds.",
      "\"Have Manchester United turned a corner? I think there are a couple of things that have made a big difference to Erik ten Hag over the last few weeks: The return of Casemiro and Manchester United becoming very effective from set plays and playing a more direct brand of football,\" he explained.",
      "\"Casemiro makes a massive difference to Manchester United. I know people have said that he hasn’t been at his best this season; he’s slow, but he’s one of those players that when you’re a manager standing in the dugout watching the match, you think to yourself: ‘Thank goodness he’s here’. Casemiro is a big player for United.",
      "\"I think everyone was probably expecting Erik ten Hag to produce a similar playing style to his Ajax team, but the Premier League is a different kettle of fish. It’s been harder for his players to play in a fluid style that is similar to what we’ve seen from the likes of Tottenham this season.",
      "\"If you shut your eyes for ten minutes and opened them up, Manchester United would still be in the same place (on the pitch). Against Villa, the delivery for McTominay that Dalot whipped in was like a David Beckham cross.",
      "\"The first goal came from Harry Maguire winning a header at a corner and Hojlund picking up the second ball. It’s a back-to-basics kind of style and height and power has won them the game.\"",

      "While a fifth-placed finish may yet grant access to next season's expanded Champions League should UEFA coefficient points work out kindly for English teams, the battle for fourth is heating up - and a key injury during United's win may yet swing the race against Unai Emery's men. Boubacar Kamara suffered what looked to be a worrying injury during the second half of the game, limping off after treatment on the pitch - and Villa's worst fears have now been realised.",
      "On Monday, Villa announced that their star midfielder will mist the rest of the 2023/24 season with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury: \"Aston Villa can confirm Boubacar Kamara has suffered a significant knee ligament injury. The midfielder sustained the damage during yesterday's fixture with Manchester United and has subsequently undergone a scan this morning. Kamara's condition will be reviewed ahead of a further consultation with a knee specialist.\"",
      "Kamara, a France international, has been a big part of Villa's unexpected success this season. Together with Douglas Luiz, the 24-year-old has played in 30 games this season. Without him, Villa will be short of players in midfield - and the timing is particularly cruel on Emery given the January transfer window shut less than two weeks ago. Youri Tielemans, Jacob Ramsey and Tim Oregbunam are likely to take Kamara's place in the middle of the park, while John McGinn might also be called upon.",
      "Though United have work to do to chase down Villa and Tottenham - while also looking over their shoulders at the likes of Newcastle United - the loss of Kamara could prove a hammer blow to Villa at a time when Erik ten Hag's men are hitting the sort of form needed to mount a serious challenge for the top four.",

      "Those six group games will stay in the memory, but for all the wrong reasons. The home game against FC Copenhagen was the only one that was won and that required Andre Onana to save a penalty with the final touch of the game.",
      "It felt like much of United's European campaign centred around Onana and Rasmus Hojlund. The penalty save from the former was outweighed by the mistakes he made in the other group games, while Hojlund's flashes of potential were pointless given the flurry of goals going in at the opposite end.",

The £47million goalkeeper is starting to come up with some big saves and the Danish striker has added goals in the Premier League to his haul in the Champions League. Unfortunately, they've aligned too late to rescue this continental campaign.",

That they managed to make a mess of it sums up their efforts in Europe in recent years. Damningly, they have won just one of their last nine Champions League fixtures.",
      "At a time when the future of Old Trafford is up for debate, it is the iconic nights under the lights that are flooding the memory bank for some supporters keen to make sure that history isn’t bulldozed. The reality is those famous European nights are retreating into the distance.",
      "Since 2013 United have played just six knockout ties in the Champions League, beating only Olympiakos in 2014 and Paris St-Germain in 2019, in a Parisian night that is beginning to feel like a fever dream given what has happened since.",
      "Of the 12 individual fixtures in the knockout rounds, only two have been won. That rescue act against Olympiakos in the David Moyes season and that 3-1 win in Paris. There have been three draws and seven defeats. Bayern Munich, Sevilla, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have knocked United out of the Champions League without enduring too much stress.",
      "In the summer it felt like Erik ten Hag was making progress at Old Trafford and after that Champions League draw another attempt at finally leaving a mark on the knockout stages seemed more than plausible. That they somehow conspired to not even salvage a chance at the Europa League was disastrous.",
      "Maybe now it will reveal its benefits. This week Erik ten Hag has a free midweek to prepare his side for an awkward trip to Luton Town on Sunday. The following week the focus will entirely be on Fulham at home.",
      "The schedule is hardly relentless from here on in. As things stand, United have just two midweek fixtures to fulfil, at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup fifth round and at Chelsea in the Premier League at the start of April. That will change if they continue to progress in the FA Cup.",
      "Fourteen Premier League matches remain for United and every one is a cup final, according to Ten Hag. Sunday’s gutsy win at Villa Park has put them right back in the conversation for Champions League qualification.",

      "The worth of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's liquid assets has been confirmed.",
      "On Christmas Eve, Manchester United announced that the 71-year-old reached an agreement with the Glazer Family to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the club, subject to Premier League ratification. In an official statement, Ratcliffe vowed to 'provide funds intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford'.",
      "The INEOS chairman also insisted that he aims to take United back to the 'the very top of English, European and world football'. In order to fulfil such ambitious plans, Ratcliffe will have to fork out millions, upon millions of great British pounds to fund a seismic rebuild – on and off the pitch.",
      "Luckily for United supporters, the British billionaire isn't short of cash – and he seems prepared to spend it too ahead of what could be a pivotal next couple of months. As filed on the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, a Manchester United plc tender offer statement was uploaded on February 12, 2024, detailing Ratcliffe's deal.",
      "An extract from a letter to shareholders reads: \"As of February 12, 2024, James A. Ratcliffe’s liquid assets (primarily consisting of cash and readily marketable securities) were in excess of $4 billion (£3.2bn).\"",
      "\"James A. Ratcliffe’s net worth is significantly in excess of those liquid assets, primarily consists of his ownership in the INEOS Group and not subject to material guarantees or contingencies that would adversely affect his net worth.\" Forbes estimates Ratcliffe's overall net worth to be $20.2n billion ($16bn).",
      "The tender offer statement later detailed the breakdown of the total shares which Ratcliffe agreed to buy. The document reads: \"The total amount of funds required for Purchaser to complete the purchase of the Sale Shares, the Closing Share Subscription and the Subsequent Share Subscription will be approximately $909 million (£719.3m), $200 million (£158.3m) and $100 million (£79.1m), respectively, for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.21 billion (£960m).",
      "\"... And, together with the amount of funds required to purchase the Class A Shares pursuant to the Offer, assuming a number of Class A Shares greater than or equal to the Offer Cap are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn as described in Section 4 — \"Withdrawal Rights\"), an aggregate amount of approximately $1.65 billion (£1.31bn).\"",
      "With over $4 billion in liquid assets and the takeover almost complete, United look well positioned to undergo a significant makeover which sees Ratcliffe stay true to his word. It remains to be seen exactly how much money the Brit will set aside – but he's certainly not short of cash.",

      "Man United are interested in the possibility of bringing Jeremie Frimpong to Old Trafford, but it could result in a huge change being required to get the best out of him.",
      "Manchester United plan to strengthen their defensive options with the addition of a new right-back and centre-back in this forthcoming summer's transfer window.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News back in September, United have provisionally planned to make four statement signings ahead of next season, with two of them set to have a defensive focus. United are understood to be once again monitoring Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba, both of whom were on their radar last year.",
      "Both of them have played starring roles in Leverkusen's unexpected pursuit of the Bundesliga title this season, meaning it is hardly surprising they are generating interest from a club of United's ilk. Frimpong, in particular, has made impressive progress this season, playing a key role in the success of Xabi Alonso's team.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, 23, has contributed a very impressive eight goals and 10 assists in all competitions this term, the bulk of which have come in the Bundesliga. However, his attacking output does raise questions about how he has been able to be so fruitful as a right-back.",
      "The answer is simple: Frimpong plays as a right-sided wing-back for Leverkusen, being allowed to push high on the right flank. Leverkusen play with a back-three, allowing their wing-backs to get high up the field and into advanced areas of the pitch.",
      "In the opposite wing-back berth, Spaniard Alejandro Grimaldo has scored 11 goals and registered 10 assists. Leverkusen pack their midfield and central areas, allowing Frimpong and Grimaldo to bomb forward and get into attacking areas, meaning they are essentially right and left midfielders respectively.",
      "Should Frimpong make the switch to Old Trafford in the summer, the Dutchman is unlikely to be as expressive and as threatening in a 4-3-3 formation, where he would be expected to carry out the duty of a more orthodox right-back. Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have shared the role between them over the past 12 months, meaning United do need to source a permanent figurehead for that area of the team, though the former has been impressive in recent weeks.",
      "In a 4-3-3 system, Frimpong is likely to be tested a lot more defensively than he has been in a 3-4-3 system at Leverkusen. United manager Erik ten Hag also likes his full-backs to tuck inside in an inverted role and help pack the midfield, something which Frimpong does not do at Leverkusen, with his pace and energy used to exploit spaces out wide.",
      "With that said, Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman's doubts about Frimpong's defensive capabilities could heed as a warning to United. The former Everton chief, speaking in March last year, suggested he had left him out of his squad because of his limitations defensively.",
      "Koeman said: \"No Frimpong? This is because of the system that we play in.",
      "\"He plays almost as a right-winger. My right-back should be able to defend well in the first place and I have my doubts about that.\"",
      "With that said, Ten Hag, if he adds Frimpong to his squad this summer, may be forced to consider a change in shape to get the best out of his fellow countryman. That, however, is unlikely, with almost all of United's football under him having been played in a 4-3-3.",
      "As impressive as Frimpong has been for Leverkusen this season, United cannot undo all of their hard work and understanding of Ten Hag's preferred system to accommodate just one player. United's current situation at right-back features one player who is arguably the best one-vs-one defender in the world in Wan-Bissaka, and Dalot, who is much more accomplished going forward.",
      "If Frimpong can offer a balance between the two, he would be a perfect fit. However, warnings about his defensive capabilities, such is the formation United play, cannot be ignored.",

      "After all, it was his 17th-minute opener that had been wiped out by Douglas Luiz and looked set to halt United's three-game winning run. Just as he did against Tottenham Hotspur, Wolves and West Ham United, Hojlund scored before half-time.",
      "After crafting his best goal in United colours thus far against West Ham, his deadlock-breaking finish at Villa Park was not quite as glamorous. Connecting with Harry Maguire's header, the former Atalanta man was in the right place at the right time to turn the ball home and claim his 11th of the season in all competitions.",
      "Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the 21-year-old's record for United has gone from looking underwhelming to incredibly respectful. Five goals in as many league appearances, plus one in the FA Cup against Newport County, has been him more than double his tally for the campaign in seven weeks.",
      "On current form, it feels as though there is no way of stopping him. Confidence is flowing through his veins and that is being reflected in his all-round performances.",
      "Ever since he scored his first-ever Premier League goal against Villa on Boxing Day, he has been a different player. Though his goals have been the headline moments of his recent outings, his all-round game has been much-improved, with his awareness, positioning, movement off the ball and general link-up play much sharper.",
      "United took a huge gamble when selecting Hojlund to become the new face of their forward line, particularly for such a lavish fee, but it is now becoming clear why it was one they were prepared to take. It was always going to take time for him to adapt to the demands of English football and develop a firm understanding of his teammates and Erik ten Hag's demands.",
      "But even when he could not buy a goal, Ten Hag stuck with the striker, whose love and desire to give everything for United shone through again at Villa Park. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and United's fans are quickly falling in love.",
      "His current run of form, which has seen him score five goals in six matches in all competitions, with only Wigan Athletic successfully keeping him off the scoresheet in 2024 thus far, has come as a welcome surprise to most. Nobody could have possibly foreseen his United career going from zero to 100mph in the way it has.",
      "Ten Hag might have, though. After Hojlund had ended his wait for a first league goal at the 16th attempt, the Dutchman backed the youngster to go on a run, inspired by an injection of confidence.",
      "\"I have had several talks with him,\" said Ten Hag, speaking after the Boxing Day triumph over Villa. \"I pointed out that you scored for Denmark a lot, you scored in the Champions League, you have demonstrated the ability, so you can do it.",
      "\"Believe in it and it will come. I am sure now the first goal is in, he will get more.\"",
      "Ten Hag also admitted Hojlund's confidence as a striker would increase once the goals started flowing, adding: \"Of course, when strikers don't score that is always a problem but he has a strong character and is always so determined.",
      "\"He has a big personality and that is what a striker needs. And when you keep investing, the goals will come.\"",
      "Ten Hag was not wrong, was he? Hojlund's character and mindset has been striking throughout his United career thus far. He speaks well and you can sense his hunger and determination to make a success of himself at Old Trafford.",
      "His current run in front of goal is guaranteed to come to an end at some point, presenting another challenge to get back among the goals as fast as possible. Nevertheless, Hojlund has demonstrated he has the character and resilience to overcome the most frustrating and difficult of periods.",
      "He has silenced Villa's fans twice and you would argue he will be silencing more sets of supporters between now and May.",

At under-21 level, City have won the Premier League 2 for the last three seasons, and have seen a host of talented youngsters come through the ranks to break into the first team at the Etihad and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "This season, however, things are different. City haven't particularly changed their form or momentum, but are facing a new challenge from a familiar rival. The problem is that Manchester United are simply too good.",
      "City have only dropped points in four of their 13 games this term, but from 15 games in the U18 Premier League North division, United have won 14 and drawn once - and that came last weekend. They beat City in a close affair at Carrington last month to see their lead currently stand at 15 points, albeit with City having two games in hand.",
      "As Wilkinson concedes, City will have to be 'near faultless' to catch their local neighbours and retain their title this season.",

It feels weird being second and a distance behind, but that's more the pace that Man United have set. They deserve credit for how well they've done.",
      "\"It's a big gap, they've done fantastically well to get to the stage they have done. It's also nice for us to see the lads in a slightly different mode where they're coming from behind and on the back foot.\"",
      "With United running away with the league, City have 11 games to pull off the incredible and reel them back in, including a showdown at the Joie Stadium in March. Centre-back Kian Noble isn't giving up on the title just yet, telling United that they will be in for a game when they arrive at the Etihad Campus.",

We know them, been playing them for years. Obviously through the England pathway as well. They're close mates at the same time.",
      "\"I can't wait for them to come here. Give them a game. We gave them a game at Carrington but didn't take our chances. They showed at the weekend they can drop points. We need to keep going, game by game, be ourselves, and keep trying to get three points every week.\"",
      "If the players haven't given up on the title, there is an acceptance that it might be taken away from them with the City academy going far stronger in cup competitions this season than in the leagues. Wednesday sees the under-18s host Reading in the fifth round of the FA Youth Cup, while the young Blues have semi-finals in the under-16, under-17 and under-18 versions of the Premier League Cup.",
      "The under-21s are struggling massively in the revamped Premier League 2, but are going well in Europe and face Mainz next week in the UEFA Youth League in a hectic schedule that may soon see coaches have to prioritise some games over others.",
      "\"The hardest thing we have with that is wanting to try and win that league, but also the volume of games we have in other competitions,\" Wilkinson explains.",
      "\"It's just trying to balance those things because the players can't play every game. The great thing is they're getting an experience that looks like the first team - they play every midweek until the international break. That's the life of a Man City footballer. I'm pleased that it gives them exposure to not having an off day and going every three or four days even when you're not feeling your best.",
      "\"In theory, we have to win a lot less games to win the cups than to win the league. We're going to have to be near faultless in the league I'd have thought. We'll take it game by game, but when you have injuries stacking up and games every three days, at some point you might have to shift focus a little bit and start to prioritise one or two games over others to make sure you get through them.\"",
      "Another obstacle facing Wilkinson is the different places various players have to be that will make some unavailable for key games like the Youth Cup clash on Wednesday.",
      "Jacob Wright and Mahamadou Susoho are in Copenhagen with the first team for the Champions League this week, while Tom Galvez, Joel Ndala and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey were all training with Pep Guardiola's squad on Monday. Others played for the under-21s on Sunday, further disrupting the Youth League preparations.",
      "\"In the squad we've got a lot of experience from playing in Youth Cups, with the first team, in the World Cup with England. When this group gets together and plays at the same age, it's a very experienced group,\" Wilkinson explains. \"If we ever do get to a point, hopefully we're still in the competition, where we can get our best XI out, we've got a real strong group.",
      "\"The rest of the group deserve credit as well, it shows the strength in depth that we've missed a lot of players and still progressed with two really good performances and results.\"",
      "With that in mind, the Youth Cup represents a great chance of lifting silverware this season, with memories of last season's heartbreaking semi-final exit at Arsenal still fresh. For Noble, he says the squad is looking to take the cup form into the league, starting with progression to the next round of the Youth Cup on Wednesday.",
      "\"We're doing well in the cups, it's credit to the player,\" he explained. \"We've kept going in the tough moments. We've stuck together and shown our togetherness. Hopefully we can translate that into the league and go on a run now.\"",
      "City will continue to take things one game at a time, and certainly won't be throwing the towel in against United any time soon. However, after years of dominating the league programme in the academy world, maybe this is the year that City start to bring home more cups that have eluded them in the past.",

      "Williams will lead on the recruitment of what United describe as \"high-potential talent\", with the aim of those players joining the club's development programme. He joins the club from Championship side Ipswich Town, where he has been working as the club's head of recruitment, most recently under former United coach Kieran McKenna, who is now the club's manager.",

      "The black-and-white portrait of McTominay was taken mere months after his Manchester United debut when he was aged 20. Rashford is no older than 16 and a 17-year-old Garnacho is hoisting the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Tom Heaton and Paul McShane, back at Carrington in playing and coaching roles, also appear in an embrace from 2005 when United's reserves won the FA Premier Reserve League Shield at Charlton Athletic. \"I don't know what Paul McShane's doing up there,\" jokes the affable academy head Nick Cox.",
      "FROM 2022: 'Fernandes and Eriksen were both laughing' - the new mood at United's training complex",
      "The message is clear: all five academy graduates - goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, winger and forward - have represented their countries and played regularly in the Premier League. All five drive through the Carrington barriers daily.",
      "The photographs are married with monochrome shots of Manchester Town Hall and the city skyline. \"We've spent so much time trying to reconnect everybody back to Manchester,\" Cox explains, \"to our history but also to the city.\"",
      "United have held academy staff meetings at the Museum of Science and Industry and invited folk from the city to present to them. Tony Walsh, a lifelong United fan who uttered the immortal This Is The Place poem days after the Manchester Arena attack, struck a chord. \"It's the balance of a global brand but still feeling like an intimate family,\" Cox explains.",
      "Inside the new academy gym, goalkeeper Tom Wooster is lifting weights with a coach, Shola Shoretire, Ashton Missin and Malachi Sharpe are loosening up on an exercise bike, preparing to brace the lashing rain.",
      "When we eventually leave the £9million extension, four sodden and muddied lads are removing their boots after a morning training session. The doors to the new building opened in October, 20 years after the dedicated academy centre was opened by Sirs Alex Ferguson and Bobby Charlton.",
      "The latest addition is part of the one-club approach, with the women's team also housed on the premises. Before construction started, the exterior of the original academy building was graced by a timeline of graduates from the men's and women's teams, starting with Busby Babes captain Roger Byrne and ending with women's captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cox has been the United academy head since 2019 and has overseen an exceptional period, even by the dream factory's standards. United have passed 4,000 consecutive matches with an academy member in a matchday squad, 22 have debuted for the first team, with Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo already indispensable.",
      "The pair were totemic during the FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022, an uplifting run in an unedifying season. Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalls his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside.",
      "Mainoo hails from Stockport and Brexit has forced United to look more intensely within their borders as they cannot recruit overseas talents aged under 18. That is a challenge the club have embraced and they have a precedent for blending homegrown British talent with continental clout.",
      "\"Think of the best United teams, the best United youth teams,\" Cox begins. \"It's always been a core of local boys who understand the club, understand the city, what it means to the local people and then elite incomers, the best around, who bring innovation and maybe a different slant on things.",
      "\"I remember talking to Nicky Butt. He and the lads showed Ronaldo or Eric Cantona the club and they said, 'By the way, this is what I eat and I go and train twice a day.' So the lads were like, we'll follow suit.",
      "\"And that goes back to youth teams that would've had Bobby Charlton in it, arriving not from Manchester, or George Best, David Beckham, or Paul Pogba or whether it's Alejandro Garnacho. That's a bit of an unofficial blend.",
      "\"It's become a bit harder post-Brexit but our talent pool now is very much a UK talent pool, it changes the challenge a little bit but the concept is still the same. How do you make sure you've exhausted local talent?",
      "\"This place has to provide opportunities for local players, first and foremost, we've got to give everyone the chance. But then how do we add from further afield to make sure we've got a pool of high-potential talent that has to go and support a winning first team? That's the challenge.\"",
      "United arranged flexible deadline day loans for Wooster, Sam Murray, Sam Mather and Sonny Aljofree to support local non-league clubs Macclesfield, Rochdale and Altrincham. Murray is one of the youngsters drying off downstairs while Mather and Aljofree have both been involved in first-team training sessions this month.",
      "Cox has always downplayed the presence of unknown quantities suddenly rubbing shoulders with first-teamers in club imagery and footage. \"It's always been commonplace but even more so under this manager, our boys will be in and around to support first-team training,\" he reiterates.",
      "\"There are probably two versions of support he needs. The academy provides two services: the academy has got to develop players who can play in that team and the other is to support that team to prepare to win.",
      "\"So recovery days, maybe when the manager's got a smaller group, we will add to that smaller group so they can have a proper, functional training session. So anyone who's not played, say there are eight remaining players, plus our 10 to make a training group so they can have a high-level functional session.",
      "\"But then on a normal training day there'll still be three, four or five lads over there. Some on merit, some just because it's the right positional fit. And the challenge for the boys is to really make a name for themselves. That jump to the first team.",
      "\"Everyone asks me, 'How do you decide? When do you decide?' There's never a day, there's always this movement back.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag is prompt on providing feedback. \"Darren Fletcher (technical director) is the biggest conduit, really,\" Cox stresses. \"He is unbelievable at managing that period where they have one foot in each camp and then me and my staff are providing feedback as well.",
      "\"John Murtough is involved in there. There's this ongoing regular discussion around where they are at, what help do they need, what does the next month look like.\"",
      "The academy is approaching another milestone. After Omari Forson's cameo against Wigan Athletic in last month's FA Cup third-round win, United are on 249 academy graduates to have played for the first team. Joe Hugill was an unused substitute that evening and has since joined Burton Albion on loan.",
      "Willy Kambwala was an unlikely presence in the starting XI at West Ham United two days before Christmas. Such unexpected promotions are the beauty of United's faith in youth.",
      "\"Every debut brings us great pride,\" Cox beams. \"As a youth developer, I take great pride from a number of sources about kids being successful.",
      "\"Debuts are obviously a more public-facing event that brings great satisfaction and noise and brings external interest. It’s amazing when young people debut here because when they come here that is what they set out to do.",
      "\"I enjoyed watching the debuts this year – Willy, Dan Gore, Omari – it’s great to see kids make debuts. We should definitely celebrate it and it is a landmark that they will remember forever.",
      "\"But it really is the beginning of the new journey. Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it. We have seen many kids at this club make one appearance and no more, and for them, they are focused and determined, driven. They know it’s a nice moment but they want to be in the team next week. They want to be in the team.",
      "\"They want to get to where Alejandro’s at. He has been in and around the squad. But now he is about to make his 20th consecutive appearance. That is when you start to think okay, 20 games in a row, that’s something. I am now starting to establish myself.",
      "\"249 is a really nice statistic because it encapsulates the great work of a number of amazing people over 90-odd years. That first debut was 1931, so all of those debuts leading us to this point, I think the beauty of that is that it’s not fabricated, it’s not forced, it’s just organic, and only recently have we just established that it’s 249.",
      "\"This club gives young people opportunities and puts players in the team. 249 is lovely. 250. Who will it be? That is the beauty of my job. We have a number of high-potential players. Knowing which one it might be next is harder but I am looking forward to seeing now how Kobbie has developed.\"",

      "The youngster trained with the first team on Wednesday afternoon in preparation for Aston Villa and he was joined by Sam Mather (19) and Toby Collyer (20). It's unusual for a 16-year-old to train with the senior group but Amass was selected to make up the numbers.",

      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",

      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "You start to get into the game a lot more and the confidence rises. Those chances keep coming and you start to take them.",
      "In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it.",
      "If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.",

      "Harry Maguire was named player of the match for United against Villa.",
      "It was a good performance and I'm pleased for him. He's a worker and he puts his body on the line. If I was playing, he's the type of player you'd want in your team.",
      "However, there's a thin line between centre-backs doing well and not doing well.",
      "Aston Villa created so many chances and if they take some of them we are having a different conversation.",

      "However it was Maguire and United's day.",
      "He's a threat in both boxes and what I like is that when he is up for a corner he tries to score and have an effect on the game. A lot of defenders just go up and go through the motions. They are only up because the manager told them to go up.",
      "Man Utd are on a good run and have a good run of fixtures coming up, but they will have to keep winning games.",
      "Tottenham also have good fixtures coming up as this race for the Champions League starts to get interesting.",
      "But like with Hojlund, Man Utd are now full of confidence. Hojlund is scoring goals now, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are threats on the wing.",
      "I still think their game-management is poor. There are still moments when they are giving the ball away so cheaply and making the wrong decisions, and it did catch up with them as Villa piled on some continuous pressure.",
      "When they can learn that side of the game United will be a much better team.",
      "They are always going to score goals with Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho. They just need to keep things tight at the back because for me, it will be very rare if they come off pitches between now and the end of the season without goals.",
      "Aston Villa played really well against Man Utd, but they still came out on the losing side. That is a little bit of worry.",
      "Villa created so many chances. If they create that many in another game they probably get all three points.",
      "Villa will be disappointed. You can take it when you don't play well and lose, it's just one of those things, but there is nothing worse than playing well and losing football matches.",
      "Their last five fixtures haven't been the easiest. Everton is a hard place to go, on their day Newcastle can beat anyone, Chelsea were going to click one day and then there's United.",
      "It's not like Villa have played four teams at the bottom. They have played decent teams and just haven't got the results.",
      "The name of the game now for Villa is to get back on the horse, win their next game and go again. They've got to get back to winning ways quickly.",
      "When you are winning week in, week out the players and the fans would have been turning up expecting to win with their 13th, 14th and so on victory on the trot at home.",
      "But all of a sudden, Newcastle did a job on them. Then Chelsea wiped the floor with them and now United have won. It did get nervy at the end of the game for Villa.",
      "They have got to get back to winning ways quickly. They are where they are in this league because of their home record and they've got to get winning again at Villa Park.",
      "Arsenal are now putting their chances away and working hard",
      "If you want to win the Premier League, you have to bounce back [from defeats] as quickly as you can and they have done that. That is what Man City do and they have worked hard and been hard to beat.",
      "And fair play to them, they are right in this title race.",
      "It is just a massive result, it has done the goal difference the world of good - if this was Man City today who had wonthat game 6-0, we would be waxing lyrical.",

      "Although Chelsea are far from the prospect of old, they still pose numerous dangers - as Crystal Palace would heartbreakingly come to realise - but what the Eagles did do was show there is life even without their talismen.",
      "The first half especially would have been everything the fans and staff would have wanted from the team. They wanted the ball more than Chelsea, they fought harder, created more and took their chances.",
      "It saw them leave to a standing ovation at half-time, but could not quite replicate the same form in the second half. This may have been more to do with Chelsea improvement and tactical tweaks, but lapses in their own concentration also hurt them in the end.",
      "But for however long their trio are out for, Crystal Palace have shown they can compete. They will need all the heart they can muster - a lot of it on show on Monday Night Football - to keep themselves from the tail of a relegation battle.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Having struggled to convert their dominance into goals for much of the season, Arsenal now can't stop scoring. Their six-goal thrashing of West Ham on Sunday made it 16 in their last four games.",
      "Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool were swatted aside. But this, their fourth consecutive win, was their most devastating display yet; their biggest away victory in Premier League history and another statement about their credentials.",
      "This is a serious team. Already the best in the league defensively, they have now found a level of cutting edge to match. The game at the London Stadium was just the latest reminder of their potency from set-pieces. But they were rampant from open play too.",
      "There is no out-and-out No 9 capable of rivalling Erling Haaland's scoring exploits, of course. But Arsenal are sharing the goals out. Against West Ham, there were five different scorers. They threatened from all angles. West Ham could not cope.",
      "Bukayo Saka's double puts him on five goals from his last five Premier League games and he is not the only attacking player to have hit a rich vein of form at what feels like the right time. Leandro Trossard has three in his last four. Gabriel Martinelli too.",
      "The fluidity of their front line was too much for West Ham, with Martin Odegaard orchestrating proceedings and Kai Havertz constantly finding space to exploit. The fact they still have Gabriel Jesus to return from injury is another source of encouragement.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United are salvaging what at times has been a calamitous season. Three unlikely lads are helping on that front.",
      "Harry Maguire, Scott McTominay and Diogo Dalot. All three stepped up to the plate at Villa Park in what could just be a victory that completely changes the trajectory of where United are going this season.",
      "Maguire was given player-of-the-match by Gary Neville - a performance full of grit and aerial dominance in both boxes.",
      "McTominay was the match-winner with a barnstorming header - his seventh goal of the Premier League season, no player has scored more for United.",
      "And, Dalot was exemplary with the ball, including his cross for the McTominay winner. He looks every inch a Manchester United right-back now, even for the longer-term.",
      "All three players have been linked with a move away from the club in the past 18 months but the lure of being a Manchester United player has been too big for them to give up when push came to shove. You can tell they really care playing for the club - and you can't have too many of those in your squad when trying to build a successful football team.",
      "They have their imperfections but you can't knock their contributions.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had clawed it back to 1-1 against Manchester United and were pushing for a winner. Looking dangerous and more likely to get the crucial third goal, Unai Emery took Leon Bailey off.",
      "\"It was tactical,\" he told Sky Sports after the game. The fact he had to answer questions on it says a lot.",
      "Bailey was running the show down the Villa right. He set up the equaliser, no Villa player had more successful one-on-ones than him, half-time Man Utd substitute Victor Lindelof was having a torrid time. Gary Neville was calling for Diogo Dalot to swap with Lindelof to stop the tide.",
      "Bringing Bailey off let Man Utd off the hook. Erik ten Hag responded by making a positive substitution himself with matchwinner Scott McTominay. The Man Utd manager won the battle of the dugouts.Sam Blitz",
      "Freak results are a part of football, an unavoidable reality. There is, however, a way in which a team can lose on such days. West Ham's capitulation against Arsenal on Sunday certainly wasn't that.",
      "Watching Arsenal score four goals in 15 first-half minutes was shocking enough but what made it more jaw-dropping was the inevitability of it all. There was an almost immediate surrender, which Bukayo Saka, scorer of two goals, said Arsenal could sense.",
      "\"We smelt blood today and went for the kill,\" the 22-year-old told Sky Sports.",
      "David Moyes admitted this was one of the darkest days in his 26 years as a manager, but rightly reminded us that it wasn't so long ago that they were enjoying some of the best days in the club's recent history.",
      "The issue he faces is the disconnect he has with the fans who crave a more attacking brand of football. Results like this, despite Moyes' safety-first approach, don't help the manager's cause. The discontent among the naysayers will only grow after this historic defeat.Zinny Boswell",

      "Monday 12 February 2024 12:09, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United are \"still not great\" despite continuing their winning run at Aston Villa, while Roy Keane says Erik ten Hag's side have \"got away with it\" in their recent results.",
      "Scott McTominay's late header in the 2-1 victory made it five wins and one draw from six matches in all competitions in 2024, with United now five points behind fifth-placed Villa in a major boost to their Champions League hopes.",
      "Sky Sports pundit Neville says United do have what it takes to finish above Villa in fifth, with Tottenham a point ahead of Unai Emery's side in fourth, but has played down the recent revival.",
      "\"They can claw it back,\" said Neville about United's Champions League ambitions. \"They've been appalling in the first half of the season. They've lost so many matches it's untrue.",
      "\"If they keep their players fit, which is a big question mark because it looks like they've lost another two with [Lisandro] Martinez and [Luke] Shaw in the past week, they have got a chance. Because of course they are better when they have their strength in their team. All teams are when they have their players back.",
      "\"The front three look more settled with [Marcus] Rashford, [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Rasmus] Hojlund with Bruno Fernandes in behind.",
      "\"They're better than they were but they're still not great.",
      "\"They concede so many chances, they don't really have any patterns, they don't control games or keep possession better than the other teams. But they do have players who can win matches. They are an odd bunch, I've said that for a few years, they play in moments during matches.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Keane says Tottenham and Villa will be \"getting worried\" about United picking up results, but adds that Ten Hag's forwards are getting their defenders \"out of jail\".",
      "\"United still gave up loads of chances, the problems are still there for them,\" Keane said. \"They got away with it today, because the attacking players are scoring goals.",
      "\"But there's no surprise the amount of chances they give up, they do it every week. They've got away with it in three or four weeks. Their attacking players are getting them out of jail.",
      "\"The key for me is the attacking players are scoring goals. And what they've got, which Villa don't is that momentum.",
      "\"If you're in the Spurs and Villa dressing room and you see Man Utd coming up behind you, you're going to be worried. History will play a part, they've got the goals.\"",
      "Amongst the goals is United striker Hojlund, who has scored once in each of his last five Premier League games since Boxing Day.",
      "Fellow Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson says the Danish forward, who failed to score a Premier League goal before Christmas in his debut season, is going to be a \"superstar\" after overcoming his early United struggles.",
      "\"I like him. He's a young kid, 21 playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it.",
      "\"If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.",
      "\"He's a good player, I think he will be a superstar.\"",
      "Asked about Hojlund's improvement, Keane said: \"He's on fire, it took him a few months to get up to speed. He's part of a settled team now and he's got confidence.",
      "\"I believe every time he walks on the pitch, he thinks 'I'm going to score a goal for Man Utd'. It's a good return, considering the first few months he had. He's showing good form.",
      "\"You look at the lack of strikers at Man Utd. So the manager has been forced to play him week in and week out.",
      "\"The fact he's had to do that, and Ten Hag has had the option to take him out and give him a rest, is a big help.\"",
      "If Manchester United are to make up more ground on the Champions League-chasing teams, they will look at the next few matches with fondness, says Neville.",
      "Ten Hag's side go to Luton next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Their next league away game after that is a daunting trip to title-chasing Manchester City, but around those games are home matches to bottom half clubs Fulham, Everton and Sheffield United.",
      "\"That's a great run of fixtures. If you forget the Man City game, those six games… they don't deserve anything if they don't pick up anything against those teams.",
      "\"I wouldn't be confident going to Luton next week, but them and Fulham [are winnable]. Every team gets beaten at the Etihad Stadium but then you have Everton and Sheffield United at home.",
      "\"In terms of the league games they've got, the four around the City game, you wouldn't say they're not favourable.\""

      "Scott McTominay's late winner earned Manchester United a first away league victory against a top-nine side under Erik ten Hag, as Aston Villa were beaten 2-1 to blow the race for Champions League football wide open.",
      "In-form United started fast at Villa Park and took a deserved lead through Rasmus Hojlund's fifth goal in five Premier League games.",
      "Villa dominated the big chances but found Andre Onana in inspired form, with the United goalkeeper making four big saves, including two from Ollie Watkins.",
      "The pressure eventually told as Douglas Luiz fired home from Leon Bailey's cross with over 20 minutes to go - but United had the last laugh.",
      "Substitute McTominay headed Diogo Dalot's first-time cross in from close range with four minutes of normal time to play to earn United a precious three points, which moves them within five points of fifth-placed Villa.",
      "\"It's a massive win for us,\" said Ten hag to Sky Sports after the game. \"We get closer and that's the aim for today, that was absolutely our target and we did it. The way we did it, I liked it.",
      "\"I never think negative scenarios. I think positive. We know we have to catch up and we are not there yet. We are in a good mood and keep this process going.",
      "\"There is much room for improvement, if we do this and there are more games to play, let's see where it goes.\"",
      "Villa controlled the first-half possession but United looked dangerous on the break early on. Bruno Fernandes fed Hojlund in the penalty area only for the striker to sky his close-range effort, while Alejandro Garnacho blasted a long-range effort wide.",
      "Then came the opening goal as Fernandes' corner found Harry Maguire - who had escaped Boubacar Kamara's clutches - at the far post, leaving the onside Hojlund the simple task of tapping home.",
      "Villa's response to the early setback was excellent. John McGinn forced an acrobatic tip over from United goalkeeper Onana, who was also equal to Watkins' one-on-one inside the box as the hosts opened up Ten Hag's side in a sweeping move.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, who had a bright game in midfield, then put an effort from inside the box wide as Villa ended the opening period strongly.",
      "Man Utd took the influential Luke Shaw off at half-time due to injury and it took just three minutes for replacement Victor Lindelof to make a big error.",
      "The Swede gifted the ball to Matty Cash deep in the United half and he squared to Watkins who looked certain to score - but once again hit Onana.",
      "Ramsey had two more chances, failing to trap Bailey's incisive pass for a one-on-one, before seeing a low shot blocked by Dalot on the line.",
      "Eventually, the pressure told. Onana made another point-blank save from Clement Lenglet from a corner but, after United cleared, Bailey put the ball back in the mixer for Luiz to fire high into the net.",
      "United tried to respond straight away as Garnacho fired wide of the near post after a mazy run - but Villa stepped back on the throttle.",
      "Luiz had a big chance following Dalot's poor clearance but the midfielder failed to make a big connection. Substitute Moussa Diaby then curled over as Villa looked dangerous on the counter-attack.",
      "Back came United as Garnacho fired straight at Emiliano Martinez after another solo run. But United's late winner came from a familiar source.",
      "Dalot's instinctive cross was headed home by McTominay from close-range, which could be a massive goal in the context of the top-four race.",
      "Aston Villa: Martinez (6); Cash (7), Carlos (6), Lenglet (6), Moreno (7); Luiz (7), Kamara (5); McGinn (6), Ramsey (7); Bailey (7), Watkins (5)\n\n\nSubs used: Diaby (7), Tielemans (6), Zaniolo (n/a), Digne (n/a)\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (8); Dalot (7), Maguire (8), Varane (7), Shaw (6); Casemiro (6), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (7); Garnacho (7), Hojlund (7), Rashford (7)\n\n\nSubs used: Lindelof (5), McTominay (7), Amrabat (n/a), Evans (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Harry Maguire (Man Utd)",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag to Sky Sports:",
      "\"I liked especially the first 20 minutes, after that we were dropping too much. We had our moments in the counter attacks, but at 1-1 we had to fight back.",
      "\"It was really high intense, and you could see how many players were fatigued by the end. It was so open and it could have gone two ways. They had the mentality to win this day, especially the substitutes.",
      "\"Scott, he's great. He can score many goals, he's always coming in positions to score goals. We had some problems, it was too much like a tennis match. Every game we went for goal instead of waiting for the right decisions. With McTominay, he can get in the box and could score goals.",
      "\"Our defensive organistaion in the first part was very good, on the ball we were calm. Once we were winning, we changed our mindset. You can do this when the game is going to an end to play out the result. In the first 20 minutes we scored, why not keep going?\"",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery to Sky Sports:",
      "\"We did a good plan. We controlled the game, we avoided the transitions. We didn't concede a lot of chances to them and we got control of the game, not only controlling possession, we were even having chances. And we didn't score some clear chances.",
      "\"I am very proud of our work and our players. We are being more consistent in the league matches. But it is a tough evening for us and tough to accept. But that's football, we have to score more.",
      "\"We had the chances and sometimes we are being clinical, sometimes we have days like today. Against Manchester United you can lose, because they're clinical, but this is the way.",
      "\"I'm very proud of our work today, the players are proud. At the end we didn't win because we weren't clinical.\"",

      "Sunday 11 February 2024 07:56, UK",
      "It is an image which will be referenced and reused in years to come.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration at the Argentine's first goal in the win over West Ham, immediately struck as an iconic moment.",
      "But whether it will be looked back on as the dawning of a new era of success for United or a brief flash of promise which faded away will be down to that talented trio, the group around them and the work of head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "Promise is one thing but at United results are demanded right now.",
      "That was the message emphasised by Ten Hag as he sat down with Sky Sports at United's training ground, still warming up after a session out in the sleet and wind at Carrington. They were tough conditions, he says, but these are the decisive days - and even in February, United are in must-win mode.",
      "Back-to-back victories last week against Wolves and West Ham have boosted the mood - \"It gives confidence,\" says the Dutchman - but if the team are to achieve Champions League qualification, the eight-point gap to fourth-placed Aston Villa must be closed when United go to play Unai Emery's men on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "\"We have some exciting players,\" smiles Ten Hag when asked about Hojlund (aged 21), Garnacho (19) and Mainoo (18) sat together.",
      "\"We also have had such [standout] moments during the season - for instance, the brilliant goal from Garnacho against Everton,\" he says, referencing that spectacular overhead kick at Goodison Park.",
      "\"We have some very high potentials in this squad. And now we have to perform to high levels.",
      "\"We do it now in some games but on Sunday, for instance, we get an opposition who have a very high level. So that's a challenge to perform there and to get end product from those players on Sunday. So they are the next steps, which have to come.\"",
      "Ten Hag knows all about the power and momentum in-form young players can bring to a team. It was a driving force during his time at Ajax. It has also long been a foundation for success at United.",
      "Coupled with the experience of players such as Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, it can be a winning formula.",
      "\"They bring energy,\" says Ten Hag of his young players. \"I think it's always a combination of experience and high potentials. And when they respect each other, and they want to strengthen each other, then you have a team and that is always the objective because every player knows when there is a team you can achieve higher performances and higher levels and so achieve more.\"",
      "Another key ingredient, of course, is goals. And in Hojlund, United now have a striker who looks to have finally found his feet in the Premier League. There were a flurry of strikes in Europe earlier in this campaign but with four goals in his last four top-flight games, it feels like the big-money summer signing is now starting to deliver.",
      "That scoring streak began against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, when he hit a late winner in a comeback victory at Old Trafford. The relief and release of pressure when that ball found the net was plain to see in his celebration. But it is perhaps the consistency of selection in attack which has maintained his run of form.",
      "In each of United's last four Premier League games, they've had Marcus Rashford and Garnacho flanking the young Dane. The front three have a combined 10 goals and three assists in those matches - more than the 10 goal involvements they've registered between them in other Premier League games this season.",
      "\"Football is about co-operation,\" says Ten Hag. \"Finding the spaces by movements, by moving the ball and bringing players into positions where they can attack opponents or get into one-on-one situations. And then those players have the abilities to score goals.\"",
      "Finding familiar patterns and combinations across the pitch has been an issue for United and Ten Hag throughout this campaign because of a long list of injuries. Ten Hag celebrated the fact he could finally name his strongest XI for the first time this term against Wolves last week. A game later, he lost Lisandro Martinez to a knee injury.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" he says when asked if that has been the great frustration of this season. \"It stops the progress.",
      "\"Every time you have to adjust you don't have routines, you don't have partnerships and that is what we have seen.",
      "\"I think we have had nine different set-ups in the centre-half positions. In other positions we have to swap a lot and that was forced by injuries so we hope now we can keep a consistent team.\"",
      "United will certainly have to be at their best this weekend. Ten Hag describes the work of his counterpart at Aston Villa, Unai Emery, as \"incredible\", and the hosts will be eager to respond to their surprise FA Cup replay loss to Chelsea on Wednesday night. But this is the time when United need their stars - and rising stars - to step up.",

      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",
      "\"It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium.\"",
      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",

      "Saturday 10 February 2024 17:46, UK",
      "Goals at Luton, Darwin Nunez offsides, Morgan Gibbs-White to score and Enzo Fernandez shots are on Jones Knows' betting radar this weekend.",
      "Being wrong is part of this job. It comes with the territory. It was one of those very wrong weekends.",
      "Newcastle vs Luton to have 11 or more corners - there were 10 corners.",
      "Crystal Palace to avoid defeat at Brighton - they lost 4-1 having been 3-0 down at the break.",
      "And, finally, 50 or more booking points in Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. There was one booking in a non-event of a thrashing.",
      "Total wipe-out.",
      "It made me ponder how wrong would you rather be?",
      "When it comes to betting, your stake goes down the drain whether you are slightly wrong or very wrong.",
      "The overall result was just one point lost, the same as last weekend where we were just a Curtis Jones shot away from landing an 8/1 winner after landing two legs of the treble in what was some, gets my trumpet out, superb value seeking punting.",
      "BTTS & over 2.5 goals in Luton vs Sheffield Utd, Darwin Nunez to be caught offside 1+ times vs Burnley & Enzo Fernandez 2+ total shots vs Palace",
      "In theory it shouldn't matter how wrong you are but oh boy it does - purely for confidence reasons.",
      "I've never really understood why managers don't like rolling the dice in a game when 3-0 or 4-0 down. Surely risking a thrashing to try and get back into the game makes sense as it doesn't matter if you lose 10-2 or 4-0, it's only three points lost.",
      "But the psychological aspect is key isn't it.",
      "Even someone like me who has been punting, rather successfully, for a long time has been questioning my decision making when eyeing up some angles this week. It's like when a batsmen who is on a run of ducks thinks the ball fizzing his way is the size of a ping pong ball or when a striker runs through on goal and can only see the goalkeeper.",
      "The mind, eh? Such a powerful beast. We must stick to the process. Power through that variance.",
      "There are three bets to attack this weekend.",
      "Luton side are playing with a bravery and intensity that is taking the Premier League by storm and catching oppositions cold. Everyone seems to know their roles in their unique man-for-man pressing setup and their attackers are playing with great confidence in front of goal.",
      "Over their last five Premier League games there have been 24 goals scored, almost five goals per game while Sheffield United are averaging 4.57 goals in their matches across their last seven games. Draws really are no good for Sheffield United in their predicament, so I'm fully expecting a goal-heavy encounter.",
      "No Premier League player is averaging more offsides per 90 this season (1.27) than Darwin Nunez as his eagerness to break offside traps has seen him flagged offside 22 times in his last 15 starts. That included being caught by Burnley's trap twice in the reverse fixture in December. Vincent Kompany's team do like to play a high line - only five teams have caught more players offside more than this season than the Clarets (47).",
      "All this adds up to Nunez's offside probabilities looking very strong at the 10/11 with Sky Bet offered for one or more.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's raw average of 1.99 shots per 90 in the Premier League is enough on its own to make the 10/11 with Sky Bet on him having two or more shots an appealing wager but when you throw in the likely one-sided game-state vs Crystal Palace along with his increased confidence levels you've got yourself a blinding spot of value to attack.",
      "As hinted above, there is a clear trend developing that these types of games down at the bottom are producing more attacking intent than what the expected models are spitting out for the bookmaker lines. Of the 25 games involving both Sheffield United, Luton, Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford this season, the overall goal average has been 3.04 per game - above what has been expected by the market. And 40 per cent of those 25 games have seen four or more goals scored. The goal lines are worth attacking with the 9/2 on offer for five or more goals a sensible play considering all the evidence.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White ran amok playing in his preferred free role in the reverse fixture between Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, racking up an expected goals tally of 0.33 from his three shots at goal.",
      "I'm adamant we're dealing with a Champions League level player in time and his goalscorer prices remain hard to ignore with 13/2 anytime available with Sky Bet. He has scored twice since Nuno Espirito Santo took the reins and we have the added bonus of him being the likely penalty taker, which are being awarded at a rate of 0.29 per game this season meaning that 13/2 is a slice of value just on those grounds.",

      "The Radar column looks at the curious reluctance to praise Mikel Arteta's work at Arsenal and how Rasmus Hojlund has taken matters into his own hands to solve his scoring issues at Manchester United; plus: Tino Livramento's push for a Newcastle starting spot",
      "Sunday 11 February 2024 15:19, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta takes his Arsenal side to West Ham's London Stadium on Super Sunday on the back of a resounding victory over leaders Liverpool which reignited their Premier League title hopes.",
      "The underlying numbers highlighted Arsenal's superiority. Their total of 3.50 expected goals was the highest by any side against Liverpool on record. At the other end of the pitch, Jurgen Klopp's team were limited to only 0.37 expected goals, their lowest total of the season.",
      "It was an outstanding display, even factoring in the defensive lapse which allowed Liverpool back into the game on the stroke of half-time. But all that was rather lost in the fallout.",
      "Instead, the focus centred on the manner in which they enjoyed it. Arteta is not the first manager to celebrate a crucial goal by sprinting out of his technical area. Jurgen Klopp can testify to that. But rarely has the act provoked quite so much censure. At least not since the last time he did it.",
      "The obsession with Arteta's touchline behaviour fails to acknowledge the role of his emotional investment in improving the atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium. His intensity feeds into that of the crowd. Home advantage has been enhanced.",
      "Sunday's game was just the latest example. A once indifferent arena now crackles with anticipation for the biggest games. Connections have been forged. The mood has been transformed.",
      "If Arteta's perceived ill-discipline is somehow setting a bad example, it is not rubbing off on his players. They have received the fewest bookings in the Premier League this season having gone through the entirety of last term without a red card.",
      "More important than all that, though, is that Arteta has created a team capable of producing results like the one they celebrated on Sunday with increasing regularity.",
      "Arsenal have played six games against big-six opponents in the Premier League this season and not lost once. Manchester City, like Liverpool, left the Emirates defeated, having managed only 0.48 expected goals, a figure that remains their lowest of the season.",
      "Arteta has been healthily backed, of course. Both in terms of time and financial support. But Arsenal's re-emergence as contenders over the last 18 months owes more to him than any signing.",
      "The role of his coaching can be seen in the improvement of individuals across the squad. But it is even clearer in the collective. Arsenal have become the best side in the division defensively. Key performance indicators suggest they are up there offensively too.",
      "There remains a curious reluctance to praise his work. But this is what Arteta has created. A team rivalling the elite. A manager in his first job going toe to toe with two of the best in modern history in Pep Guardiola and Klopp. He deserves better than the trivial focus on how he and his players choose to celebrate.",
      "The goals are finally flowing for Rasmus Hojlund. Having not found the net once in his first 14 Premier League appearances, the striker, a £72m signing from Atalanta, now has four in four.",
      "His thrilling potential is shining through. It is a cause for celebration for Manchester United. But it would be hasty to say they have figured out how to get the best out of him. More accurate is that Hojlund has found ways of doing the job himself.",
      "Consider the fact that only one of his last five goals in all competitions, his late strike in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Newport County included, has been assisted by a team-mate.",
      "And even that goal, Sunday's opener against West Ham, was largely of Hojlund's own making as he collected Casemiro's interception with his back to goal before dummying his way past two defenders and brilliantly finding the bottom corner from the edge of the box.",
      "In total in the Premier League this season, a third of Hojlund's 24 shots have been unassisted. The same can be said for more than half of his 10 goals in all competitions. Without a reliable supply line, the Dane is having to generate his own chances.",
      "Wasteful finishing has been a factor too, of course. Hojlund missed nine big chances without scoring in the first half of the season, according to Opta. But the shot numbers are revealing.",
      "His average of 1.66 attempts per 90 minutes is the fifth-lowest of the 40 strikers to have played at least 400 minutes in the Premier League this season. Hojlund sits between Lyle Foster of Burnley and Sheffield United's Cameron Archer. It speaks to United's issues that their back-up striker, Anthony Martial, is even lower.",
      "Erik ten Hag spoke of improved service and better balance in United's front line after the win over West Ham, referencing the decision to switch Alejandro Garnacho to the right flank in recent games while restoring Marcus Rashford to the left.",
      "But the numbers show no tangible change to the number of chances Hojlund is getting. In fact, his four goals in four games since Boxing Day have come from only six shots, a total bettered by 73 players in the Premier League in the same timeframe.",
      "Across the four Premier League games in which Garnacho has started on the right with Rashford on the left, the pair have only found Hojlund with five and six passes respectively. He remains on the periphery, averaging only 26 touches per 90 minutes.",
      "Could it be that the responsibility lies with Hojlund himself? It seems unlikely given the quality of his movement. He ranks among the Premier League's top 10 players for attacking runs per 90 minutes and only slightly lower for runs challenging the opponent's backline.",
      "The problem is that United's wide forwards have other priorities. Rashford and Garnacho are averaging nearly twice as many shots as Hojlund. Given how infrequently they pass to him, it is hardly surprising they have only created six chances for him all season.",
      "It is to Hojlund's credit that he has found ways around the issue.",
      "Against Tottenham, a stunning finish slammed into the roof of the net after Rashford had been tackled while dribbling into his zone. Against FC Copenhagen, a rebound slotted home after Garnacho declined to square the ball to him for a simple finish.",
      "He is adapting, learning to rely on his own quality and intuition rather than the service of others. But for how much longer can he feast on scraps? Manchester United must find ways of feeding him properly if his recent scoring feats are to continue.",
      "Dan Burn will not remember his battle with Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene fondly. In fact, it is a probably a stretch to term it as such given its one-sidedness as Rob Edwards' side claimed a 4-4 draw.",
      "At £13m, the 31-year-old has been an excellent signing for Eddie Howe's side, adjusting from centre-back to full-back admirably and playing an important role in last season's Champions League finish.",
      "But as Newcastle continue to ship goals at an alarming rate - they have already conceded more this season than in the whole of last term - the case for Valentino Livramento to step in grows stronger.",
      "Left-back is not the 21-year-old's favoured position, of course. He is naturally right sided. But his substitute appearance against Luton, when he helped Newcastle recover to salvage a draw, was just the latest example of his capacity to play there.",
      "His drive gave Newcastle a new dimension in attack. At the other end, while Burn was dribbled past four times in 63 minutes, Livramento wasn't beaten once. He has in fact only been dribbled past nine times in 19 Premier League and Champions League appearances all season.",
      "His versatility is not lost on Howe, who has used him on both sides since his £40m arrival from Southampton in the summer. After Saturday's game, he described him as an \"outstanding player\" who will have a \"huge bearing\" on the club's future.",
      "But maybe the future is now. Against Nottingham Forest, live on Sky Sports on Saturday, Livramento will be ready and waiting to step in.",

      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:40, UK",
      "It is not even 20 years ago that Emirates Stadium and Wembley Stadium were best in class for stadium design in the UK and around the world.",
      "While both are still considered excellent venues for hosting top-class football and events, there is no hiding the advancements in stadium design in such a short space of time, with the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, and other new stadiums around the world.",
      "But are brand new stadiums the future?",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. Could those plans include the renovation of Old Trafford?",
      "Last summer, as part of Sky Sports' Future of Football series, with the help of the architects designing and the clubs building the stadiums, we took a look at some of the key developments in stadium design and what could be around the corner in stadiums of the future.",
      "Are Man Utd getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Renovation and refurbishment is certain to play a huge part in stadium design in the future.",
      "We are already seeing that in Spain. The renovation of one of the world's most famous football stadiums is well underway as the Espai Barca project sees Barcelona upgrade the Camp Nou and renovate 18 acres of the area surrounding the stadium.",
      "Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.",
      "Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind.",
      "He said: \"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums.",
      "\"I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.",
      "\"First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,\" he added. \"There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be.",
      "\"You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so.\"",
      "Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event.",
      "Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people.",
      "For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority.",
      "Lee said: \"From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives.",
      "\"From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect.",
      "\"We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings.",
      "\"Every stadium and every location is different,\" he added. \"But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect.",
      "\"If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US.",
      "\"Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes.\"",
      "There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities.",
      "The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community.",
      "An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces.",
      "The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time.",
      "\"When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,\" Lee said. \"They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes.",
      "\"I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities.",
      "\"In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators.",
      "\"A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities.\"",
      "Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities.",
      "He said: \"We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community.",
      "\"We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays.",
      "\"It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities.\"",
      "Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue.",
      "The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as \"the world's first timber stadium.\"",
      "Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",
      "\"The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,\" he said. \"Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else.",
      "\"There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero.",
      "\"The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,\" he added. \"For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles.",
      "\"When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain.",
      "\"It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too.",
      "\"I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\"",
      "For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium.",
      "Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: \"In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability.",
      "\"At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall.",
      "\"We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building.",
      "\"Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud.\"",
      "Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more \"relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community\" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round.",
      "Barbany said: \"There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow.",
      "\"There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona.",
      "\"If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique.",
      "\"Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday.",
      "\"On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend.",
      "\"You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is.",
      "\"This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project.\"",
      "Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:\n\n\n“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.\n“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.\n\n\n“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.\n\n\n“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.”",
      "Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a \"catalyst for the digital transformation of the club\", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution.",
      "With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes.",
      "\"Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there.",
      "\"All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home.\"",
      "We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom.",
      "So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design?",
      "Populous managing director Lee said: \"The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design.",
      "\"None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses.",
      "\"But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience.\"",
      "\"Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world.",
      "\"It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,\" he added.",
      "\"We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game.",
      "\"The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally.",
      "\"Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see.\"",
      "So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years? Virtual and augmented reality is a topic we looked at in further detail in our Future of Football series.",

      "Monday 5 February 2024 06:17, UK",
      "Rasmus Hojlund's fierce shot gave Erik ten Hag's team the lead in the first half, on the occasion of the striker's 21st birthday, before two second-half strikes by Garnacho took the game away from West Ham. Kalvin Phillips made another error for the third goal.",
      "West Ham had 20 shots and might have equalised just before Garnacho's first had Emerson Palmieri capitalised on an error by Harry Maguire on the England defender's return to the team. But David Moyes' men were not clinical and their opponents were.",
      "The result sees Manchester United leapfrog West Ham into sixth spot and build on the momentum of their late winner at Wolves on Thursday evening. It is five unbeaten in all competitions now. Momentum might just be building at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd: Onana (6), Dalot (7), Maguire (5), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (6), Garnacho (8), Hojlund (7), Rashford (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nSubs: McTominay (6), Varane (6), Antony (n/a), Lindelof (n/a).\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Ham: Areola (6), Coufal (6), Johnson (7), Zouma (6), Aguerd (6), Emerson (5), Soucek (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Alvarez (6), Kudus (7), Bowen (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nSubs: Fabianski (6), Phillips (5), Cornet (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "On the weekend that Old Trafford paid tribute to those who lost their lives in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6 1958, Manchester United were looking to build on their midweek win over Wolves but Moyes' West Ham side made for testing opponents.",
      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",
      "But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed.",
      "Manchester United have had false dawns before and this was far from a totally dominant display. But, with key players back from injury, two wins in four days have begun to change the complexion of their Premier League season. Upwardly mobile once more?",
      "Ten Hag revealed afterwards the knee injury to Martinez is \"a personal disaster\" for the player. \"I can't say but it doesn't look good,\" said the United boss when speaking in the press conference. \"There is a bad concern. We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis.",
      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "West Ham boss Moyes also said Martinez made \"a huge difference\" for Manchester United. \"He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play. I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable.\"",
      "Moyes even highlighted Martinez's role in a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Maguire. The Argentina international was able to force Emerson wide. \"I think he was a bit spooked by Martinez.\"",
      "Manchester United visit Aston Villa in the Premier League, live on Super Sunday; kick-off 4.30pm. West Ham host Arsenal on the same day, also live on Sky Sports; kick-off 2pm.",

      "Plus: Lack of belief costs West Ham at Man Utd; Nottingham Forest show signs that they can get themselves out of Premier League relegation trouble after draw at Bournemouth",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 13:55, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"
