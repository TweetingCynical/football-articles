      "Emi Martinez’s wife has denied that her husband has said farewell to Aston Villa. A visibly emotional Martinez was seen waving to supporters following Villa’s final home game of the 2024/25 campaign against Tottenham on May 16, prompting speculation he could leave this summer.",
      "The Argentina international has a contract at Villa until 2029, but their failure to qualify for the Champions League could prompt him to go elsewhere. There have been reports about Villa’s concerns with complying with the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, suggesting the club might need to cash in on their top players.",
      "Martinez has been linked with a move to Manchester United, who first made contact in January amid worries over Andre Onana. Villa were then said to be keeping an eye on Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia as a potential replacement for Martinez.",
      "But his wife Mandinha has dismissed the speculation, telling BBC WM: \"He wasn't in tears. No. Anybody who knows Emi knows he is an emotional character and that's who he is. It just shows you how much he loves the Villa fans. I love the Villa fans. We love Villa.\"",
      "Her words may reassure Villa supporters somewhat, but Martinez himself has been a lot less committed in public.",
      "SSpeaking to reporters after reporting for international duty recently, he said: \"My future? I don’t know, I come here to play for the national team, and that’s the only thing that matters to me right now.",
      "\"Do I want to move to a new club? The transfer window just opened, so there’s still a long way to go.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Villa boss Unai Emery has also hinted that Martinez will be on his way this summer. Speaking before the final game of the season against United on May 25 – in which Martinez was sent off – he said: \"We will see. Of course, it is the last match here [this season], and I don't know.",
      "“We will see about the team, the players, but of course, they are responding on the field. Of course, then we will see about everything, how we are going to try to get better for the next season.\"",
      "\"I’ve still got friends here. I came here as a lad and left a man. I’ll always love this club.",
      "\"They are still second, they’ve come far and have one of the best managers in the world. I’ve worked with Mikel [Arteta]. I know how good he is.\"",

      "Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has claimed that blackmail and threats will not force him to agree to a transfer for Viktor Gyokeres. It has been said that the forward is willing to go on strike after he believed the club had went back on their word over the fee they were willing to accept for a move.",
      "Gyokeres has drawn interest from across Europe and the Saudi Pro League, with Arsenal and Manchester United among contenders for his signature. The 27-year-old is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.",
      "But Varandas has denied he agreed to allow Gyokeres to leave if an offer reaching £60million arrived for the Swedish striker. And the president has suggested there has yet to be an offer on the table for his prize asset, despite him hitting more than 50 goals last term.",
      "\"One thing you should already know is me better,\" said Varandas, per Record. \"Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Gyokeres' fury is said to stem from his belief that the Portuguese giants are demanding £67m, a figure almost £10m more than he expected. While Varandas accepted the club will not demand the player's release clause be activated, he attempted to explain what he considers the truth of the agreement made with Gyokeres' agent.",
      "New Manchester City director of football Hugo Viana played a crucial role, while he was still with Sporting, before Varandas was required to enter negotiations.",
      "\"I think it's fair to explain the whole process. The process started last year when the season ended, Sporting were champions and had a fantastic season,\" Varandas explained.",
      "\"During the transfer window we realised that Viktor was going to stay at Sporting because we didn't receive a single offer for him. When the season started, the agent approached Hugo Viana several times, asking if we could add an extra fee to the contract if he scored 'x' goals; I gave Viana the opportunity to negotiate, within reason.",
      "\"Viana manages the relationship with the agents, and very well, this is done by the sporting director. One of the agent's biggest concerns was whether we would demand the value of the €100m (£85m) clause next year.",
      "\"Viana negotiated with the agents over several meetings, until the agent himself asked for the president's presence to settle the matter once and for all. The issue of the bonus for 'x' goals seemed reasonable and at that meeting, where the president, the agent and Viana were present, no player was present, Viktor was not present, the agent wanted to guarantee certain things.\"",
      "\"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27. Then, we knew Viktor's dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "\"We guaranteed that we would not demand €100m. In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of €60m, €70m... And I said 'there's no point in setting a value because I don't know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season... There's no point in setting a value, I don't know if it will be €40m, €60m or €80m (£34, £51 or £68m). What I can guarantee is that I will not demand €100m'.",
      "\"From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. 10 months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word. The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\"",

      "The 27-year-old sharpshooter helped Sporting to a league and cup double after scoring 54 goals in 52 appearances in 2024/25. Gyokeres has developed an impressive reputation after moving to Lisbon from Coventry City.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim that Gyokeres has been left furious having already insisted he would depart the club this summer and will not play for the side again. Player and club had an agreement that Gyokeres would be allowed to leave for significantly less than his release clause.",
      "It appears Sporting have honoured that but they are now demanding more than the £50million plus £8.4m in add-ons Gyokeres expected. Record report the club have instead demanded £67m.",
      "The ex-Brighton ace has already turned down the prospect of a move to Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal saw a £55m offer rejected but Gyokeres has rebuffed an annual salary of £30m as he wants to continue to compete in Europe.",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal are among the sides linked with making a move for Gyokeres. The Gunners are the star forward's preference if he gets his pick of teams this summer.",
      "Sporting believe that Gyokeres' inclination would be to pick Arsenal and the Premier League over interest from Spain and Italy. A move to United meanwhile would see a reunion with Ruben Amorim with the Red Devils intent on bolstering their forward line having already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",

      "The playmaker scored 14 goals and registered 11 assists for Oliver Glasner’s side, including netting the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City to hand the Eagles their first-ever major trophy. That impressive form has seen the England international linked with rival Premier League clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And during England’s 3-1 defeat to Senegal on Tuesday, where Eze played the full 90 minutes, United hero Scholes saw enough evidence to believe he would thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "Taking to Instagram during the game, Scholes posted a picture of Eze in an England shirt with a three-word transfer plea, telling United bosses to: “Just buy him.”",
      "Eze reportedly has a £68m release clause in his Palace contract, which can be activated this summer. Speaking last month, Scholes’ former Red Devils team-mate, Dwight Yorke, also urged United to make a move for the player.",
      "“Eberechi Eze at Crystal Palace would be perfect for Manchester United,\" Yorke said. “Yeah, he scored at the weekend in the FA Cup final, but it’s not just about that. A year ago, maybe more, I said this kid and Michael Olise – who went to Bayern – United should buy them for £100 million.",
      "“Put £100m down and you will get two fantastic players. Instead, they listened to the figures in the hierarchy, which is understandable, but it’s glaring just how good these two are.",
      "“Eze has the decision-making, the talent, he’s a good athlete, he can create and score. He’s at the right age to step up and play on a bigger platform. It’s a no-brainer.”",
      "Former QPR talent Eze was outstanding again for England this week despite a woeful overall team performance. He stood out in a central role, winning the ball back from Lamine Camara in the lead-up to England’s opening goal.",
      "But he truly came alive after the hour mark, combining excellently with substitutes Morgan Gibbs-White and Morgan Rogers by being at the heart of England’s best period of the game.",
      "Despite excelling in a No. 10 role, Eze would likely play just behind the striker in Ruben Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1 formation if United manage to sign him. Any such deal could also see him partner up with the likes of Bruno Fernandes and new signing Matheus Cunha to form an exciting new front three.",
      "United are, however, prioritising the signing of a new striker and appear to be settled on going for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo over the likes of other attack-minded midfielders like Eze after it was revealed that Fernandes would stay at the club this summer.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is believed to be their number one target, though United have also been linked with Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko to a lesser extent.",

      "There will be key decisions to make over a number of players with the future of captain Son Heung-min a hot topic. But Tottenham technical director Johan Lange will be the figure heading up much of the recruitment, possibly alongside a returning Fabio Paratici.",
      "With a return to Champions League football to manage in addition to the battles of the Premier League, the pressure will be on Frank to deliver on both fronts. And perhaps a new player or two can help boost Spurs' numbers and quality ahead of a better season.",

      "The Spurs backline will see Kevin Danso make his loan move permanent this summer after arriving amidst the club's injury nightmare midway through the season. Already there is some competition with talented stars such as Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Radu Dragusin at Frank's disposal.",

The latter could help provide a base alongside Sarr if Spurs plan to stick with the players they have.",

      "Gyokeres scored more than 50 goals last term and has been tipped to reunite with Amorim in Manchester after the Portuguese boss swapped Lisbon for Old Trafford midway through the campaign.",
      "United are looking to bolster their forward line and Gyokeres would be able to supply goals on a regular basis. His career has skyrocketed since he left Championship side Coventry City. Grennan is a fan of the Sky Blues and remains good pals with their former striker.",
      "He said on the BBC podcast You About?: \"I know him well. I actually messaged him and he said that there's different conversations going on. Do you know who his best friend is? Haaland. That is why I think he'll go to Manchester United because he'll be next door to Haaland.\"",
      "Haaland has been hugely impressive and successful during his three years in England. He's just missed out on the Premier League title for the first time but has broken numerous records since swapping Borussia Dortmund for Manchester City.",
      "Those on the blue half of Manchester remain the city's dominant force and finished some 29 points ahead of United. Amorim is tasked with making the Red Devils a winning-outfit once more and adding Gyokeres would help their chances and the striker has an agreement to leave the club.",
      "However it is understood that Gyokeres has been left fuming with Sporting after they demanded more for him than they promised as he looks for a way out of the Portuguese club. The Lisbon outfit have been demanding £67million for him. Previously they agreed that they would demand £50m plus £8.4m in add-ons this summer - meaning they asked for almost £10m more, reports Record.",
      "The Swede recently addressed his future and said: “Let us see. It’s hard for me to say, because yeah it is football and you never know what’s going to happen in the summer. So for me to say anything else than that is impossible.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "That means Trent Alexander-Arnold is available for Real Madrid, with Liverpool earning £10m by allowing him to go a month before the end of his contract at Anfield, Liam Delap can play for Chelsea after arriving from Ipswich Town and Rayan Ait Nouri will feature for Manchester City following his signing from Wolves.",
      "Other teams have availed of the early start too with Liverpool completing a move for Jeremie Frimpong and Manchester United landing Matheus Cunha.",

      "But there is one other twist - deadline day will come to an end at 7pm rather than the 11pm everyone has become accustomed to for several years.",

New boss Ruben Amorim was unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford after taking over from Erik ten Hag in November, guiding the club to a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League standings.",
      "While the Red Devils looked to save an otherwise catastrophic campaign via better performances in Europe, a 1-0 loss to a similarly struggling Tottenham Hotspur in last month's Europa League final only served as further embarrassment for the once-titans of English football.",
      "\"The two clubs together are so far down the league. Spurs have obviously been decimated with injuries. It's been really, really difficult for them.",
      "\"Their style of play, on their day when it clicks, they're a really, really good team. You can see what their DNA is, but Man Utd, on the other hand, I'm still yet to be convinced of what their actual DNA is. I don't see any change from a couple of things, but in general it's been really, really poor for them.\"",
      "Dallas also pondered whether a Europa League title was enough to argue that Spurs have had a successful season, given that the Lilywhites finished two places lower than United in the Premier League standings. He added: \"It's mad to think that they were both European finalists as well and Spurs have obviously come out on top.",
      "\"I don't know, is it a successful season for Tottenham? They've won the European Cup and they've got Champions League football. It's bragging rights over Arsenal.",
      "\"Arsenal have obviously had a fantastic season. They've come second, but they haven't won a Cup and they're in the Champions League. Spurs have won a Cup and are in the Champions League.\"",
      "Spurs are currently on the hunt for a new manager in the wake of parting ways with Ange Postecoglou earlier this month, with Brentford boss Thomas Frank looking increasingly likely to take tenure at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for 2025/26. Manchester United, meanwhile, are currently undergoing major revamps to their current squad with hopes that a summer transfer window and a full pre-season campaign can be a game-changer for Amorim.",

      "A crossroads stands before Manchester United in their hunt to sign Brentford talisman Bryan Mbeumo this summer. And with transfer funds not exactly flowing at Old Trafford right now, it could prove definitive for their other investments in the coming months.",
      "United's opening offer of £55million for the player was reportedly turned down by Brentford. And though another bid is believed to be imminent, Ruben Amorim's side would do well to take stock of their options before launching a follow-up.",
      "Despite finishing at an all-time low of 15th in the Premier League and failing to qualify for Europe next term, United at least have some cards in their hand. That's after The Athletic reported Mbeumo, who was keen to join a Champions League club, now has his heart set on a move to Old Trafford despite interest from the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle.",
      "That U-turn, after both those clubs were linked with Mbeumo in January, tilts the transfer battle in United's favour. Tottenham have also been mooted as a suitor amid talks that Thomas Frank is set to take over in north London, though murmurs suggest Mbeumo values the United cause above Spurs' upcoming European adventure.",
      "It's a similar sequence of events that saw Amorim land Wolves talisman Matheus Cunha in such swift fashion. The Brazil international was keen to play for United above all else next term, underlining United still have serious pulling power despite their absence from European competition next season.",
      "It's believed the Bees are seeking upwards of £60m to part ways with their player, an almighty fee considering United already shelled out £62.5m for Cunha. But if the Red Devils want their man they may just have to suck it up.",
      "Man United's second option is to finance the deal by parting ways with Alejandro Garnacho, which many might deem an inevitability already this summer.",
      "Argentinian newspaper Ole has suggested AC Milan have opened talks to sign Garnacho and are seeking a deal worth £50m. That's £15m short of United's supposed valuation of the player, though it may be enough to convince them, considering Amorim's difficult relationship with the 20-year-old.",
      "That sum also wouldn't quite cover the outlay required to recruit Mbeumo, who would come at a higher cost to the wage bill. However, it's a convenient route to offloading one troublesome asset while signing what would effectively be his replacement.",
      "Except Mbeumo plays almost exclusively on the right wing, while the majority of Garnacho's minutes are spent more centrally and on the left flank. It also poses the question as to what lies in store for Cunha and whether he's intended to start up front, behind the striker or out wide.",
      "Amad Diallo has just started coming into his own under Amorim, and he too operates almost solely off the right. After several years of overcoming injuries, managerial changes and loan spells away from Old Trafford, it would be a shame to see the 22-year-old's progress halted now.",
      "Yet United are in dire need of results now and can ill afford to bid their time on the hope of what may come down the line. In that sense, Mbeumo would be a proven Premier League upgrade based on what's been seen of the player in recent seasons.",
      "The Cameroon international finished this season with 20 goals and eight assists and appeared in each of Brentford's 38 league games. But he wouldn't be the first big investment to impress elsewhere before falling flat under the increased pressure at United.",
      "The Red Devils will be expected to fork out a heavy sum regardless of how Mbeumo arrives at the club. But the manner in which they balance the books could play a major role in how far the club can afford to invest elsewhere this summer."

      "Garnacho offers a prime chance for United to bring in a profitable fee and to provide a boost to the team's outlook under profit and sustainability rules as a result of coming through the club's academy after signing from Atletico Madrid as a 16-year-old. The winger has been told to find a new club by boss Ruben Amorim.",

      "Ruben Amorim's squad will be given a significant makeover in the summer transfer window.",
      "Manchester United announced the signing of Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the window and they are hoping Bryan Mbeumo will be the second fresh face through the door.",
      "United triggered to £62.5million release clause in Cunha's contract at Wolves, which will be paid over three instalments, and a similar fee will be needed to persuade Brentford to allow Mbeumo to leave.",
      "Ruben Amorim does not have a warchest to play with, but Cunha and Mbuemo would take the summer spending to more than £120m and player sales will be important to offset incomings.",
      "It's no secret that United need to sell players this summer and, conveniently, there are three players who have decent resale value at the front of the queue to exit Old Trafford.",
      "The first of those is Marcus Rashford, who will be available for £40m. Rashford missed the end of the season at Aston Villa with a hamstring injury, but he showed enough during his temporary stint at Villa Park for a club to take a chance on him - Barcelona have been heavily linked - this summer.",
      "Rashford's sale will be considered as pure profit in the books. His departure will be key for the transfer budget, although shifting Antony and Jadon Sancho is also high on the agenda.",
      "Sancho will not be joining Chelsea on a permanent transfer, which means the Blues will now pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break the agreement they signed last summer.",
      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "It also means a new buyer must come to the table for Sancho. There have been murmurs of interest from Turkey and United will hope they can bank £20m minimum for the winger.",
      "Antony could be remembered as the worst Premier League signing ever, but he was tremendous during his Real Betis loan and the Spanish club would like to sign him permanently.",
      "The Brazilian must be sold for £32.5m to avoid a PSR loss on his transfer from Ajax, but that would make him Real Betis' record transfer and they probably don't have that capital to spend.",
      "Again, that means United need to find a new willing buyer for Antony this summer, but his stock has improved due to his hugely successful loan stint and £32.5m feels like a fair valuation.",
      "The fourth sale up Amorim's sleeve is Alejandro Garnacho, who was informed he could find a new club this summer after a private breakdown with United's coach at the end of the campaign.",
      "Napoli and Chelsea were interested in signing Garnacho in the January transfer window. The fee of £40m was talked up, but United should be holding out for at least £50m for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho has proven himself in the Premier League, he is an Argentine international and has not reached his ceiling. He is worth £50m because of the untapped potential he possesses.",
      "Amorim was asked if Garnacho had played his final game for the club after the win over Aston Villa and said: \"Garnacho is one more player of Manchester United, so I don't know what is going to happen in the future. He is a normal player.\"",
      "United's head coach added: \"Garnacho is a Manchester United player who was not in the squad today, but he is a normal player in our club and I have no news that will change [that].\"",
      "Amorim has handled Garnacho intelligently in public to protect his transfer value, giving him minutes on the post-season tour, but the 20-year-old is expected to have played his final game for the club. The combined sales of that quartet would total 142.5m."

      "The summer transfer window temporarily closed on Tuesday evening and will not reopen until next Monday, meaning no activity will take place in M16 over the next few days.",
      "However, United are understood to remain in discussions with Brentford about attempting to sign Mbeumo. They are expected to table a fresh bid after their opening offer of £55million was knocked back last week.",
      "If United successfully add Mbeumo to their attack, it would mark a second statement signing of the summer following the addition of Cunha on June 1. He arrived in Manchester after United triggered his £62.5m release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "With United set to focus on attempting to wrap up the signing of Mbeumo once the window reopens next week, they will then have to switch their focus to outgoings to fund further additions. United want to strengthen a handful of other areas ahead of next season.",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at what United's strongest matchday squad could look like come the end of the window.",
      "Despite wanting a new goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, the Cameroonian is still likely to retain top spot in the pecking order and start next season as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir is likely to leave and Amorim will want an upgrade on him to provide competition for Onana.",
      "As far as the back-three is concerned, Amorim, once everyone is fit, will be spoilt for choice. United are well-stocked at centre-back and every member of that department will believe they are worthy of starting, meaning pre-season performances could dictate who gets the nod in August.",
      "Currently, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, who both have bright futures ahead of them, are the most likely options to start in the two wide centre-back roles, meaning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt will compete to start in between them.",
      "If United sign Mbeumo, Amad is an obvious pick at right wing-back. The Ivorian was a rare bright spark in 2024/25 and should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "In the opposite wing-back berth, Patrick Dorgu is currently a shoo-in after arriving from Lecce earlier this year. He will only get better with time and games.",
      "In the centre of midfield, Bruno Fernandes is an obvious starter. He is highly likely to occupy one of the two No.8 positions amid Cunha's arrival and the expectation he will operate from the left-sided No.10 position.",
      "However, there is an element of uncertainty surrounding who could occupy the midfield spot next to him. United want to sign a new midfielder this summer, but they are yet to have identified a firm target, with outgoings set to determine how big a budget they have.",
      "As things stand, Manuel Ugarte is the most obvious candidate to operate next to Fernandes. He will be able to do the dirty side of the game, allowing the United skipper to advance into forward areas.",
      "As far as the two No.10 positions are concerned, they should be occupied by Mbeumo and Cunha. The latter is a specialist in his role and Mbeumo has the versatility to adapt having predominantly played as a right-winger at Brentford.",
      "The biggest void in need of filling in United's starting XI, of course, is at No.9. They are desperate for a striker and have been forced to alter their plans after missing out on Liam Delap.",
      "Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres would be the dream signing for most United supporters amid his outstanding goalscoring record in Portugal and his relationship with Amorim. He ticks several boxes and would bring a proven goalscoring record to Old Trafford.",
      "However, United's chances of signing him will once again rest on outgoings and generating funds via sales. United do have a collection of players they want to move on.",
      "With United targeting a new goalkeeper to compete with Onana, they could do worse than targeting Leicester City shot-stopper Mads Hermansen following their relegation to the Championship. Their financial difficulties could mean they may have to sanction a cut-price deal.",
      "Defensive cover could be provided by Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and one of Maguire or De Ligt. United are also reasonably well-stocked in midfield, meaning cover could come from Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi could offer attacking cover. Rasmus Hojlund would be an option for the bench if retained.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha, Gyokeres.",

      "In total, the forward scored 121 goals in 275 appearances for the Reds before leaving to join Blackburn Rovers in 2002. Cole retired from the professional game in November 2008 after a stint at Nottingham Forest and has gone on to work as a coach and pundit.",
      "The 53-year-old has also endured health problems since hanging up his boots, and in 2015, he suffered kidney failure. In 2017, he underwent a kidney transplant.",
      "And Cole has shared an update on Wednesday about his health to his Instagram followers, with several emotional posts.",
      "\"Process.. the journey continues,\" he said in the first post alongside a picture of the hospital ward he attended. \"Tired body in pain... we continue to understand kidney disease is draining at times... but we keep smiling as it's part of the process.\"",
      "In the second post, he shared a picture of his medication and said: \" Keep me going for the next 3 months quitting never an option with the good days we work with the bad days.\"",
      "Back in 2018, Cole shared the personal story of how he owes his sister’s son a ‘lifelong debt’ after a terrifying brush with death. The former footballer had struggled with illness for two years before his nephew, Alexander Palmer, was found to be the perfect match for a transplant in 2017.",
      "During the emotional interview, Andy said: “My family all rallied round to offer to be donors, my sisters and nephews, and that meant I had a donor quickly.",

      "Manchester United have been among the busier clubs in the early stages of the summer, with a deal for Matheus Cunha already wrapped up.",
      "It’s also been widely reported that the Red Devils are pushing to secure a move for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, having received an indication from the player that he’s keen on a switch to Old Trafford. That would be a major boost for Ruben Amorim’s side, who missed out on European football following a disappointing Premier League campaign and a Europa League final defeat.",
      "However, United may not stop there, as they continue to be linked with further attacking reinforcements amid ongoing uncertainty over the futures of Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho. Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, who worked under Amorim in Portugal, is another name repeatedly mentioned as a potential target this summer.",
      "Here, MEN Sport rounds up the latest news and speculation surrounding Gyokeres’ future and the possibility of a transfer to United...",
      "Gyokeres’ departure from Sporting is unlikely to be a straightforward saga, with reports of a dispute over the expected transfer fee emerging in recent days. The Sweden international is said to be furious with the club after they allegedly reneged on a gentleman’s agreement to allow him to leave for a reasonable fee this summer, having stayed for an additional season in Portugal.",
      "According to the latest from Portuguese outlet Record, the 27-year-old has informed Sporting that he will not play for them again and has no intention of returning for pre-season. The report also claims he is prepared to cut his holiday short in order to speak publicly on the matter, feeling he has been disrespected.",
      "Despite having a €100 million release clause in his contract, Gyokeres’ representatives believe there was an understanding he could leave for around €60 million this summer. Record now suggest Sporting are using the rising interest in the striker to drive up the asking price.",
      "United have long been linked with Gyokeres, who scored a remarkable 54 goals across all competitions last season. Record report that Arsenal are also in the mix and were once considered favourites to sign him, though that may have shifted in recent weeks as they appear to be stepping up their pursuit of RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Juventus and Al-Hilal have also been credited with interest. The Saudi side’s involvement is particularly notable, having recently missed out on a mega move for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gyokeres prefers a move within Europe, where he could continue to compete for major honours.",
      "Gyokeres remains close friends with musician Tom Grennan from his time in England at Championship side Coventry City.",
      "Speaking on the BBC podcast 'You About?', Grennan shared his thoughts on where the striker could end up this summer: \"I know him well. I actually messaged him and he said that there's different conversations going on.",
      "\"Do you know who his best friend is? Haaland. That is why I think he'll go to Manchester United because he'll be next door to Haaland.\""

      "Ralf Rangnick was not even associated with Manchester United yet and he was able to successfully identify their problems without being privy to inside information.",
      "It was August 2019 and in a wide-ranging interview, the German did his best to summarise where United had wrong since legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson had retired.",
      "He told The Times: \"Since Sir Alex left they were underperforming. They haven't won the title since he left. At any club, if you cannot get the right players, then you should at least not sign the wrong ones.",
      "\"You are in trouble if you do that in one or two or three consecutive transfer windows. Club building is about building the right squad by transferring the right players away and having more than 50 per cent success rate of bringing in the right players.",
      "\"Then you must have the best possible coaches to develop these players.\"",
      "Once Rangnick had got his feet under the table at Old Trafford in November 2021 after being installed as interim manager, he was able to analyse United's problems up close. His press conferences were more memorable than the football.",
      "\"You don't even need glasses to see and analyse where the problems are,\" he said in April 2022. \"Now it's about how do we solve them?",
      "\"It's not enough to do some minor amendments – cosmetic things. In medicine you would say that this is an operation of the open heart.",
      "\"If this happens and everyone has realised that this has to happen and if people want to work together then it makes sense and I believe it doesn't take two or three years to change those things. This can happen within one year.\"",
      "United's recruitment strategy over the past decade has attracted plenty of criticism. They have paid over the odds for countless players and have often allowed players to run down their contracts and leave for free when they could have been sold for a fee. Jesse Lingard is a prime example of that particular failing.",
      "However, after Ineos secured a minority stake at the start of 2024, United's recruitment strategy has improved. They were proactive in the seller's market last summer, cashing in on players who did not have long-term futures at the club.",
      "Most of those who left were sold in deals that included sell-on clauses or buy-back clauses. It represented a step in the right direction after years of mismanagement and misunderstanding of the market.",
      "For all of Ineos' faults, United's recruitment policy has improved under their stewardship. They are looking to offload a number of big-name players this summer.",
      "United want to cash-in on Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. United value the trio at somewhere in the region of a collective £97.5million.",
      "With United now operating with a winger-less system, there is no sense in retaining players who do not fit head coach Ruben Amorim's formation. In the past, you would have been unable to guarantee United would be so sensible.",
      "Showing ambition to get the aforementioned trio off the books, United are in the process of moulding the squad to Amorim's needs. He has already been allowed to sign a specialist operator for his system in Matheus Cunha and he now wants to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "In those two, should Mbeumo sign, United will have secured the services of ready-made Premier League players. In the past, their recruitment has not been anywhere near as sensible.",
      "In offloading players at the right juncture, they are freeing up space and generating funds to modernise the squad and evolve it. There comes a certain point where clubs have to oversee major rebuilds and United have been in need of one for years.",
      "This summer, however, feels as though it will come to fruition. They have started the window on the front foot and every decision they have made so far has been positive.",
      "In offloading players at the right time, United are giving themselves the best possible chance of bringing the right ones in. They may be halfway towards proving Rangnick's assessment right."

      "However, the it will reopen again as soon as Monday (June 16), meaning clubs will once again be free to press ahead with their recruitment plans ahead of the 2025/26 campaign. The window will not close until September 1.",
      "United saw an opening offer of £55million for Mbeumo knocked back last week. They offered £45m up front and a further £10m in add-ons.",
      "Despite falling short of Brentford's valuation, United have remained in talks with the Londoners and are expected to make an improved offer for the Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals in the most recent campaign. The Reds would like to get a deal for Mbeumo over the line before the start of pre-season training in July.",
      "If United get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old, he will join Matheus Cunha in strengthening their attacking options. He recently arrived from Wolves after United trigged his £62.5m release clause.",
      "As well as wanting to sign Mbeumo, United also have ambitions of signing a striker, a midfielder and potentially a goalkeeper. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also yet to have been ruled out.",

      "Once it reopens for a second time, clubs will have a longer window to complete player transfers, with the deadline set for September 1. So far, United have completed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million.",
      "The Brazilian, who is currently on international duty, will join his new teammates when he returns to England.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are alert to Gyokeres' situation in Lisbon. The Italian newspaper have described the Swede as their 'new, magnificent and tempting obsession'.",
      "They are reportedly 'acting to close a deal' as they try to take advantage of all the noise between the striker and Sporting. The Portuguese giants are thought to have increased his transfer value from £50million to £67.7m - a decision that left Gyokeres 'angered.'",
      "However, it's said that striking a deal would not be 'straightforward' but it would send a 'powerful signal' to their rivals in Serie A.",
      "MEN Sport says: It's no surprise, to say the least, to see reports linking Juventus with Gyokeres. His performances over the past two seasons fully justify the level of interest he’s attracting this summer. United likely anticipated facing competition for the Swede.",
      "There have been claims that Gyokeres is keen to leave Sporting this window to take the next step in his career - and that next step would almost certainly involve Champions League football. Juventus can offer him exactly that. But with several clubs in the race, this saga is far from over.",

When it comes to Antony, the decision should be straightforward. Unfortunately, his time at Old Trafford simply hasn’t worked out.",
      "Despite the significant investment made to bring him in, the Brazilian winger has failed to deliver consistent performances or justify £86m price tag. With United needing to balance their books and reinvest in strengthening key areas of the squad, offloading Antony on a permanent basis should be a priority. A sale would not only help the club comply with PSR, but also create room for fresh, more effective options in the wide areas."

Early transfer activity like the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and the ongoing pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo will go some way to improving the team's attacking threat.",
      "Napoli's Victor Osimhen, who will return from a year-long loan to Turkish Super Lig side Galatasaray this summer, could be that final piece of the puzzle. The Nigeria international was very impressive as he helped Napoli to the Serie A title two years ago and dominated the Turkish league in the past season.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres could be reunited with Amorim instead and he's been a talisman for his side since his move from Coventry City in the Championship. He's scored more league goals than he's played league games for Sporting, and if he could replicate anything close to that in the Premier League, it would go a long way to putting United back among the top of the table.",
      "Either would require a significant outlay and with United already committing over £100 million to Cunha and Mbeumo, some good sales would have to be made.",
      "The fans are torn on who would help restore the faith in United's attack. Reader RED DEVIL says: \"Osimhen may be a good signing for United, we certainly need a proven centre forward. We live in hope.\"",
      "Commenter Wiserds writes: \"Viktor Gyokeres worries me given his English experience extends to Coventry City. Of course he could be a success, but why did no Premier League (team) identify him prior to going to Sporting?",
      "\"Victor Osimhen is also a worry, but that is more about his attitude and reputation for not necessarily fitting well into a dressing room. United have had enough of this type of individual and working hard to get rid of them. Do they need to recruit one? I guess all signings are a gamble!\"",

Pacey, powerful, good with his feet, good in the air and capable of turning a centre back. Of all the options out there, getting him must be the least risk, and frankly if he can't score for United then there is most likely something very wrong elsewhere in the side.\"",

      "After their Nations League semi-final against Germany, Fernandes spoke to Sky Italia about Leao. \"I met him as a kid at Sporting; he came up to the first team with me,\" the United captain said.",

      "In truth, the jump from being a starting striker at Atalanta to being a starting striker at United was just too big for the Dane at such a young age. With the exception of the injury-prone Anthony Martial, Hojlund did not have anyone he could lean on for guidance or support.",
      "Despite that, he plundered a respectable 16 goals in his maiden season in England, and there was hope he would build on that tally in 2024/25. However, his performances regressed and he scored just ten goals, of which only four were netted in the Premier League.",
      "It further highlighted the feeling that Hojlund should have been signed to perform the role of United's secondary striker. Martial's injury record meant the Denmark international immediately had to step up and shoulder United's goalscoring burden.",

United are prepared to sell any player this summer and the striker is one of the more likely candidates to be moved on to raise funds for new additions.",

      "It is a striker of that ilk that United need to be signing this summer, as opposed to another striker in the bracket of Hojlund, who was recruited based on potential.",
      "Keane was right that Hojlund should have been signed to provide competition and not be the frontman of United's attack. This summer it feels almost inevitable that United will go down the right route when trying to bring in a No.9."

But the main transfer window opens next week and will run until September 1, when it will close at the earlier time of 7pm rather than the more traditional 11pm. The Premier League have brought the deadline forward by four hours to help provide a better work-life balance to staff employed in football.",

      "The Reds are confident of landing Mbeumo this summer but missed out on Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap. The 22-year-old had a release clause of £30million following the Tractor Boys' relegation to the Championship but he has opted to join Chelsea.",
      "United have been keen to strengthen their frontline after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee scored just 17 goals between them in all competitions last term.",
      "United could also sign a new goalkeeper, a right wing-back and a midfielder, depending on outgoings. Alejandro Garnacho will likely depart Old Trafford this summer while United will try and offload Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho after the trio returned from loan spells.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season and won't play European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham."

      "Currently, Jadon Sancho represents a problem for Manchester United after the winger returned, cap in hand, to Old Trafford.",
      "In an ideal world, the Reds would have sold Sancho to Chelsea this summer for the £25m fee which was agreed between the two clubs last year. However, after an underwhelming season at Stamford Bridge and unsuccessful talks with Enzo Maresca's recruitment team, a permanent move could not be sanctioned.",
      "While United have managed to bag themselves a £5m penalty payment from the Blues, this will only be a drop in the ocean if they do not find another suitor for him. Fortunately, Sancho's stock does still remain high in certain corners of Europe.",
      "From United's perspective, it is easy to see why they would be interested in getting that deal done as soon as possible. The quicker they can get a fee bagged for Sancho, the sooner they will be able to progress with moves for other key targets like a new centre-forward.",
      "But from Sancho's point of view, the deal would give him an opportunity to play a vital role at his new club - a repeat of what happened the first time he was in Germany. On Tuesday, Dortmund confirmed they had reached an agreement to sign Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland, a transfer which sees the central midfielder walk in the footsteps of his elder brother Jude.",
      "When the current Real Madrid star and England poster boy reflected on his time at Dortmund in 2020, he spoke highly of Sancho and how he developed him as a player. \"Sancho is really important for me,\" the 21-year-old told Kicker.",
      "\"Not only because he comes from the same country as me or because he speaks the same language. What’s more important is how he puts his arm around me but also around the other young players, how he encourages us in our abilities, how he gives us confidence.",
      "\"He is a great role model for English players of my age. To receive praise and encouragement from him means an awful lot to me. It helps me a lot.\"",
      "Having had such a profound impact on the elder Bellingham brother, Sancho knows that he could do the same for Jobe. If he were to join Dortmund, he knows he would be seen as a senior player that can help those younger to enhance their talent.",
      "For Sancho, this is exactly the kind of transfer that he will be wanting to make. He wants to be valued at his next club and at Dortmund that would certainly be the case."

      "The goalkeeper, who played a pivotal role in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League victory and subsequent treble this season, is under contract with the French club until the summer of 2026. However, uncertainty surrounding his future at Parc des Princes has sparked interest from several top-tier clubs.",
      "Among these is United, who are reportedly eager to replace their current keeper, Andre Onana. The Cameroon international had a disappointing season, managing only nine clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Onana wants to stay at United, but that has not stopped the club being linked with other goalkeepers during the off-season. In addition to his treble-winning campaign with PSG, Donnarumma was also named player of the tournament as Italy triumphed in Euro 2020.",
      "With just a year remaining on his contract, clubs across Europe were hoping to take advantage of the situation with a bold approach. Both United and Manchester City were linked to the player, with L'Equipe suggesting that he had discussed a Premier League move with his international teammates.",
      "However, Donnarumma has now affirmed his wish to stay in Paris, predicting few hurdles in the negotiation of a new contract.",
      "Talks between Donnarumma's agents and PSG have been ongoing for several months. The Italian shot-stopper joined the French giants from AC Milan four years ago, but recent reports earlier this week cast doubt over whether a new deal would materialise.",
      "L'Equipe had suggested that PSG presented a final 'take it or leave it' offer to Donnarumma, which included a pay cut. Yet, the player himself now indicates that the contract discussions should encounter minimal hurdles.",
      "Donnarumma's representative has dismissed any speculation about a return to Serie A, despite Napoli being mentioned as a potential suitor. Raiola is instead concentrating on finalising terms with PSG for his client.",
      "\"It's pure fantasy. I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola clarified on Radio CRC as reported by Calciomercato.",
      "\"It's an obvious question; many would like him, but only a few can afford him. He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints.",
      "\"We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juve who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganizing: these factors are fundamental.\""

      "It remains to be seen whether this will impact Man Utd’s hopes of landing Gyokeres, but Fabrizio Romano has provided an update on their move for the forward.",
      "He explained: “Man Utd have called last week, have called over the weekend, and have called again this week for Gyokeres to be informed about the player, to understand the conditions, to understand what’s going on with Sporting, to understand if there is still a chance to make it happen financially after not making it into Champions League.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea are being weird here. They wanted Maignan in for the Club World Cup but refused to pay more than £10-12million, only just over half the price Milan want to sell the France no.1. Now the Blues can’t take him to USA, they don’t want him at all. That makes such little sense that it probably isn’t as dead as Chelsea want us to believe.",

Napoli want around £70million, though they may take Joshua Zirkzee in part-exchange. This one doesn’t pass the sniff test, unless we get to late in the window with all parties in the same position they are now.",

      "16) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Bayer Leverkusen\nThere was talk of interest from Newcastle, which was a move we could really get on board with. But a loan with a £67milion obligation always seemed a little fanciful on City’s part. A £40million deal to replace Florian Wirtz at Leverkusen seems more like the kind of fee City would take for a player with no future under Guardiola, but we’d still rather Grealish stuck around in the Premier League.",

Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. Which doesn’t seem likely any time soon.",

Fine, but he won’t get that at Newcastle while Alexander Isak is around. For how long will that be? That is the more pressing concern for Newcastle fans.",
      "11) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nWord is that Newcastle and Burnley are haggling over the price of a deal that Eddie Howe wanted to do a year ago, with the intention of Trafford and Nick Pope slugging it out for the No.1 spot. Which rarely ever works. Or at least that’s what Howe might tell Pope, but if this comes off, the current Toon keeper’s days are numbered. So Pope might be happy to hear that the two clubs are some way off an agreement with Burnley said to be asking for £40million.",

      "9) 🆕 Wilfried Ndidi – Leicester to Manchester United\nThe Nigeria midfielder has a £9million release clause and United see him as a good value squad addition to bolster their midfield options, especially if they sell Casemiro this summer.

      "8) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker had overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack after much deliberation on the Gunners’ part. But perhaps they hadn’t accounted for how much of a slog it would be to negotiate with RB Leipzig, who are refusing to accept anything under their £70million valuation. As is their right. Especially when Al-Hilal seem keen to cough up if Sesko can be convinced to move to Saudi.",

      "7) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal going cold on Gyokeres, there were plenty of reports that the Swede is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Sporting say they haven’t received any offers and they also insist that reports of a gentleman’s agreement for him to leave for £59million are b*llocks. Which Gyokeres disputes.

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed the precise chances that a Manchester United man joins Chelsea, as he has reiterated that the star ‘will leave’ the club.",
      "United could allow a number of their first-team players to leave this summer. A number of attacking players have been linked with the exit.",
      "Last season’s loan departures Marcus Rashford and Antony are both likely to leave – the former permanently and the latter potentially on another loan.",
      "Fellow forwards Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho are also each being linked with exits.",
      "Garnacho was reportedly told by Ruben Amorim that his United career was over, the boss apparently saying: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "Since then, insider Romano has stated the winger will be leaving. He has reiterated that to DAZN, while stating Garnacho ‘could stay in England’ and placing the chances of him landing at interested side Chelsea at a ’35 per cent chance’.",
      "What calculations have gone into that percentage are unclear. But it is evident that Garnacho would like to head to Stamford Bridge.",
      "It was reported at the beginning of June that the winger had told his agent to make it clear that he wanted to play for Chelsea next.",
      "There will seemingly be chances for him to move out of England too, though.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen are linked, as are Napoli and Atletico Madrid, so there are three potential leagues there. Elsewhere, it’s been reported that Cristiano Ronaldo has demanded Al-Nassr sign Garnacho during contract negotiations.",
      "It’s believed Garnacho is on the radar of the Saudi Pro League side as a result of Ronaldo’s demand, but it’s not clear if they would be able to sign him.",
      "It would be a step backwards for a player to leave United for a move to Saudi Arabia at just 20 years of age.",
      "But Ronaldo is an idol of Garnacho’s, and he got to play just six games with him at United, so there might be a chance that he’d be willing to move to play with him for a period, knowing there’s a lot of time left in his career to go elsewhere.",
      "Man Utd legend Cristiano Ronaldo ‘demanded’ that Al-Nassr signed Alejandro Garnacho this summer during his contract negotiations, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are among the clubs interested in signing Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been linked with Chelsea.",
      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer.",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists that Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is not “the guy” to score goals for the Red Devils next season.",
      "It was thought that Gyokeres would not entertain the idea of leaving Sporting for Man Utd in the summer after Ruben Amorim’s side failed to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "But journalist Ben Jacobs revealed that the Sweden international would actually be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, regardless of them not being in Europe next term.",
      "Before transfer expert Fabrizio Romano gave an update on Tuesday and claimed that Man Utd “called again” about Gyokeres as they keep “informed” on his situation.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",
      "Some Man Utd fans have been excited at the prospect of Gyokeres leading the line next season but club legend Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils should avoid the signing.",
      "Ferdinand was joined on his YouTube channel by host Joel Beya and former Man City defender Joleon Lescott as they discussed Gyokeres’ potential transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Beya declared: “Gyokeres, you’ve got to go for him.” To which Lescott swiftly said: “I believe that you’re going to go for him – but he’s not the guy.”",
      "Ferdinand replied: “I don’t think he’s the guy. I’ve not watched him loads [but] I’ve watched him probably three times really, really closely.",
      "“And three times I’ve gone, ‘He ain’t getting that opportunity in the Prem’. When I see him physically matched, what else is there?",
      "“Is there enough – after he’s physically matched – to get him a goal?”",
      "Lescott added: “You don’t get away with that in the Prem.”",
      "A report on Tuesday in Portugal insisted that Gyokeres is ‘furious’ after Sporting apparently broke a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to sell him for €70m (£59m) in the summer.",
      "It had reportedly been ‘agreed’ that his €100m would ‘not be an obstacle’ for a summer transfer and that Gyokeres ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "But Sporting CP president Frederico Varandas has rejected those claims and insisted that Gyokeres “will not leave” for €70m this summer.",
      "Varandas said: “I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that. To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres – neither today nor last season.”",
      "The Sporting president added: “One of the agent’s biggest concerns was whether we would demand the termination clause.",
      "“He wanted to guarantee certain things. And what was agreed? That Sporting would not demand a release clause now.",
      "“For one reason: he was going to be 27 years old and no player leaves Portugal at 27 for 100m eurors or 90m euros.",
      "“In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: ‘It’s not worth us setting a value because I don’t know what will happen in a year’s time. I don’t know if it will be 40m euros, 60m euros or 80m euros. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100 million euros.”",

      "Whitwell told Stretford Paddock’s YouTube channel: “The first bid was £45m, plus £10m in add-ons… but I think Brentford want a fee more in line with what United paid for Cunha. They’ve looked at it and thought, this is what you’re paying for Cunha, Mbeumo also scores goals, so…",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "“So now we’re at a point where the clubs are deciding how much that is going to be. I think all the sides think that this will get done, but I don’t think it is imminent.",
      "“I don’t believe anything is going to happen today (Tuesday, before the mini summer deadline), but my personal view is that it will get done eventually.”",
      "When asked if there is anything incoming Tottenham boss Thomas Frank could do to turn Mbeumo’s head at this stage, Whitwell replied: “No, I don’t think so.",
      "“I’m sure the player will have known the likelihood of what that was (Frank leaving for Spurs), but that was trailed as something for quite a while and if the player really felt he wanted it, he could have gone there.”",
      "Picking out the reasons why Mbeumo has chosen Man Utd, Whitwell continued: “He has a clear vision and can see how he fits into the system at United.",
      "“The stature of the place – and I know people have been upset about him choosing Man Utd when there is no European football on offer.",
      "“But clearly, the raised profile you get from your own personal brand, let’s say, and also the opportunity to play in that stadium (Old Trafford), the pressure, the eyeballs that come with it, I think it (United) are still an appealing prospect to a lot of players.”",
      "Former CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs echoed a lot of what Whitwell had said when asked about a potential Tottenham hijack of the deal.",
      "Jacobs said on The United Stand: “Regarding the Spurs part in all of this. You can never say definitively that Thomas Frank won’t influence Tottenham’s transfer business.",
      "“My understanding is very clear as of now, Tottenham know Mbeumo’s preference is Manchester United, as do all other suitors.",
      "“Just because a new manager comes in, especially under Daniel Levy, it’s very unlikely they’ll turn around to Thomas Frank and say ‘is getting Mbeumo a deal breaker and can you hijack Manchester United’s plans.’",
      "“I’m not expecting Thomas Frank’s expected arrival at Tottenham to hugely influence the Mbeumo situation, the most important thing is that Mbeumo wants to join Manchester United and if the clubs agree the fee, regardless of the Tottenham situation, Mbeumo will still pick Manchester United.”",

      "Another area in which United were poor was in net, with Andre Onana making three errors leading to goals in the league and more in Europe.",
      "The Red Devils have been linked with the signing of Barcelona icon Marc-Andre ter Stegen of late. Fichajes reports United, Galatasaray and Al-Hilal all want to sign the German stopper.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly joined a pair of rival sides in pursuit of an expensive striker, but they “would like” to sign a cheaper option if possible.",
      "United have already moved to ensure they are more competitive next season than they were last. They’re in desperate need of improving their attacking areas, and have landed Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move.",
      "But he is more of a wide man or No.10, and United still want to improve upon their central striking options, given how poor Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee were last season.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been linked for some time given he played under Ruben Amorim at Sporting CP – and scored 54 goals in club football last season.",
      "He remains on the radar, but there’s another top talent being looked at now, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "“They’re running data on some other names as well, including Hugo Ekitike, which is a new name that I can bring to the mix too,” Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT.",
      "“Liverpool are very interested, Chelsea have held some talks as well, but nothing’s going to happen in the next days with Hugo Ekitike either and Frankfurt want €100million, so he’s actually more expensive than Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "“So right now, I’m told, if Manchester United can do Gyokeres, they would like to advance on it, but it will all depend on the overall cost and other suitors, and that’s why some of these other names are also concurrently being discussed.”",
      "It’s not a surprise than Gyokeres is the main target, having scored 32 goals more than Ekitike’s 22 last season.",
      "The Swedish striker is in fact said to be very keen on a move to Old Trafford, though they can’t offer European football.",
      "But there are sides who can offers that in the mix, with Juventus joining Arsenal in pursuit of the United target. Fabrizio Romano has confirmed the Italian outfit are taking steps to sign Gyokeres.",
      "“We know it’s complicated for Italian clubs to make these kinds of deals.",
      "“I’m not saying Juventus will sign Gyokeres, but I can guarantee that Juventus called over the weekend to be informed about the situation.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United target Viktor Gyokeres has decided to ‘go on strike’ as he looks to secure a big move elsewhere this summer.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists that Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is not “the guy” to score goals for the Red Devils next season.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is ‘worried’ by Arsenal interest in Viktor Gyokeres as RB Leipzig continue to make a deal difficult, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are at risk of being hijacked in the race to sign Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres after a ‘direct call’.",
      "Man Utd have initiated “new contacts” as they “call again” to get a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres over the line, according to reports.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is reportedly ‘furious’ over a broken transfer ‘promise’ as Sporting Lisbon have set a new ‘demand’ for the Manchester United target."

      "Man Utd are looking to bring in a new goalkeeper over the summer with the Red Devils turning their attention to a Poland international, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils’ summer transfer business is well underway with INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe providing Ruben Amorim with the funds to improve his squad.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves in a £62.5m deal, while Man Utd have had a couple of bids rejected for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "As well as the attack, there have been rumours linking Man Utd with new goalkeepers, including Aston Villa stopper Emiliano Martinez.",
      "That is because of the poor form of Andre Onana last season with some fans hoping that he will be sold in the summer and replaced by a different goalkeeper.",
      "But former Man Utd defender Wes Brown has warned supporters that it isn’t as easy as “just selling” the player as the Red Devils will want to recoup some money for him.",
      "Brown said recently: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "READ: Man City still only sixth in Premier League net spend table over the last five years",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors. And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",
      "But there has been a new link with SPORTS ZONE claiming that Man Utd are interested in Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka with the Poland international ‘open’ to a transfer this summer.",
      "The outlet wrote on X: ‘EXCL. Manchester United is now looking for a new GK. 25 yo OGC Nice GK Marcin Bułka among interests. Marcin Bulka is open to a move this summer as he has already asked to leave Nice.’",
      "But Man Utd would seemingly have to wait until after September to complete the signing of Bulka with the Red Devils and Nice both owned by INEOS.",
      "Despite both clubs being allowed to compete in Europe together last season, UEFA said that Man Utd and Nice ‘will not transfer players to each other, whether permanently or on loan, directly or indirectly, from July 2024 until September 2025, with the exception of pre-existing transfer agreements that had been entered into before the opening of the CFCB proceedings.’",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘found’ an ‘ideal replacement for a current starter with Ruben Amorim and INEOS keen to sign an upgrade.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked a “world-class” goalkeeper they ‘want’ to replace £47m flop Andre Onana.",
      "Plus mentions for Tottenham, West Ham, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho, and a couple of managers whose sides instantly improved after they left",
      "It’s probably Matz Sels on the eye test, but the stats say that Ederson has been tested more than Alisson and comes out well on top.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he’s decided to leave Andre Onana out of the squad for Sunday’s match against Aston Villa."

      "But the plundering of Brentford might not stop there as Frank has ‘demanded’ that Bryan Mbeumo accompany him on the trip to Spurs, who will have to hijack Man Utd’s move for the forward.",
      "It would not be the first time a manager has joined a bigger club and made sure one of his players joins him – although Spurs will hope it goes better than most of these examples.",
      "",
      "Marouane Fellaini\nDavid Moyes “never wanted Marouane Fellaini to be my first Man Utd signing”, but the subtext is hilarious and crucial.",
      "While he always intended to pack the Belgian among his belongings for the trip from Everton to Old Trafford, the manager was painfully aware of The Optics in using the rare transfer pull of one of the biggest clubs in world football to immediately bring in a relatively uncultured player from his old club.",
      "But Ed Woodward somehow contrived to deliver an even more embarrassing scenario in his first and worst transfer window at Man Utd. Fellaini was the only signing handed down to Moyes after futile pursuits of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Thiago Alcantara, Cesc Fabregas, Ander Herrera and Fabio Coentrao, among a great many others.",
      "“I knew, coming from my old club, the look of him was never going to be [right for United],” Moyes added. It undeniably contributed to the sheer incompetence of Man Utd signing Fellaini for £27.5m on September 3, despite there being a release clause in his contract making him £4m cheaper up to July 31.",
      "Not that Moyes’ concern over perception prevented the club from making a joint bid for Fellaini and Leighton Baines earlier that summer.",
      "The tales of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic being shown tapes of Phil Jagielka are regrettably apocryphal but it is without doubt that a manager out of his depth clutched a comfort blanket that carried the scent of Goodison Park as his big career break ended in inevitable failure.",
      "Then again, as Sunderland manager a few years later Moyes openly said of Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj that he would “drive down to Manchester and pick them up” if a deal was possible, so the bloke obviously just values familiarity.",
      "",
      "Arouna Kone\nIt is remarkable that Moyes jumping up to Man Utd was not the most absurd case of overpromotion those circumstances produced. Rarely ever has a manager failed upwards quite so impressively as Roberto Martinez with Everton.",
      "The Spaniard arrived at Goodison Park as the Moyes replacement armed with an FA Cup winner’s medal, but the addition of a Premier League relegation on his CV suggested the arrangement might not end so well.",
      "A brilliant first season was the precursor to two years of expensive backwards steps, by which point Martinez was sacked and again ludicrously fell higher up the managerial ladder by being entrusted with the Golden Generations of both Belgium and Portugal.",
      "Martinez surely spent his first days in both posts investigating the genealogy of his old Wigan squad. His first signing at Everton was that of Kone, who described it as “an honour to be back working with the manager once again”.",
      "James McCarthy made the same jump soon afterwards, passing Fellaini in the Finch Farm reception on deadline day as Man Utd, Everton and Wigan crystallised their respective places in the football food chain to an unnecessary extent.",
      "",
      "Richarlison\nFrank will inherit a fractured Spurs dressing room in any case but the undying support of one player would have been guaranteed with a different intra-Premier League appointment.",
      "Richarlison specifically cited how he felt it was “important for me here to be with Marco Silva again” when Everton “spoiled” the entire transfer window by signing him in summer 2018.",
      "The pair had first crossed paths at Watford when Silva personally intervened to hijack the Brazilian’s planned move to Ajax. The Hornets sacked Silva five months later in a rare show of impatience with a manager, who landed at Everton by the summer.",
      "His first port of call was to link back up with Richarlison who, for his many faults, helped keep the Toffees up and never lacked for effort before leaving at a profit when Spurs came calling in summer 2022.",
      "",
      "Joe Allen\n“We have got some protection on Brendan coming back for our players in the initial period, which I think is the right thing,” Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said of a gentleman’s agreement – or what he termed “a 12-month respite” – designed to prevent Liverpool from raiding the Welsh club for anything more than their manager.",
      "It lasted all of 70 days. While Rodgers reunited with former Swansea loanee Fabio Borini in his first signing as head coach at Anfield, the Northern Irishman immediately went back on that handshake deal with his former employers to return for Allen.",
      "A furious Swansea lambasted Liverpool for reneging on “a written agreement” not to sign any of their players within a year of Rodgers’ appointment, but a clause which permitted Allen to join the Reds, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or Man Utd for £15m overrode any informal accord.",
      "Swansea, realising Rodgers was likely willing to drag them through every court around the globe and fight to the death to sign a player so courageous, relented and decided to just win the League Cup with Ki Sung-yueng instead.",
      "",
      "Jermain Defoe\nIt is one of the great bits of Barclays folklore that the 18 most expensive signings in Harry Redknapp’s 34-year, almost 1,400-game managerial career only actually involve 15 players.",
      "Sandro ranks 18th and 12th. Peter Crouch is 8th and 5th. And Defoe comes 14th and 2nd. It is an unfathomably effective way of saying someone managed Spurs, Portsmouth and QPR without explicitly stating it.",
      "And the only thing preventing Niko Kranjcar from making that list is that he did not cost all that much on any of the three separate occasions Redknapp signed him.",
      "“This is the third club I have signed him for. I know what a top-class player he is,” Redknapp said after making Defoe his first signing as Spurs manager in January 2009, spending £15m on a player he bought for £9m as Portsmouth boss 12 months before, and West Ham poached for £1m or so before the turn of the millennium.",
      "That shared history spawned one of the great Redknapp stories – how he downplayed the need for Defoe to undergo a medical before completing the deadline day rule-breaking Portsmouth move “because he knew me from a kid and that” – but it was in north London where he laid the foundations for success on those diminutive but broad shoulders as his first purchase.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s new left-back won’t have too much difficulty in making more of a mark at Man Utd than the first signings of the post-Fergie managers.",
      "Nottingham Forest are throwing their weight around with plans for signings which were previously unrealistic. Either break transfer records or all the rules."

      "The only possible way the title of most expensive uncapped English player would change hands from a Manchester United signing was with a switch of countries.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Alex Scott (Bristol City to Bournemouth, £20m to £25m, August 2023)\nGary O’Neil must have been sick of the sight of Bournemouth in summer 2023, losing out on top Wolves target Scott to the team which traded him for Andoni Iraola months prior.",
      "Scott, then a teenager, eventually impressed after overcoming an injury which delayed his Bournemouth debut. On a different timeline he really might have made that England squad for Euro 2024 but his first U21 call only came that March as other cabs flew off the rank ahead of him.",
      "",
      "19) Tyrone Mings (Bournemouth to Aston Villa, £20m to £26.5m, July 2019)\nIt was A Big Thing when Aston Villa agreed to chuck £20m Bournemouth’s way in the process of making the loan of Mings a more permanent feature in 2019.",
      "The centre-half had played a key part in their rise from the Championship and as that year’s official Promoted Team That Makes A Load Of New Signings, it made perfect sense from Villa’s viewpoint if no-one else’s. An England squad place arrived a few months later and the Villa captaincy followed in 2021, much to Steven Gerrard’s future chagrin.",
      "",
      "18) Jobe Bellingham (Sunderland to Borussia Dortmund, £27.8m to £32m, June 2025)\nOther interested parties included Bundesliga rivals Leipzig and Frankfurt but it is a remarkably strong pitch to simply ask a player how their brother is doing. Dortmund primed Jude for superstardom and Jobe will be eyeing those footsteps like any other hand-me-down.",
      "",
      "17) Jude Bellingham (Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund, £22.5m to £30m, July 2020)\nManchester United pulled out all the stops and even wheeled in Sir Alex Ferguson but Borussia Dortmund’s pitch involved nonsense like clear pathways to the first team and boring Bellingham decided to make the best possible decision for his career instead of picking based on banter and vibes because he is boring.",
      "Within four months of his Germany move, Bellingham was firmly embedded in the England set-up, not to be moved for about two decades. He cannot have been far off doing a Jay Bothroyd and claiming a Three Lions caps while playing for a lower-division club.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Sheffield United to Arsenal, £24m to £30m, August 2021)\nRamsdale was as uncapped by the senior England side when he joined Arsenal as when he moved back to Sheffield United from Bournemouth the year before. The only difference this time was the ridicule he faced upon that switch to north London as a twice-relegated keeper signed as back-up for Bernd Leno.",
      "It took Ramsdale a couple of months to prove the doubters wrong and not much longer to force his way into the England picture. But both club and country moved on quickly to leave him stranded in the Championship.",
      "",
      "15) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",

      "",
      "14) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "13) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "12) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "11) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "10) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "9) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "7) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F3650\n👉 Transfer rumour power ranking: Arsenal deal ‘done’, Chelsea’s nonsense stance\n👉 Premier League players who need a summer transfer for World Cup place: Grealish, Chiesa",
      "",
      "6) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "5) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "4) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "3) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "2) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "1) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’, but even when he does make that first international appearance, he will remain England’s most expensive uncapped player ever at least in spirit.",
      "Liverpool had have one Florian Wirtz bid rejected and may not find success with a second falling short of Leverkusen’s valuation. They have been here before.",
      "Cole Palmer was poor in an infuriatingly tepid England performance vs Andorra, while Noni Madueke was comfortably Thomas Tuchel’s best player…",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Noni Madueke and Robert Sanchez are on a list of 14 players put up for sale by Chelsea this summer, and Cole Palmer has been tipped for a shock exit.",
      "The imminent signing of Florian Wirtz at Liverpool “isn’t going to stop” the Reds from attempting to sign Anthony Gordon, according to reports.",
      "Cole Palmer has spoken of his excitement to play in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final amid heading praise on Enzo Maresca."

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea. Spurs are also reportedly keen.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and Arsenal. Galatasaray and Fenerbahce have also reportedly offered the German big money. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund)\nA transfer to Chelsea looks extremely likely for the promising young winger, who scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 48 matches for Dortmund in 2024/25.",
      "The Blues want Gittens for the Club World Cup and are actively pursuing him, submitting a new €50m bid on Tuesday. If that fails, they won’t give up, and when the transfer window re-opens, they will surely land the 20-year-old – who has reportedly ‘ignored’ interest from Arsenal to pursue a move to west London.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked. Surprisingly, he wants to join the Red Devils over the other two clubs. Thomas Frank to Spurs could throw a spanner in the works, though…",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "His performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",

      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",

      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "",
      "Federico Chiesa (Liverpool and Italy)\nThere is no chance Chiesa makes it to the World Cup if 2025/26 is anything like his miserable debut season at Liverpool. Fourteen appearances. Four starts. Arne Slot’s side won the title at a canter and barely needed him.",
      "A serious knee injury after Euro 2020 prevented Chiesa from kicking on when he was being touted as one of the best wingers in the world. There was talk of a £100m move to the Premier League but he ended up joining Liverpool for around £12.5m in 2024.",
      "He’s now a shadow of his former self, and rotting on the bench helps nobody. Not him. Not Italy. He needs to accept defeat – urgently.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot (Manchester United and Portugal)\nDalot’s slipped down the pecking order at United following Erik ten Hag’s departure – not because of favouritism, but because he simply doesn’t suit Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back formation.",
      "His form has nosedived. There’s more room for improvement here than with most others on this list, but if he’s not trusted as a wing-back and can’t play centre-back, he’s going to spend a lot of time on the bench.",
      "United are open to selling anyone. They’d have flogged Bruno Fernandes if he’d been willing to move to Saudi Arabia. With a World Cup looming, this summer is pivotal for Dalot and friends.",
      "",
      "Niclas Fullkrug (West Ham and Germany)\nLike Pedro and Brazil, the No.9 spot is there for the taking for Germany. Kai Havertz is a shoo-in as things stand – and that’s not even his natural position. Then again, what is?",
      "West Ham’s 2024/25 season was a disaster. Fullkrug’s assessment of their “s**t” performances was the most entertainment they offered. The German needs service to score – and hasn’t had any. He didn’t adapt, and poor seasons from Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and co. didn’t help.",
      "A swift return to the Bundesliga could be perfect. He scored 12 and assisted eight in 29 league games for Borussia Dortmund in 2023/24, and has 14 goals in 22 caps for Germany. If he stays at West Ham, the only justification for calling him up would be that goal record.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool and England)\nGomez feels like a stellar squad player option for England, but even that might be out of reach if he spends another season doing next to nothing at Liverpool.",
      "It’s a surprise he hasn’t pushed for a move already. There’s no sign of him flying up Arne Slot’s defensive pecking order – not as a right-back, centre-back or left-back. That versatility makes him valuable for club and country. But not if no-one’s using it.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho (Manchester United and England)\nBack to square one, then? Where does Sancho go from here? A permanent exit from Manchester United is inevitable, but who’s going to take him?",
      "Swallowing his pride and moving to a West Ham or Crystal Palace might be his best option in the Premier League – they can offer European football, which United can’t. But it might be smarter to head abroad again. Borussia Dortmund gave him a lifeline and he repaid them by helping them reach a Champions League final. Maybe they’ll do him a favour again.",
      "Either way, Sancho needs to be playing regularly and impressively if he wants even a sniff of a World Cup return. Right now, he’s not even in the conversation.",

      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Gyokeres was and remains an option for Arsenal in terms of new striker. Because at the moment my information is Arsenal are advancing on the deal for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“So Sesko is the clear favourite, there are conversations ongoing. But it’s still not a done deal. So until the Sesko deal is a done we have to be careful.",
      "“At the moment Sesko remains the favourite, Viktor Gyokeres remains the other option on the table, but as it’s now two or three weeks that Arsenal are still not advancing on the Gyokeres deal, all the other clubs keep calling his agents.",
      "“That’s what happened in the last 48 hours over the weekend. From what I heard, last week Man Utd had new contacts with Viktor Gyokeres’ camp, to be informed on the situation, something like ‘okay, if Arsenal are not doing the deal we are still there, we are still interested’.",
      "“Then for Man Utd we have to see financially how they can make it happen, because with Champions League football I’m 99 per cent convinced that they were going to close the Gyokeres deal quite quick. That was the feeling.",
      "“Then no Champions League football, they lost the [Europa League] final in Bilbao, and so it’s more complicated financially.",
      "“But for Gyokeres, Man Utd called again. Let’s see if they’re able to make it happen but there were new contacts with the agent of the player.”",

      "The Swedish international is a frontrunner to be this year’s top scorer in Europe and he’s attracted interest from several sides in recent months.",
      "Man Utd and Arsenal have been the main Premier League clubs in the running to land Gyokeres, but the Red Devils appear to be more likely to sign the forward as the Gunners are currently pursuing RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Gyokeres could join the two No.10s in signing for Man Utd, but they have hurdles to overcome to sign the prolific striker.",
      "In recent months, it’s been reported that he has a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to leave Sporting Lisbon for a set fee in the region of €70m (£59m), but a new report in Portugal claims they have instead decided to hold out for a higher price.",
      "This is according to Portuguese outlet Record, who claim Gyokeres is ‘furious’ at this latest development.",
      "It was previously ‘agreed’ that his €100m release clause would ‘not be an obstacle’ and he ‘could leave if Sporting received a concrete offer of €60 million, plus €10 million depending on objectives’.",
      "However, Sporting chiefs are ‘not respecting’ these set terms and are ‘demanding a higher amount’ than that was initially ‘stipulated’ as they want €80m for their prized asset.",
      "‘This has not gone down well’ with Gyokeres as he ‘believes that the club is failing to deliver on what it promised at the beginning of the season’.",
      "The report also lifts the lid on a previous meeting between Gyokeres and the club’s hierarchy.",
      "‘Another source close to the process confirmed that at the beginning of the season there was a meeting between Frederico Varandas and Sporting’s former football director, Hugo Viana, with Gyökeres and his agent, in which it was explained to the player that the club would not demand the value of the termination clause due to his age (at the time of the events, 26 years old), without the president of the lions having set a value to release him.",
      "‘The same source added that, to date, Sporting has not received any official offer for the forward.’",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",

      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",

      "First summer transfer window shuts as Premier League's Club World Cup clubs, Chelsea and Manchester City, both make moves ahead of tournament; Man Utd make most expensive signing with £62.5m arrival of Matheus Cunha; main summer window reopens on Monday and closes on September 1",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 10:08, UK",
      "As the summer's first transfer window slams shut, Premier League clubs have spent nearly half a billion on new signings - and there is still so much business to be done.",
      "Few knew what to expect from this special window brought in ahead of the Club World Cup - but it has delivered 10 days of transfer drama and set the tone for what promises to be a fascinating summer. And we are just six days away from it re-opening.",
      "Manchester City have been the big spenders thus far after doing their business early by bringing in Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli - taking their outlay to £116.2m.",
      "Despite three of City's signings being announced on Deadline Day, it was Chelsea, the other Premier League team at the Club World Cup, that were centre of attention once again as they chased potential late deals for Jamie Gittens and Mike Maignan.",
      "Chelsea ended their pursuit of Maignan, the AC Milan goalkeeper, around lunchtime because the Italian club were unwilling to lower their demands for the 29-year-old, who is out of contract in a year and valued at no more than £12m by the Blues.",
      "Their chase for Gittens had more legs but also ended in disappointment - for now at least. Dortmund rejected Chelsea's £42m bid and demanded closer to £55m late in the day and time ran out for the clubs to come to an agreement.",
      "Chelsea were happy to wait as they do not want to overpay for Gittens and plan to revisit the deal further down the line. Gittens, who wants to move to Chelsea, appeared frustrated as he sped out of Dortmund's training ground at day's end.",
      "Dortmund were able to get an incoming deal over the line ahead of the tournament as they signed Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland in a club-record sale for the newly-promoted Premier League club, who are receiving an initial £27.8m for the 19-year-old.",
      "Before Bellingham's exit, the Black Cats had confirmed the club-record £20m signing of midfielder Enzo Le Fee after a successful loan spell from Roma.",
      "Premier League clubs have splashed nearly £500m after only 10 days of the first summer window, which is already close to half the amount spent during the entire 2021/22 summer window.",
      "Manchester City have been the most spendthrift club as Pep Guardiola's side look to rebuild after a disappointing campaign, spending a table-topping £116.3m so far.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Wolves are nearly £100m in profit after selling star players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait Nouri.",
      "Burnley and Chelsea lead the way for total incomings, with both sides signing four players on permanent deals. Only seven sides are yet to secure a signing.",
      "Arsenal have offloaded 17 players, while Wolves (13), Burnley and Spurs (both 10) have also trimmed their squads considerably.",
      "Cunha's £62.5m switch to Manchester United is the most expensive deal in the window so far, followed by Tijjani Reijnders (£46.3m), Rayan Ait Nouri (£36m), Jean-Clair Todibo (£35m) and Rayan Cherki (£34m).",
      "In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth cashed in £50m from selling Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, while Sunderland sold Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for £32m and Manchester City sold Yan Couto to Dortmund for £25m.",
      "Meanwhile, Chelsea bolstered their frontline ahead of the Club World Cup with the £30m arrival of Liam Delap from Ipswich.",
      "The 22-year-old is one of three signings along with Mamadou Sarr and Dario Essugo, who have been recruited in time to play in the USA. Estevao Willian will join from Palmeiras after the Club World Cup - and he could face Chelsea at the tournament playing for the Brazilian side.",
      "Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko emerged as a option for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal, who have been turned down by Bruno Fernandes and Victor Osimhen in the last week, as they scrambled to make a marquee signing in time for the Club World Cup.",
      "However, the RB Leipzig striker's preference to play for a top club in Europe amid talks with Arsenal appeared to stop Al Hilal from taking their interest any further on Deadline Day. They will have to make do with Aleksandar Mitrovic as their striker in the USA.",
      "Sesko will be one of the names to watch for the rest of the summer, with Arsenal seemingly prioritising a move for the 22-year-old ahead of Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres in their hunt for a striker. Adding a left-winger is another priority, with Real Madrid's Rodrygo a top target. At the other end of the pitch, Arsenal are progressing with a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and are expected to trigger the £5m release clause.",
      "The Gunners have taken a backseat in the early running of the window, though, with Premier League champions Liverpool making multiple club-record bids for attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen after he turned down Bayern Munich.",
      "Wirtz only wants to move to Anfield but so far the clubs have failed to reach an agreement with Liverpool's latest offer worth £113m - just £2m shy of the British record set by Moises Caicedo's transfer to Chelsea from Brighton in 2023.",
      "The Germany international's keenness on the move has ensured the lengthy negotiations have not created too much anxiety among Liverpool fans, who have lost key player Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid for £10m and goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher to Brentford in an £18m deal.",
      "But Liverpool, who have goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili joining from Valencia, have already signed a right-sided player following Alexander-Arnold's exit with the £29.5m arrival of Jeremie Frimpong, while on the other side, they are eyeing a move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.",
      "Initial contact has been made with the Cherries, who have already lined up a replacement in Adrien Truffert from Rennes. Andoni Iraola's side face a potential rebuild this summer, having already lost Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid for £50m, while they have received an approach from Paris Saint-Germain for Illia Zabarnyi.",
      "An offer from Liverpool for Kerkez is the next step in that deal, but how many more incomings there will be at Anfield could depend on the future of Luis Diaz.",
      "The 28-year-old raised doubts about his future when he revealed he was in talks with other clubs while away with Colombia after the Merseyside club rejected an approach from Barcelona.",
      "Diaz is one of two targets Barcelona have for the forward position, along with Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, whose future appears certain to be away from Old Trafford. Interest is expected in the 27-year-old, who will cost £40m this summer.",
      "Manchester United have been unusually quick out of the blocks with their business after signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m - the most expensive signing of the summer so far.",
      "Man Utd are already eyeing their second summer signing with an approach for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, who is keen on the move.",
      "The Bees have turned down their opening £55m offer, though talks are continuing and United are expected to return with an improved offer for the forward, valued at more than £60m. Once that pursuit has concluded, the plan is to try and sign a striker.",
      "Gyokeres is one of their targets, and approaches have been made for the Sporting striker through intermediaries as United look to ascertain the conditions of a potential deal. It will likely take a few sales to facilitate any further signings after the potential arrival of Mbeumo, though.",
      "Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are among those who could go with plenty of interest anticipated. Rasmus Hojlund is a target for Inter Milan but has said he expects to remain at United despite the club being linked to other strikers.",
      "Man Utd's Europa League final conquerors, Tottenham, are yet to make a fresh addition to their squad as they close in on the managerial appointment of Thomas Frank after sacking Ange Postecoglou. But Spurs have stepped up their interest in Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo, valued at £70m by the south coast club.",
      "Tottenham are one of 12 Premier League clubs yet to make a major summer signing (excluding loans being made permanent, or deals agreed in previous windows), so expect things to really ramp up when the transfer window reopens on Monday before closing on September 1 at 7pm.",

      "United are in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future. Although the Denmark international has said he is not considering leaving the club and will fight for his place next season, United are looking at a number of players in that position.",
      "However, a big focus at United will be on departures too, with offers expected for the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "The preference is to agree to permanent sales for those players, however loan deals cannot be ruled out. There has been plenty of interest - but as yet, no formal offers.",
      "Sporting paid roughly £20m to sign Gyokeres from Coventry in 2023 but they are expected to make a huge profit on his anticipated sale.",
      "The 27-year-old, who scored 40 times in 97 games for Coventry, joining on loan from Brighton initially before making the move permanent in 2021, has hit new heights since his switch to Portugal, smashing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, including 11 in 17 in European competition.",
      "His remarkable scoring exploits have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, who valued him at less than £1m when he joined Coventry from Brighton in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has proved a late bloomer but his rapid rise to prominence in recent seasons has put him on the shortlists of some of the biggest clubs in Europe.",
      "His availability for £58m, considerably less than his Transfermarkt valuation, has made him even more attractive to his suitors, including Manchester United. A reunion with Amorim, the manager who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, now looks a possibility.",

      "The explosion in his value began after that, as he followed up an 18-goal first season at Coventry with a 22-goal campaign in his second. In the summer of 2023, his Transfermarkt valuation was roughly in line with the £20m fee paid by Sporting.",

      "His scoring rate of 1.25 goals per 90 minutes was higher than anyone else's. He also ranked top for touches in the opposition box. He was in the 97th percentile for shots, at 4.46 per 90 minutes.",
      "He ranked in the 98th and 95th percentiles for fast breaks and successful take-ons, underlining his ball-carrying ability, and he also posted impressive numbers creatively.",
      "His average of 1.99 chances created per 90 minutes put him in the 96th percentile among strikers in Europe's top-seven leagues. He ranked in the 84th percentile for assists on 0.22 per 90 minutes.",
      "Gyokeres demonstrated impressive intensity out of possession too, ranking in the 97th percentile for possessions won in the final third, reflecting the effectiveness of his pressing.",
      "There is of course a caveat in that Gyokeres has been competing in a comparatively weak league. According to UEFA coefficient rankings, Portugal's top-flight sits below the Dutch Eredivisie as the seventh strongest in Europe.",
      "Could he replicate his scoring feats in the league which ranks top?",
      "Gyokeres showed his suitability to English football with his impressive spell at Coventry, but the Premier League is a huge step up from the Championship - and from the Portuguese league.",
      "Manchester United must weigh up that unknown as they ponder the pros and cons of a potential move, but they can offer the familiarity of the head coach, in Amorim, who helped bring the best out of him at Sporting, a club who now stand to profit considerably from his sale.",

      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "Former Man Utd, Real Madrid, AC Milan and PSG midfielder David Beckham to be knighted in King's Birthday Honours List in June; Beckham was England captain for over five years and attempted to help bring 2018 World Cup to UK",
      "Friday 6 June 2025 11:46, UK",
      "David Beckham is set to receive a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours List.",
      "The former England captain who is an OBE will receive further recognition for both his career as a footballer and his contributions to British society.",
      "The full list of honours recipients is due to be published next week.",
      "Beckham began his football career at Man Utd, where he made 394 appearances and scored 85 goals, before going on to play for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and PSG.",
      "He made 115 appearances for England, the third-highest of any senior men's player, and captained his country 59 times.",
      "The Unicef goodwill ambassador, who turned 50 in May, would take on the title of Sir and his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, would become Lady Beckham.",
      "He had been on the verge of receiving a knighthood in the 2014 New Year's Honours list but HM Revenue and Customs placed a red flag on his nomination due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme, according to previous reports.",
      "Speculation that Beckham was in line for a knighthood grew after he announced his retirement from football in 2013.",
      "Footage published by The Sun shows the King asking Beckham if he \"received his 50th birthday present\", during a conversation at the Chelsea Flower Show last month.",
      "The King appeared to say \"I'm glad it got to you\", with Beckham responding: \"It was incredible, thank you, it was very kind\".",
      "The Queen was then heard telling Beckham: \"I'm glad you got the roses.\"",
      "The Independent's chief football writer Miguel Delaney on Back Pages Tonight:",
      "\"His football career speaks for itself, a Champions League winner at Man Utd and one of the best players in one of their best-ever teams.",
      "\"On to Real Madrid, then Milan, there's obviously influence in America. But the trajectory of his lifestyle has gone in a completely wider direction.",
      "\"The one slight surprise is where Beckham had seemed to be on course for a knighthood for so long, but he received a lot of criticism when he worked for the Qatar World Cup hosts.",
      "\"I remember hearing a story about Beckham's role there - it was a highly politicised World Cup, Iran and USA were in the same group and delegates in the same room wouldn't talk to each other, but then Beckham walks in and he causes it to light up.",
      "\"It's hard not to feel like that influences some of this. Especially talking about this kind of ambassadorial role which his very name carries.\"",
