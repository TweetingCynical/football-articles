      "Brentford have dropped a major hint that Bryan Mbeumo’s protracted transfer to Manchester United could finally be about to go through.",
      "United have been chasing Mbeumo for weeks, but have come up against a determined resistance from Brentford, who have refused to budge over their asking price. The Bees have rejected two offers from United for the Cameroon international, who they believe is worth at least £63million.",
      "Brentford have seen United pay £62.5m for Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Anthony Elanga go from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle for £55m and are playing hard ball over their most prized asset. Nevertheless, the club are not blind to the fact that Mbeumo wants to leave and they have begun making contingency plans.",
      "The Evening Standard reports that they have identified Ipswich Town star Omari Hutchinson as a replacement for Mbeumo, although they have yet to make contact. Hutchinson only joined Ipswich from Chelsea last summer in a club-record deal worth £22.5m, but could be set to leave a year later.",
      "He got three goals and two assists in 31 appearances last season as Ipswich were relegated and reportedly prefers the idea of moving back to London. Chelsea have a buy-back clause, but are unlikely to stand in Brentford’s way, given they have already signed wingers Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian from Borussia Dortmund and Palmeiras respectively this summer.",
      "Brentford have already lost manager Thomas Frank to Tottenham – replacing him with Keith Andrews – and captain Christian Norgaard, who joined Arsenal, and are now facing the possible departures of Mbeumo and striker Yoane Wissa. But the west London side have developed a reputation for shrewd work in the transfer market.",
      "Hutchinson is still only 21 years old and scored in the final as England under-21s beat Germany 3-2 in the under-21 Euros in the summer. He wants to play Premier League football next season and would relish the chance to replace Mbeumo, who got 20 league goals on the right wing in 2024/25.",
      "“Let’s see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal’s right, there’s a deal to do, if not then he stays. We’ve spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It’s not a given that he’s going to depart this summer. There is interest.",
      "“He had a great season last season so it’s inevitable there’s going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there’s potentially a deal to be done but there’s only so much we can say on that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The 23-year-old is alleged to have placed 354 bets on matches between February 25, 2020 and December 4, 2022. He has been given until July 18 to respond to the charge.",

      "A statement from the FA read: \"Lewis Macari of Notts County FC has been charged with breaching The FA's betting rules. It's alleged that the player breached FA Rule E1(b) 354 times by placing bets on football matches between 25 February 2020 and 4 December 202: Lewis Macari has until 18 July to provide a response.\"",
      "Notts County said in the statement: “The FA have informed us that Lewis Macari has been charged in relation to alleged breaches of their betting rules.",
      "“The alleged offences took place between 25 February 2020 and 4 December 2022. We will be supporting Lewis and his representatives throughout the investigation process and will be making no further comment at this stage.”",
      "Macari has made 61 appearances for Notts County since joining the League Two side from Stoke in 2023. The defender, who has represented Scotland at Under-18 level, made 33 appearances for County last season as they finished sixth in League Two.",
      "The club ended up missing out on promotion, losing to AFC Wimbledon in the play-off semi-final, and will begin their League Two campaign on August 2, when they are away to Newport County.",
      "Macari is the latest player to be charged by the FA for alleged betting breaches this year, following ex-Cheltenham and Shrewsbury striker Ryan Bowman and Wimbledon’s Osman Foyo.",
      "Bowman was slapped with a three-and-a-half year ban for placing 6,397 bets over an eight-year period. Foyo, meanwhile, was charged last week over alleged bets placed on 252 occasions between October 2023 and March 2025.",
      "Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali served a 10-month ban for breaching betting rules following an investigation by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). The Italy international, who joined Newcastle from AC Milan in July 2023 for £55million, agreed to an 18-month disqualification, eight months of which will be commuted to \"a therapeutic plan\" to help \"recovery from gambling addiction\".",
      "The Professional Footballers’ Association of Northern Ireland partnered with software provider Gamban to block the use of gambling in April.",
      "Melissa Etherington, partnerships executive at Gamban, said: “Gambling addiction is a growing issue in football, which impacts mental health, finances and a player’s performance on the pitch.",
      "“It also has the potential to impact sports integrity. We are delighted to partner with PFA NI to raise awareness of Gamban among those most at risk from harms related to online gambling.”"

      "Liverpool star Jota, 28, died alongside his 25-year-old brother in a horrific car crash in Spain earlier this month. Their deaths have shocked the footballing world, prompting an outpouring of emotion that has gone well beyond club rivalries.",
      "Both Fernandes and Dalot attended the funerals of their Portuguese compatriots in their homeland on July 5 and were then given additional time off by United. They were part of the Portugal squad, alongside Jota, who won the Nations League, beating Spain on penalties in the final.",
      "They were accompanied by Amorim to lay a wreath with red and white flowers, with a note which read: “Rest in peace, Diogo and Andre. With deepest condolences from everyone at Manchester United.”",
      "Wearing dark clothes, the trio added the United wreath to the masses of flowers and mementos that have been left by Liverpool fans and members of the public outside Anfield.",
      "It comes after Liverpool played their first game since the tragic news, facing Preston in a pre-season friendly at Deepdale. The Reds, who have retired Jota’s No.20 shirt number, won the game on Sunday 3-1 thanks to goals from Conor Bradley, Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo amid emotional scenes.",
      "\"Nothing seems to be important if we think of what has happened,\" said Slot ahead of the game. \"But we are a football club and we need to train and we need to play again, if we want it or not.",

What is appropriate [for] what we have to say? Can we train again? Can we laugh again? Can we be angry if there’s a wrong decision?",

      "Amorim could only guide his side to 15th in the table last season, and will be pleased to have some extensive time to work with his players and to implement his tactics without interruption. United are already a week into their work and new signing Matheus Cunha has participated in his first session at at Carrington.",
      "Work and testing has been conducted in the gym and the training pitch has seen its first action before the club's summer tour begins. Leeds United await in Stockholm before Amorim's squad takes off to the United States to take on West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",

      "Not exactly part of Amorim's remit, but the Portuguese coach wanted the club's hierarchy to have his squad in place in time for the pre-season tour. The 40-year-old sees the period as an important opportunity for players to integrate into the group and to take on board his methods.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's arrival would see another goalscoring threat added to United's forward line. Brentford are still awaiting a third bid from United and the Red Devils can make no mistake if they do not want to have a detrimenal impact on Amorim's plans.",
      "The possibility of signing a new goalkeeper has long been anticipated at Old Trafford but with the injury of Andre Onana has taken on greater significance. Back-up option Altay Bayindir's future must be decided, and Amorim must choose who he trusts to start in goal with Onana potentially missing the start of the season.",

Pre-season is about building momentum after all, rather than putting people's noses out of joint.",
      "It could also provide an opportunity for some of the club's young talent to leave an impression. That could include defender Godwill Kukonki, who is set to sign his first professional deal, and Leeds could provide a testing ground to make such decisions.",
      "Amorim will also be tasked with boosting the confidence of his stars, to instill the belief required to go on and have a better season. That will be true for nobody more than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Denmark international is often at the brunt of criticism for United's goalscoring failures and has needed to endure constant links away from the club as well as speculation of transfers for new forwards. As it stands, the young star remains United's most senior out-and-out forward and Amorim must attempt to unleash his talents, with the addition of Cunha perhaps taking some of the burden from the striker's shoulders.",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is attempting to bring Victor Lindelof to Serie A side Fiorentina following his release from Old Trafford, reports claim.",
      "Defender Lindelof was released by United boss Ruben Amorim at the end of last season following eight seasons with the club.",
      "He still managed 25 appearances in all competitions for the Red Devils last season but only started six times in the Premier League, signalling the end of his time in Manchester.",
      "Lindelof proved to be a valuable member of the United squad during his spell as he made 284 appearances and won two trophies.",
      "The 30-year-old will now be looking ahead to his next chapter after becoming a free agent and Fiorentina have become an option for him.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, Lindelof's former United team-mate is \"pushing\" to bring the centre-back to the Viola.",
      "The pair spent six years together at United and De Gea's involvement in the deal comes after he himself revitalised his career after joining the club - playing 42 times for the team and making some fabulous saves.",
      "The report says Fiorentina are ready to offer Lindelof a contract at the club, knowing he can be snapped up for free.",
      "It adds that the club feel the Sweden star would offer \"valuable experience\" as well as back-up following the exits of Matias Moreno and Nicolas Valentini.",
      "Should Lindelof join the club, he will be playing in the UEFA Conference League after the club finished sixth in Serie A last season.",
      "Along with De Gea, Lindelof would also be playing alongside former Manchester City forward Edin Dzeko and ex-Everton star Moises Kean.",
      "Lindelof was one of three senior players who were released by Manchester United at the end of the campaign, including Christian Eriksen and Jonny Evans.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Markus Babbel believes Florian Wirtz is the signing of the summer, despite the enormous fee it took to prise him away from Bayer Leverkusen. The Reds stunned the Premier League and the rest of Europe when they bagged the much-coveted German superstar.",
      "The Premier League champions were eager to make a statement after sealing their 20th top-flight crown and so pulled out all the stops to seal a deal for the ambitious 22-year-old.",
      "After months of speculation, and fighting off the likes of Bayern Munich and Manchester City to land his signature, Wirtz joined Liverpool last month in a deal that could be worth a British-record fee of £116 million.",
      "Babbel, 52, is a former Germany international, who played for Liverpool from 2000-2004 and helped the Anfield side under the late Gerard Houllier win four major trophies.",
      "Despite the eye-watering fee, the four-time Bundesliga champion believes the deal represents excellent value for his former club due to the Wirtz's clear class - claiming that even if Liverpool's bitter rivals Manchester United signed the playmaker, he would still echo the same sentiments.",
      "\"Florian Wirtz is easily the best signing of the summer transfer window so far,\" Babbel told Gameshub. “That was the deal of the year in my opinion and that isn’t just because the Premier League champions signed him; if Man United had made the deal, it would be no different – he’s a fantastic player that will add so much value to the team.",
      "\"No one was talking about Liverpool getting the deal done either! Everyone assumed he’d join Bayern Munich, Man City or Real Madrid. But it was always clear to me from the start that he’d be heading to Liverpool to play under Arne Slot and alongside some of the best players in Europe, such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah.\"",
      "He added: \"I would be surprised if a club managed to pull off a signing as good as Wirtz to Liverpool. For me, there’s no doubt that he’s the best signing of the window.\"",
      "In the five years Wirtz spent at Leverkusen, the Germany international established himself as one of the best players in the world, hence the huge fee paid for his services by Arne Slot's side.",
      "Speaking after his unveiling as the Reds' record signing, Wirtz opened up on the high-profile move. \"I would like to win everything every year,\" he said.",
      "\"In the end, we want to be successful. Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I’m really ambitious.\"",

So, attacking reinforcements may be top of the club's list when spending commences, with only youngster Zepiqueno Redmond signed so far, and a surprise target has emerged in the form of Barcelona's Ferran Torres.",

      "With Jhon Duran sold in January, Villa favourite Ollie Watkins led the line for most of the season and mustered 16 league goals, an impressive total despite being three less than he managed the previous term.",

      "While his finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, the ground he covers not just through the centre but also out wide is vital to Villa's play. With no Rashford to force him onto the bench, he could string together some impressive performances next season in Europe and domestically, while replacing him with an unknown entity could hinder what is a vital campaign.",

      "While all of the above have been intentionally insulting, Manchester City can be slightly excused here on the basis that they accidentally bid £30m for Lionel Messi. Although it does make it all the more embarrassing on their part.",
      "Former City executive Garry Cook explained the mix-up in ‘The Manchester City Years’ by Gary James. Sheikh Mansour had just completed his £210m takeover of the club in August 2009, with chiefs – located in Manchester, London and Abu Dhabi – scrambling to sign a forward before the window slammed shut.",
      "After failed swoops for Fernando Torres and Dimitar Berbatov, Cook explained: “He (an executive) made a comment like, ‘It’s all getting messy.’ Via the telephones and other communication lines, this somehow translated into, ‘Get Messi.’ An offer was made for Lionel Messi of about £30million. Needless to say, it was rejected.”",
      "Cherry picking a relegated club's top talent is always a fun exercise for the Premier League's big boys, who know full well the selling club are bent over a barrel. But there's still a line – and Spurs well and truly crossed that two years ago.",
      "Leicester City had one of the most stacked squads a relegated Premier League team has ever seen, and James Maddison and Harvey Barnes were both destined for big moves. £50m for both of them, however, was never going to fly.",
      "Maddison did end up signing on the ever-shameless Daniel Levy's dotted line, but he cost £40m alone, while Newcastle signed Barnes for £38m. Hey, you were nearly two thirds of the way there lads.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Arsenal have not been shy in attempting to overcome their deficiencies. They've signed Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard in the last week, while Noni Madueke looks to be next to join the club from Chelsea. They also want Viktor Gyokeres, who is doing everything he can to get out of Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Manchester United continue to graft and are doing everything they can to land Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford having made just one summer signing so far. The future of Marcus Rashford also continues to be a major discussion point.",
      "Liverpool, after landing the likes of Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, are still eyeing up a move for Crystal Palace skipper Marc Guehi, whose contract with the Eagles is winding down.",
      "Stay with as and we'll keep you up to date with everything from around the Premier League and beyond.",

      "The veteran midfielder has signed a one-year deal with the Italian giants, with the option of a further 12 months.",
      "The 39-year-old left Real Madrid after 13 years earlier in the summer and will continue his stellar career with Milan.",
      "Arsenal will reportedly be happy to sell Leandro Trossard once they get Noni Madueke signed.",
      "The Times says that Trossard could be sold to Fenerbahce for £20million once Madueke is official. Madueke has been undergoing a medical at Arsenal today ahead of a £52m move from Chelsea and that makes Trossard surplus to requirements.",
      "He has already apparently agreed personal terms with the Turkish side, having spoken to Jose Mourinho, and could leave after 28 goals in 124 appearances for Arsenal.",
      "The Magpies have held meetings with Frankfurt over the past week and have now met again in Austria, where they are on a pre-season camp.",

      "The 22-year-old left-back went on loan to Benfica and impressed so much they made it permanent. United had a buy-back clause, but have decided not to use it, allowing him to sign a six-year deal with Real, where he previously spent time as a youngster.",
      "Fulham and Besiktas are among the clubs interested in signing Inter Milan striker Mehdi Taremi, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Taremi only joined Inter last summer on a free transfer from Porto, but has struggled at Inter and wants out.",

      "Luis Diaz has been continually linked with a move away from Liverpool this summer – and we’ve continually been told that the club are not looking to sell. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are both interested in the Colombia international winger.",
      "There’s also interest from Saudi Arabia, with Al-Nassr in the picture, but that seems the most unlikely exit route. The Reds have previously made it clear that Diaz isn’t for sale for any price, but Football Insider say that £69m (€80m) would do the trick.",
      "That can be viewed two ways: as encouraging bids, or as setting the price so high so as to make a deal unrealistic. It’s said that Bayern won’t go above £51m (€60m), so it could well be the latter, although there is still plenty of time until the window closes on September 1.",
      "Massimo Luongo has been training with Millwall in a bid to try and win a contract with the Championship club after leaving Ipswich Town.",
      "The Australian midfielder, 32, would bring a wealth of experience to the Lions' engine room following the departures of George Saville and George Honeyman.",

      "The player, speaking to media in South Korea, has already explained why he chose to join Excelsior.",
      "He said: \"Brighton’s loan coordinator recommended several teams to me and told me that my happiness should come first, no matter which one I choose. I had meetings with a number of clubs in the Dutch league, but I got a really good feeling from Excelsior’s manager [Ruben den Uil] so I decided to go there.”",
      "The 18-year-old attacker joined Brighton from Daejeon Hana Citizen in March after also attracting interest from Aston Villa.",

      "Tottenham are interested in Maxime Esteve, according to Football Insider, despite his hefty price tag.",
      "The 23-year-old was crucial to Burnley last term as the Clarets were promoted back to the Premier League, owing largely to a record-breaking defence that was rarely breached.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has turned down the chance to join his idol and former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr, according to the Telegraph.",
      "Garnacho has been told to find a new club this summer and was approached by Al-Nassr. However, the 21-year-old has rebuffed their interest as he would prefer to join another European club.",
      "Liverpool are willing to offer Ibrahima Konate to Real Madrid in a deal to sign Rodrygo, according to reports in Spain. The defender, who has one year remaining on his contract, has been linked with a move to Los Blancos with his future unresolved at Anfield.",
      "And it appears the Reds are willing to make an offer of France international Konate and a transfer fee in a bid to lure Rodrygo to Merseyside. Liverpool are prepared to stump up £30.2m in addition to Konate it is said.",

      "The Palace captain was at the centre of the club's new kit launch suggesting an exit is not imminent however.",
      "Marcus Rashford has reportedly turned down a hugely lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia because he only has eyes for Barcelona. Rashford is in the wilderness in the summer transfer window, having been told he doesn’t feature in Ruben Amorim’s plans at Man Utd, but without an exit route lined up.",
      "Rashford has made it clear that he is keen to join Barcelona ever since concluding a long spell at Aston Villa. While his brief loan spell at Villa ended in injury, Rashford still managed to revitalise his career with four goals and six assists in 17 appearances."

      "Manchester United's transfer business has firmly stalled with Matheus Cunha still their only major summer signing after he joined from Wolves for just over £60million earlier in the summer.",
      "Their attention is now on Bryan Mbeumo, who has excelled for Brentford, but they've seen two bids for the forward rejected and are yet to return with a third bid. The player himself wants the move but the Bees have not eased off their valuation.",
      "Ruben Amorim also has a number of players whom he needs to either back or more on. The likes of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho all headed out on loan last term but are back at Old Trafford despite not appearing to be part of the plan.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is another man who could be on his way out as the club look to bolster their funds with a No 9 thought to be on their shopping list. A dire Premier League underlined the need to change the look of the squad and here's the latest news coming out of Manchester.",
      "Mbeumo has liked Leny Yoro's Instagram post after he confirmed his return to United training in what is the latest hint that he's keen on making the switch.",
      "The Cameroonian has made no secret of his desire to move on and take up the opportunity at the Premier League giants, who are trying to land more firepower in a bid to get them back up the table. His latest move on Instagram has appeared to underline his motivation to move on.",
      "He liked Yoro's post despite the pair having no prior involvement as team-mates. The Frenchman put up a post that read: \"ReUnited\" alongside an image of him going through his paces and Mbeumo was among those to like the post, along with current Old Trafford stars Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot.",
      "United's summer business is being aided by the millions they are receiving from sell-on fees they previously included in deals with Alvaro Carreras - who never played a game for the club - due to bank them more than £7m.",
      "Newcastle have just signed Antony Elanga from Nottingham Forest, which has cost the Magpies £55m. As per the clauses inserted in the deal that took Elanga from Manchester to Nottingham, United will land 15 percent of profit on any deal. Given he moved for £55m, United are said to have picked up around £6m of the fee, reports The Telegraph.",
      "Former United left back Carreras is set to land them even more cash as he is on the verge of leaving Benfica to join Real Madrid for around £43m after an impressive year in Lisbon. He moved to Portugal 12 months ago for around £7m, which means Benfica will pocket around £36m of profit. 20 percent of that - £7.2m - will go to United and further bolster their summer budget.",
      "Juventus have agreed a £17.3m deal with United for Jadon Sancho as the player looks for a way out of Old Trafford following Chelsea's decision to send him back after his loan move.",
      "According to La Stampa the Red Devils were holding out for closer to £25m for the former Borussia Dortmund man, who cost them £70m back in 2021, but have decided to ease on their demands in a bid to get the flop out the door.",
      "Sancho refused to budge on his £350,000-a-week wage when Chelsea considered signing him, meaning they pulled out of a deal as they refused to pay that much. His salary could still prove a major sticking point when it comes to negotiations with Juventus.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres went viral in that competition with four goals against Manchester City and was always likely to stay in it. He will with Arsenal, and suddenly the number of out-and-out attainable stellar strikers is scant.",
      "Another, Victor Osimhen, is pricing himself out of a move to an elite league. If Alexander Isak goes, it will not be to United. Harry Kane isn't going anywhere. Erling Haaland is the (blue) moon to United.",
      "Haaland and Kane are cause for great regret. United missed out on the former in December 2019 and did not have the nerve to go for the latter two years ago. Since Haaland moved to Borussia Dortmund, the only reputable strikers United have bought were Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, aged 33 and 36 at the time of their arrivals. Each only cut it for one season.",
      "Now United are at risk of settling for potential when they require a proven commodity. Hugo Ekitike, of Eintracht Frankfurt, is hardly a spring chicken - he is older than Rasmus Hojlund - but not the ideal profile and seemingly bound for Newcastle United anyway.",
      "United have still not concluded a deal for the Premier League's joint-fourth highest scorer last season, Bryan Mbeumo. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha claimed 35 league goals between them last season but woe betide United if they rewrite the script and attempt to rebrand either of them as a specialist striker.",
      "Perhaps it should be a task for anyone who applies for the new director of communications role United have advertised for. \"Cunha has experience of playing up front, Mbeumo regularly played there for Brentford and their goalscoring records last season speak volumes.",
      "\"We invested in a long-term project with Rasmus and continue to back him - there have been glimpses of his class. And Josh has become a fan favourite.\" You can imagine hearing a pundit utter that on MUTV.",
      "United can't pull the wool over sensible supporters' eyes. The Delap approach is concrete proof they want a recognisable No.9. United aimed to come out of the blocks with two deals - Cunha and Delap - before their post-season tour had concluded.",
      "Club sources stressed shortly after Delap chose Chelsea that they had contingency targets. That was six weeks ago. United host Arsenal in their opening fixture in 34 days.",
      "Ruben Amorim will crouch down on his haunches in the technical area and see Gyokeres hovering around the centre circle at kick-off. But a cannon will be stitched to his shirt, rather than a devil.",
      "Gyokeres would have been preferable to Delap yet there was a bright red flag: a manager reuniting with a player who conquered a league that is teeming with fodder.",
      "There are not many strikers who fit the bill.",
      "HE-SAID-SHE-SAID",
      "Some of Marcus Rashford’s acolytes were keen to stress last week that he had not asked to leave United. He did not have to.",
      "Rashford said he was \"ready for a new challenge\" back in December. Rashford said last month he would like to play for Barcelona. No clarification was required.",
      "We can do without the he-said-she-said nonsense regarding a player’s future. United do not miss treading on eggshells around Rashford and Amorim acted decisively after Rashford blanked him in Plzen on December 12.",
      "He is a player without a number now that Cunha has the '10'. United are still remaining diplomatic with Rashford and have emphasised his 20-year history with the club. That privilege has not been extended to Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Rashford jeopardised the harmony of the United squad too often: the brazen birthday party on Deansgate, the Belfast bender and the Plzen flashpoint. Ahead of a new season, United must have a happy camp.",
      "Rashford arrived for an individual training session at Carrington eight minutes after Amorim on Friday via the rear entrance. Amorim left through the front.",
      "Jadon Sancho would have also threatened the mood. He refused to apologise to Erik ten Hag after accusing him of lying and revelled in Rashford’s loan move to Aston Villa with that petulant “Freedom” comment in February.",
      "Sancho has the freedom of movement to find himself a new club, most likely in Italy, a dumping ground for Premier League clubs for several years. Chelsea opted to buy Jamie Gittens, another winger bred in the Manchester City academy who defected to Borussia Dortmund, rather than Sancho. Gittens is five years Sancho's junior.",
      "Ten Hag was ordered to briefly reintegrate Sancho last summer, without the desired apology. He managed the situation respectably and United got Sancho out of the door on transfer deadline day.",
      "Yet the sight of Sancho back in a United shirt was a call effectively made by those above Ten Hag. His authority, already shrivelling, eroded a little more with Sancho on the plane to the United States for the pre-season tour.",
      "The incumbent United manager still has total authority. That is the way it should be."

      "Darren Fletcher has occupied four roles within six years at Manchester United: ambassador, technical director, first team coach and now under 18s coach.",
      "Fletcher was a conduit between the academy and the first team for several years, recommending which teenagers were suitable for first-team training on an ad hoc basis if a player was injured or the squad was depleted amid internationals.",
      "He is a regular at Leigh Sports Village and was one of the few senior figures in attendance for United's high-profile FA Youth Cup ties against Chelsea, Arsenal and Aston Villa last season.",
      "Fletcher, 41, had a 20-year association with United as a player and has been a full-time staff member for four-and-a-half years. He is eminently suitable for his first managerial role on the basis of his playing and coaching experiences at the club.",
      "Beyond that, Fletcher is approachable, articulate and likeable. He will be an invaluable sounding board for young players who are sidelined for an inordinate period, having recovered from a debilitating case of ulcerative colitis that wiped a year off his career.",
      "Fletcher's twin sons, Jack and Tyler, defected from the Manchester City academy to United's in 2023 but they are now ineligible to feature for the under 18s, which partly influenced their father's decision to take charge.",
      "Fletcher took a back seat as Jack and Tyler mulled over their futures two years ago and which national side to represent. Jack chose England and Tyler is a Scotland youth international.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson had recommended Fletcher to replace Nick Cox as the director of academy but Fletcher's long-term ambition is to become a first team manager. This move should strengthen his CV. Kieran McKenna, now Ipswich Town manager, was the United U18 coach before Jose Mourinho promoted him to the first team dugout in 2016.",
      "Fletcher is due to work closely with Travis Binnion, the head of player development and coaching who oversees the under 21s. United have also allocated Fletcher a key leadership role in the academy that will oversee all of the age groups.",
      "United maintain the priority with academy talents will be player development and not results."

      "In terms of other potential new signings, there is still nothing more concrete to mention on the rumour mill. United have been heavily linked with signing a striker, but after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres it remains to be seen where they will go next.",
      "There have also been reports that United could sign a new goalkeeper this summer amid speculation around Andre Onana's future. Aston Villa shot-stopper Emi Martinez has been linked with United in recent weeks, but the possibility of a move remains a rumour at this stage.",
      "United could see some players leave the club over the next week, both on permanent deals and on a loan basis. Marcus Rashford is being heavily linked with a move away from United with some suggestions that a loan deal to Barcelona may be on the cards.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is also a player who could leave United this summer, with the Argentina international joining Rashford in training away from the rest of the first-team squad at Carrington last week.",
      "United could also see Antony and Jadon Sancho leave the club this summer on permanent deals after their loan deals last season. Whether any moves could happen this week remains to be seen, but it would not be a shock to see deals speed up now that clubs are returning for pre-season training."

      "Manchester United find themselves in an undesirable position at this current stage of the summer transfer window. With just five weeks until the 2025/26 season, frustrations has set in.",
      "Following their worst season in 51 years that culminated with a lacklustre Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, United were destined for a busy transfer window involving a number of incomings and certain players being sold.",
      "Like every single summer, United have been, or not been, involved in a rather busy period full of speculation and stories linking them with over a hundred players. However, Jadon Wilcox has only managed to sign one player in Matheus Cunha.",
      "His £62.5million release clause was triggered early in the window and he became signing number one. It then became apparent that Bryan Mbeumo was the club's number one target after Cunha with the Brentford star viewed as the perfect partner for the Brazilian.",
      "The Reds opened talks with their Premier League rivals at the start of June and an opening bid worth £55million was rejected. Another offer of £60m then fell short. After a month of very gradual talks, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player and United are not yet to match the Bees' valuation, believed to be around £65m.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Mbeumo is expected to arrive at United this week. It comes after reports last week that the 25-year-old was growing frustrated at the lack of progress. And it seems as though Ruben Amorim is also becoming agitated.",
      "The Mirror have claimed that the United boss wants a deal for Mbeumo finalised before the clubs jet off to the pre-season for the United States on July 22. The Reds face Premier League rivals West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton before returning to the United Kingdom to face Fiorentina.",
      "At the start of the window, it was understood that United wanted Cunha, Mbeumo and a striker signed ready for the pre-season tour. Last summer, United didn't add Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui to Erik ten Hag's squad until August. That didn't work out.",
      "A deadline of getting Mbeumo through the door is a clear message from Amorim. Failure to bring the forward to the club, to allow him time to settle in his new team, would be a major problem.",
      "The additional stress of Amorim also being without a striker is making the matter worse. Unlike their Premier League rivals, United are going into the main part of their pre-season tour without having the bulk of their transfer business done."

      "In two seasons in Portugal, the 27-year-old has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances. However, United haven't been alone in the race to sign him and it now looks like Arsenal will bolster their centre-forward ranks.",
      "The Gunners have been heavily linked with the striker for some time and their interest dates back further than United's. Mikel Arteta is desperate to strengthen his attack after the lack of a centre-forward played a big part in his side missing out on the Premier League title.",
      "After agreeing a five-year contract with Gyokeres and his camp, the north Londoners now look to have finally agreed a deal with Sporting CP to get their man. The Athletic have reported that Arsenal are now taking the final steps in negotiations with the Portuguese champions and are processing to get the deal done.",
      "Up until now, talks have been delayed by Sporting's president Frederico Varandas seemingly refusing to see out the gentleman's agreement to allow him to depart for around £59million.",
      "Now, the Premier League side have made 'formal advances' over terms to close the deal. It's said negotiations were reignited earlier this weekend and the communication between the two parties has improved.",
      "The deal will leave United at square one in their bid to sign a centre-forward. With Gyokeres moving to the Emirates Stadium and Victor Osimhen the subject of strong interest from Galatasaray, Amorim is faced with the reality of exploring alternatives."

      "Since Manchester United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham on May 21, talk has materialised day-by-day calling for a desperate overhaul of the playing squad.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first 'phase' at Old Trafford has been faced with countless problems ranging from player fall-out, disappointing results and now a lack of some much-needed transfer business.",
      "So far, United have bought just Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian's £62.5million release clause was triggered at the start of June and he's already been introduced to his teammates at Carrington. But, despite Amorim admitting a number of times that his team requires attention, United have not yet acted.",
      "Their interest in Bryan Mbeumo has been ongoing for well over a month now with two bids turned down by Brentford. Any hope that the 25-year-old would be part of United's pre-season squad have rapidly dwindled and the apparent lack of a third offer has cast doubts over an actual deal happening.",
      "Whilst the main focus for Jason Wilcox and the recruitment team at United is to sign Mbeumo sooner rather than later, the Reds have other positions that need strengthening. One of them areas at centre-forward with United expected to sign a striker with better goalscoring prowess than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "However, a new midfielder has also been tipped to come in. Amorin's dream front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and a striker means Bruno Fernandes is expected to be play in one of the two central midfielder spots. One issue Amorim has, though, is that there isn't an obvious candidate to partner him.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro both featured heavily for United last term with Kobbie Mainoo's season being stagnated by injuries. The likes of Ederson, Wilfried Ndidi and Douglas Luiz have all been linked with coming to the club but Palmeiras' Richard Rios is a name that doesn't seem to be fading from United's catalogue of reported transfer targets.",
      "Rios has flourished at the Brazilian outfit and is one of the many players to come away from the Club World Cup with a glowing reputation. The box-to-box midfielder has been mentioned for a couple of weeks now but reports in Italy have suggested that United have finally entered the race.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has claimed that the Reds have stepped up their interest in the 25-year-old and have taken 'concrete steps' towards signing him. Roma have recently failed with a £22m bid for the Colombian, falling short of Palmeiras' £26m asking price.",
      "It leaves the door open for United to swoop in and add him to Amorim's squad. Many may question the Reds' need for a midfielder of Rios' profile but having an energetic character alongside a technician and creator like Fernandes could be a perfect piece of United's puzzle.",
      "Heavy emphasis is on the two wing-backs in Amorim's system. Getting Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, or Amad, wide and forward is pivotal to United gaining success. The problem they've had at times is that the lack of energy and connection in the middle of the park has left them short when wing-backs go forward.",
      "Rios' arrival wouldn't guarantee an immediate starting place at Old Trafford. However, there is reason for the energetic and combative midfielder to be signed. Not only would he add the liveliness required to free Fernandes to pull the string in the final third, but he would provide the defensive stability to allow the wing-backs to stretch the pitch and cause havoc out wide."

      "Chelsea continue to be tempted by Alejandro Garnacho, while a European club is sat by the phone in the coming hours waiting for Manchester United to call…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) Moise Kean – Fiorentina to Manchester United\nThere is a belief, apparently, at Fiorentina that United could trigger the £45million release clause which is active until Tuesday. Bless ’em.",
      "",
      "19) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nReports over the weekend suggested Bayern had made a £45million bid for a player who seems quite keen to move. But Liverpool are either serious when they say he’s not for sale, or they’re intent on driving the hardest of bargains.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThere has been speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao but the Porto winger’s release clause is about to go up by 50%, so we ought to see some clarity soon if Juve are serious about Sancho. And, perhaps more importantly, how serious Sancho is about Juve and kickstarting his tail-spinning career.",
      "",
      "17) Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United. But reports suggest Milan might be a problem for the Red Devils.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s gotta go somewhere…",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to West Ham\nThe Hammers seem keen to put some of their Kudus cash into luring Elliott away from Liverpool but it is so far unclear what the Reds would accept. The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there.",
      "9) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who could yet be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. But reports over the weekend suggest the Serie A champions have backed away somewhat, preferring instead a £30million deal for Udinese’s Lorenzo Lucca. It could all be part of the transfer dance if Napoli are looking for a sweeter deal from Liverpool, but this certainly doesn;t appear as advanced as it did last week.",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited remain in talks with Brentford and they are, apparently, hopeful of getting a deal done before the end of the week. We’ve heard that once, probably twice, already. United fly off to the United States in a week and Ruben Amorim wants Mbeumo on board.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Marco Bizot – Brest to Aston Villa\nThe once-capped Netherlands international keeper is in Birmingham to complete a move to Villa. We assume to serve as Emi Martinez’s understudy but it remains possible the Argentina World Cup winner could be on his way before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nBournemouth have agreed to take another Chelsea keeper, this time permanently, with the 25-year-old moving for £25million. Petrovic will have a medical once Chelsea fly back from the United States.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "2) Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger is at Arsenal today to wrap up a medical and the final details of a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "The Red Devils are looking to raise funds in order to bring in more players this summer with Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha – who joined in a £62.5m deal from Wolves – their only major signing of the summer with youngster Diego Leon also joining from Cerro Porteno.",

Man Utd have delayed their return date until later in July to allow them time to explore solutions further.’",

      "The report reads: ‘At this point, the situation is tightening. Kean never accepted Al-Qadsiah’s offer, nor did he comment on Al-Hilal’s interest, which had contacted his entourage in recent days. Manchester United’s prospect should not be underestimated, as the Red Devils could make a move for the 2000-born player during the final hours of his release clause.’",
      "Man Utd legend Wes Brown thinks the players who are going to be part of Amorim’s squad again next season need to cut out “individual mistakes” to be successful next term.",
      "When asked if there’s a limit to what Amorim can do without major reinforcements, Brown said: “Last season, Man United struggled with concentration and doing the basics at times, which led to individual mistakes, which led to conceding preventable goals and losing winnable games.",
      "“There’s not a lot the manager can do about that, he can only set the team up for success, and then the players must go out and perform to get positive results.",
      "“At times last season, I think the pressure got to the players. They were playing a new formation and losing games, so the pressure was mounting on them all the time.",
      "“The expectation of playing for Man United can weigh heavily at times, and the players found that out last season. It is up to the manager in those moments to recognise it and pump the players full of confidence, but if they are losing games, that is hard to do.",
      "“However, they have all that experience now. They can use last season’s tough times to get them through next season’s tough times, so I do expect them to improve next year as a team. However, if the mistakes are still happening regularly, teams will punish you in the Premier League and results will be hard to come by.”",
      "According to reports, four reasons are behind Arsenal’s decision to sign Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres over RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Arsenal gave up on Benjamin Sesko to opt for Viktor Gyokeres over the lack of reasonable negotiation from RB Leipzig, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal need a striker. Viktor Gyokeres is the standout, but who else is there? From fantasy picks like Isak to the realistic Watkins, we rank 10 options.",
      "According to reports, Leipzig are ‘desperate to sell’ Benjamin Sesko to Arsenal, while another Gunners striker target ‘likes the idea of living in London’.",

      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",

      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",

      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",

      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",

Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",

Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",

      "",
      "10=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",

      "7=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",

      "",
      "7=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "3) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal supporters have lost it over the £50m+ signing of Noni Madueke, but here are six times Mikel Arteta has made angry fans look foolish.",
      "Arsenal have been handed a huge transfer boost in their pursuit of Real Madrid winger Rodrygo despite interest from PSG, according to reports.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided a strict deadline for when he wants a deal for Viktor Gyokeres wrapped up, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are closing in on the signing of centre-back Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia, according to reports.",
      "A pair of Premier League rivals are moving closer to a transfer deal for an England international, according to reports."

      "According to reports, Manchester United are being ‘sued’ by an ex-player, who has decided to ‘lodge a legal claim’ over ‘clinical negligence’.",
      "Just when you thought that matters could not get worse for Man Utd…",
      "United’s issues off the pitch have had a knock-on effect on team performances, with the Premier League giants stooping to an embarrassing new low during the 2024/25 campaign despite sitting second in our net spend table.",

      "With the Red Devils struggling to offload their unwanted talents, including Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho, they have only made two summer signings, landing Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon for around £65m combined.",
      "Now, the Red Devils are faced with a legal battle involving former defender Axel Tuanzebe.",
      "The 27-year-old progressed through the ranks at Man Utd and was touted as a future star, but he only made 37 senior appearances for his boyhood club before leaving as he was dogged by injuries.",
      "After having loan stints at Aston Villa, Napoli and Stoke City, Tuanzebe left permanently during the 2023 summer transfer window to join Ipswich Town.",
      "The versatile defender made 45 appearances over two seasons for Ipswich and has recently joined newly-promoted Burnley on a free transfer.",
      "And it’s now emerged that Tuanzebe, as revealed by The Telegraph, is ‘suing’ Man Utd for ‘clinical negligence’, accusing the club of derailing his career with poor ‘medical advice’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Telegraph Sport can reveal that the 27-year-old, who left United two years ago when his contract expired, has lodged a legal claim at the High Court.",
      "‘Lawyers for Tuanzebe declined to comment on the action brought by a player.’",
      "Man Utd were ‘approached for comment on the filed lawsuit’ but are yet to respond after they posted a heartfelt tribute to Tuanzebe after he left the club in 2023.",
      "They said: “His departure is an emotional one for the player and many at the club who have known and helped nurture him over the years. A fine character, he leaves United universally respected as a credit to himself and his family.",
      "“Everyone at the club would like to extend our best wishes to Axel as he embarks upon the next chapter of his career. We would also like to thank him for always representing Manchester United with class and dignity.”"

      "Given the terrible season Man Utd had last term, finishing 15th in the Premier League, the Red Devils supporters would have hoped for a few more signings through the door by mid-July.",

      "While they are also trying to agree a fee with Brentford for Mbeumo with Man Utd having two bids turned down as talks continue this week.",
      "In an update on a deal, Romano said on his YouTube channel over the weekend: “I can guarantee to you again this week, Man United, fully focused on Bryan Mbeumo deal with Brentford, with conversations still underway, with Man United’s absolute focus being on Mbeumo, with a player still waiting for Manchester United as a top priority.",

There is still an agreement to reach with Brentford, but I’m told that the conversations are ongoing to try to reach this agreement and let the player travel and complete his move. So Man United keep working on Bryan Mbeumo as absolute priority.”",
      "Before he added on Sunday: “The contacts are still ongoing between United, Brentford, people involved in the deal. Mbeumo still wants to go to Manchester United, and the club maintains their confidence, their optimism, to get the green light and sign Bryan Mbeumo in the next days.",
      "“So still no breakthrough in this story as of tonight but Manchester United keep advancing to find the right structure for the deal. They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",
      "And Man Utd are already lining up their next two deals too, if reports are to be believed, with Palmeiras Online claiming that the Red Devils are ‘preparing an offer’ of £26m for Richard Rios after watching the Colombian play for the Brazilian side at the Club World Cup.",

      "And while it is also pointed out that there is ‘internal frustration that no attackers have been moved on’, the goalkeeper situation has ‘taken a fresh hit’.",
      "The report claims:",

      "‘United were open to offers for Onana in the window, and although there were conversations with intermediaries, no concrete bids have arrived. Onana’s camp made it known that he was not actively seeking a move, and that has complicated matters further. Ideally, Amorim would have replaced him, but if not, the plan was always to bring in a goalkeeper to compete with Onana. That remains the case.’",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’.",
      "That an access-all-areas documentary about Man Utd next season was given the consideration it was shows again the size of the job before Ruben Amorim…",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has ruled out a move from Man Utd to “hijack” Galatasaray’s deal for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Red Devils have only made one major signing this summer with Matheus Cunha joining from Wolves in a deal worth £62.5m, while youngster Diego Leon also arrived from Cerro Porteno.",
      "Man Utd have also been bidding for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo but the Bees are holding firm on their £70m valuation of the player.",
      "In an update over the weekend, Romano said of the Red Devils’ chase for Mbeumo: “I can guarantee to you again this week, Man United, fully focused on Bryan Mbeumo deal with Brentford, with conversations still underway, with Man United’s absolute focus being on Mbeumo, with a player still waiting for Manchester United as a top priority.",
      "“So they keep advancing. They keep working on this deal for Mbeumo. There is still an agreement to reach with Brentford, but I’m told that the conversations are ongoing to try to reach this agreement and let the player travel and complete his move. So Man United keep working on Bryan Mbeumo as absolute priority.”",
      "Man Utd are also keen to bring in a new centre-forward this summer with numerous names linked, including Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres, who is on the verge of signing for Arsenal.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour ranking: Man Utd to get top striker for free? Forest fuming over leak",
      "Napoli striker Osimhen – who spent last season on loan at Turkish giants Galatasaray – is available this summer with Man Utd heavily linked to the Nigeria international, as well as other Premier League sides.",
      "It now looks almost certain that Osimhen will join up with Galatasaray on a permanent basis this summer despite a report in recent days that Man Utd could still look to hijack a deal worth €75m (£65m).",
      "Responding to rumours of a potential Man Utd hijack, Romano revealed on his YouTube channel: “Reports about Man Utd hijacking the deal of Galatasaray from Victor Osimhen, from what I’m told, this is not true.",
      "“Osimhen is getting closer to joining Galatasaray. €75m deal. Now, Napoli have to give final approval. Galatasaray are getting closer after always being confident about signing Osimhen.",
      "“New contacts will take place in the new week. Man Utd are not part of this story, not part of this conversation, also because Galatasaray will give Osimhen an important salary – €16m/season.",
      "“Man Utd were never going to be at the table for those numbers in terms of salary. Forget about the hijack.”",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have reached a ‘verbal agreement’ for another signing, with Fabrizio Romano claiming a ‘medical’ could soon take place.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres’ agents have ‘landed in London’ as they look to seal the final details of a move to Arsenal, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Man Utd are racing Everton to the signing of Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi in a potential £9m deal, according to reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insists there is “nothing at this stage” between Tottenham defender Cristian Romero and Atletico Madrid.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting three central midfielders as their ‘next priority’ if and when they finally complete a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Arsenal have announced that they have completed their third summer signing, while Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that another transfer is “absolutely on”."

      "It’s money month, the time of year when the season sort of starts again with friendlies and fake tournaments, but not really. It’s also a despicable time when the ugliness of top-flight football arrogantly bestrides the world in pursuit of tiny amounts of extra money.",
      "If your side does well, it cheers you for the new campaign; a few poor results and everyone is disgruntled. And it usually proves no guide to what happens in the season.",
      "ITV even showed Preston v Liverpool. It still seemed more significant than the CWC obviously, but I seriously wonder about the fitness of footballers who last played internationals a month ago. We’re familiar with player burn-out as a concept, though it’s usually only used as an excuse for defeat, not a reason for victory. You’ve been playing for the best part of 11 months; you’re not going to lose anything in a month that a friendly against Preston would revive. Surely light training is all that’s needed.",
      "Back in the day, the time off would last from mid-May until mid-August, a time which would be spent drinking and eating gravy dinners, so players would need to run up sand dunes – vomiting as Big Jack shouted profanities – to get fit again, but I doubt that’s the case now that they measure everything all the time and they live off chicken and pasta.",
      "I watched Middlesbrough play and lose to Port Clarence Reserves in the 70s, but clubs have now realised there’s money in pre-season games and pretending they’re competitive. So this Saturday you could watch Gateshead v Sunderland or Matlock v Derby or Dartford v Charlton amongst others. I’m not sure anyone except the most loyal obsessive bothered, but it’s a part of a great tradition. And of course bigger clubs are playing in fake tournaments all across the world so they can earn enough to pay for a reserve full-back from Austria.",
      "But then Premier League clubs are different, moral-free beasts with no conscience. The Guardian reckons the 20 clubs are unconscionably taking a planet-breaking 175,000 summer air miles in just a few weeks, the idiots. Manchester United are flying 24,000 miles to show off their mediocrity and are even playing Leeds in Stockholm. City are spending 15,000 miles in the air and face Palermo in Sicily to contest the inaugural Anglo Palermitan Trophy which commemorates the Sicilian club’s maiden fixture against a team of British sailors in 1900. At least they’re used to wasting energy competing in insignificant tournaments. You’re playing for fans in the country you’re flying to, are you? As they die in the heat or are swept away in floods, I’m sure they’ll appreciate it..",
      "Time was they’d play a relatively near lower-league side to help them earn much-needed money from the gate receipts for games that were much in demand. Games like the one v Preston are rare. You can see Liverpool play Milan in Hong Kong though. Or Newcastle play Arsenal in Singapore. No game against Blyth Spartans in Blyth, then? Nah, that’s just legacy thinking.",
      "Personally I loved the pre-season friendly. Boro went through a phase of playing Hibs thanks to Tony Mowbray’s connections and they were always great pish-ups that Hibs certainly took seriously.",
      "There is a better solution, though it would deny these clubs money to fritter away. Scottish football, which I know most of you don’t care about, and to be fair does have the tradition of terrible decisions by the SFA, got it right for once and has had a much better idea with the Premier Sports Cup. The group stage involves 40 clubs – the 37 SPFL clubs for 2025/26 who are not involved in European competition plus Bonnyrigg Rose (relegated to Lowland League), Brora Rangers (Highland League winners) and Brechin City (Highland League runners-up).",
      "Teams are drawn into eight groups of five based on final league positions in 2024/25 and it fires the starting gun on the new season this weekend. They realised that the League Cup retains some credibility so they set up a league stage, where they get to play actual competitive games instead of friendlies and football-starved fans lap it up in the ‘foreign’ July heat, heading towards a final in December.",
      "It is often the one trophy that the Glasgow big two don’t actually always win, though Celtic are the current holders and it has value because of that alone. The CWC has shown the pointlessness of playing in tournaments no one believes in.",
      "Why doesn’t England swallow its ego and copy Scotland instead of treating it like a poor, pish-stinking old relation? It’d get the competition done earlier, providing an early meaningful start to the season. They’re obviously not opposed to playing in July. However, the gate receipts are probably dwarfed by money gained playing in these fake overseas tournaments. So once again, we see how local, domestic football suffers because of the insatiable lust for money, no matter how small, in a way it once never was.",
      "Pre-season pulls back the curtain and shows the most important thing to top clubs. It’s not football or even fitness. It’s just money. Nothing else. The hateful club execs, desperate to justify their lavish wages, just care about money. 175,000 miles. Climate change doesn’t discriminate in favour of football clubs, y’now. You die too. Good luck paying to offset that. And more to the point, you’re effectively killing and ruining the lives of your own fans. Yeah, that makes good economic, if not moral, sense.",
      "Even that doesn’t stop the stupids or deniers. More money, more money, more money. Stop buying players! We’d rather see a local kid come through. No? They’re all crap? Well, that’s down to you. But you’d rather fry in 33 degrees of heat to get one place higher in the league? Morons. It’s 27 degrees here on the west coast of Scotland, it’s unnatural. And when you get skin cancer you can thank the Premier League for not giving a shit and putting a few quid above the health of the planet and its people. F*cking idiots.",
      "So craven for a little bit more money, they are even prepared to exploit not just the Earth but their own assets to the maximum and then some, even at the risk of breaking those same assets, the way they’re breaking the planet. To a rational mind it makes zero sense and is the economics of the madhouse. Protest this obscene situation because they are willingly blind to it. On the contrary, they think they’re clever.",
      "Further down the pyramid, it’s still as it ever was as your local centre-half takes a break from laying bricks to kick your fancy striker up in the air, but it’d be nice if it actually mattered and since they’re already playing, why not? Keep pre-season local.",
      "Does the environment not matter? Obviously not. What a terrible example to future generations who will have to live with and combat their selfishness, if they live at all.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘agreed terms’ for their next summer signing, while one star has been ‘granted approval’ to leave the club.",
      "The Red Devils made a strong start to this summer’s transfer window as they swiftly wrapped up deals for Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, investing around £65m on their first two signings.",
      "However, Man Utd have stuttered in recent weeks as this is partly down to them struggling to offload several big-money outcasts, with Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony still contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side are linked with several potential signings as they require upgrades in most positions after finishing 15th in the Premier League during their trophyless 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Unsurprisingly, their current priority is to overhaul their attack as they struggled to create chances and score goals while adapting to Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 system.",
      "READ: Tough times for Premier League middle-class as old Big Six empire strikes back",
      "The No.10 position is key to this system and Cunha is a clear upgrade on last season’s options, but they remain in the market for another signing in this area and they are targeting Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Mbeumo, like Cunha, was one of the standout forwards in the Premier League last season and he scored 20 goals for Brentford.",
      "The Bees standout is in the final year of his contract, but the London outfit can demand a sizable fee as they have the option to extend his deal on the same terms until 2027.",
      "Man Utd have had a couple of bids rejected for Mbeumo as they have haggled over a price with Brentford, but Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they have ‘agreed terms’ with their Premier League rivals over Mbeumo.",
      "The report claims the Red Devils are ‘very close to a major deal’ for Mbeumo, as they have ‘accepted’ Brentford’s £65m fee for the forward.",
      "This is while Man Utd defender Tyrell Malacia has been ‘granted approval’ to leave, with Football Insider’s Pete O’Rourke reporting that he ‘could join’ Celtic this summer.",
      "However, it is noted that the Red Devils need to make a ‘compromise’ to force through his exit as they would need to ‘subsidise his wages’ to seal a deal with Celtic.",
      "O’Rourke explained: “It’ll be a struggle for Celtic to meet his wages unless Manchester United subsidise them – that’s probably the only way a potential deal could happen.",
      "“He is one of those players that Manchester United are openly willing to sell; he’s been allowed to return late for pre-season to try and sort out his future.",
      "“Celtic would be an attractive proposition for someone like Malacia next season – but they’ve got Kieran Tierney back at Celtic Park this year as well.",
      "“You’d imagine Tierney would be a starter when fit for Brendan Rodgers, so I’m not sure Malacia will be too keen on moving to a club where he’s not guaranteed minutes either.”",
      "Man Utd have been dealt a blow in their bid to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer as one Bees sale ‘would almost certainly rule out’ another.",
      "Brentford are lining up Ipswich Town forward Omari Hutchinson as a potential replacement for Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Man Utd are racing Everton to the signing of Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi in a potential £9m deal, according to reports.",
      "Everything has changed for Man Utd over Bryan Mbeumo after Nottingham Forest made an offer for Yoane Wissa about £30m below Brentford’s valuation.",
      "Man Utd will seal a deal to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford as talks continue between the two clubs, according to reports."

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders but their business might be almost done now.",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal – £75m\nReports suggest that the Gunners paid £60m for Martin Zubimendi in the end, and we’re adding a few quid for Kepa from Chelsea, because Arsenal always have to buy somebody from Chelsea. And then a tenner for Christian Norgaard.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Como – £76.7m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "7) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "",
      "6) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting three central midfielders as their ‘next priority’ if and when they finally complete a deal for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils triggered Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves early in the window and have also completed the signing of Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno for £3.3m, but further transfer business has stalled as they focus all of their attention on landing Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "They’ve made two bids for the Cameroon international, the latest of which was rejected by the Bees over two weeks ago as the £62.5m offer fell short of their £65m+ valuation.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano provided an update on the long-drawn-out saga earlier this week.",
      "Romano said: “I can guarantee to you again this week, Man United, fully focused on Bryan Mbeumo deal with Brentford, with conversations still underway, with Man United’s absolute focus being on Mbeumo, with a player still waiting for Manchester United as a top priority.",
      "“So they keep advancing. They keep working on this deal for Mbeumo. There is still an agreement to reach with Brentford, but I’m told that the conversations are ongoing to try to reach this agreement and let the player travel and complete his move. So Man United keep working on Bryan Mbeumo as absolute priority.”",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Man Utd transfer takes ‘fresh twist’ as Mbeumo coach ‘breaks silence’ and ‘Gang of Five’ cast ‘shadow’",
      "Red Devils fans are understandably uneasy over the club’s transfer window impasse and The Independent’s Miguel Delaney has now revealed the club’s “next priority” after Mbeumo, assuming they can find buyers for their wantaway cast of misfits.",
      "“There’s been a lot of noise about Manchester United and strikers but the feeling is that the next priority once Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo is secured – it seems to get “closer” every day – is a central midfielder,” he said.",
      "“There is interest in Sporting’s Martin Hjulmand, Bayern Munich’s Joao Palhinha and Palmeiras’ Richard Rios. As almost goes without saying, they of course need to sell first.",
      "“Bayern may be in the same situation, however, which is what makes the Palhinha interest intriguing. The lamentable injury to Jamal Musiala means they have to go back into the market, and that could create a few openings.”",

      "United have also been linked with a host of new strikers despite Rasmus Hojlund’s desire to stay at Old Trafford this summer, and still have the faintest glimmer of hope of signing Viktor Osimhen from Napoli after Romano revealed Galatasaray have had a €70m bid rejected for the Nigerian.",
      "He tweeted: ‘EXCL: Galatasaray submit new proposal to Napoli for Victor Osimhen after €70m rejected! The Turkish club now offers €75m with €40m immediate payment and €35m in installments, with bank guarantees as key point again. Decision up to Napoli once again.’",
      "The transfer guru did though claim on Thursday that both the fee for Osimhen and the striker’s wage demands make a United move unlikely.",
      "“Many of you are asking me if Manchester United can try to hijack this deal,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“I am not aware of Manchester United entering into this one not just for the 75 million euros but also because of the salary.",
      "“The real point between Premier League clubs last summer and this summer has always been about the salary.",
      "“Osimhen is on 12 million euros net salary at Napoli and imagine Galatasaray are prepared to pay 16 million euros net per season.",
      "“This is completely different compared to the wage structure they have at Manchester United. This is why at the moment Manchester United have not made a move.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has ruled out a move from Man Utd to “hijack” Galatasaray’s deal for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen.",
      "According to reports, one Liverpool transfer is about to be ‘triggered’ as a club have expressed their willingness to activate a £64m release clause.",

      "Very good chance we’re projecting a little bit here, but if there were a theme to this summer’s Premier League transfer business thus far it would be Okay, You’ve Had Your Fun.",
      "Everyone enjoyed themselves, didn’t they, watching unlikely and less familiar teams compete for European spots? And everyone really enjoyed watching Tottenham and Manchester United be astonishing levels of sh*t for astonishing periods of time, right up until Spurs somehow unSpursed themselves at the best/worst possible moment.",
      "But we get the impression now that it’s not just Spurs and United themselves spooked by last season’s ineptitude. Some of the other big clubs might have been hit by the realisation that this could happen to them if the Premier League’s middle-class weren’t brought to heel.",
      "Let’s not pretend that the biggest clubs buying the best players from the other clubs in the league is a brand new phenomenon, but we’re not even at the middle of July yet and the heart has been ripped out of several of the upstarts who made last season so different.",
      "And it’s the big clubs doing that ripping. Four of the traditional Big Six are currently Europe’s four biggest spenders this summer, and all of them have moved to take some of the best players from elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool have Milos Kerkez. Chelsea have Joao Pedro. Tottenham have Mohammed Kudus, even if they have managed to Spurs their pursuit of Morgan Gibbs-White up. Man City have got themselves a Rayat Ait-Nouri.",
      "Arsenal will be very much in the top five once they and Sporting stop their absurd game of chicken and just get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres as we all know they eventually will once everyone can agree a way to proceed that allows everyone to feel like they’ve won. They’ve also got themselves a Christian Norgaard to continue the theme anyway.",
      "Man United sneak into the top 10 as well after signing Wolves lunatic Matheus Cunha, and again the only reason they’re not higher is because Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t yet decided precisely which and how many unimportant disposable meatbags he needs to sack to scrape together enough coppers to get himself a Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Is it too early to officially Fear for Brentford? We really think it might not be. They must have known the day would come that Thomas Frank tried his luck at somewhere bigger and also probably stupider, and he will certainly be doing those things.",
      "One of the most interesting things we thought we might learn next season was just how good Frank is, and that this would involve not just what he did at Spurs but what Brentford did in his absence. How much of Brentford’s success has been down to him personally? How able is he to replicate that in a very, very different environment?",
      "But Brentford appear to be about to take on that challenge in even more extreme circumstances than anyone could have imagined. They approach the dizzying uncertainty of life without their inspirational manager – and several members of his backroom staff – also without Norgaard, who did so much to make them tick, as well as almost certainly Mbeumo and quite possibly Yoane Wissa.",
      "And promoting a manager from within represents an admirable but enormous gamble. The desire for some continuity may be understandable, but when you don’t have continuity of players we do wonder how prudent a move that actually is.",
      "The good news for Brentford is that they are far from alone. Wolves have lost Cunha and Ait-Nouri. Brighton have lost Pedro. Forest are about to lose Anthony Elanga and Gibbs-White. Bournemouth have lost Kerkez and Dean Huijsen – even Real Madrid are helping out their big-club mates – while Palace will surely be stripped of some combination of Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and very likely the Europa League.",
      "West Ham’s situation is slightly different, with the sanctioning of Kudus’ sale even to the worst possible place very likely a pretty smart, hard-headed decision to generate significant funds for their squad rebuild by offloading a player who doesn’t quite fit with the new manager’s plans. But it’s still another chastening reminder of how the land lies.",
      "These clubs have all trod this path before and at least some of them will be absolutely fine and possibly even improve for smartly reinvesting that cash in new, cheaper players who go on to become the next big-money signings for the larger beasts.",
      "Last season’s upsetting of the Premier League applecart came about in large part because the money sloshing around the Premier League is such that even the division’s proletariat now find themselves with spending power to outgun pretty much anyone outside the superclubs anywhere else.",
      "But right now it’s an uncomfortable time for a lot of the Premier League’s middle-class as the old order seeks to re-establish itself at their enormous expense."

      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
