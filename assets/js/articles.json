      "Bruno Fernandes has been urged to quit the Premier League and say yes to a lucrative proposal from Al-Hilal by Ruben Neves, the Manchester United captain's Portugal team-mate.",
      "Fernandes, 30, is currently weighing up a mega-money offer to move to the Saudi Pro League following United's worst-ever Premier League campaign. And after admitting he could leave Old Trafford this summer, the midfield maestro's agent, Miguel Pinho, held 'positive' talks with Al-Hilal's powerbrokers in Riyadh this week.",
      "Losing a player of Fernandes' quality would be a bitter blow for Manchester United and, under usual circumstances, it seems unlikely they would even consider cashing in on him.",
      "But the club's need to rebuild under Ruben Amorim with a limited budget, plus their failure to qualify for the Champions League, means they would find it hard to turn down the 100million that Al-Hilal are said to be willing to offer them for their talisman.",
      "And Neves, the former Wolves star who swapped the Premier League for Saudi Arabia two years ago, says he would recommend the move to any of his Portugal colleagues.",
      "\"I recommend all the players in the national team, of course,\" he told A Bola. \"Fortunately, Portugal has produced a lot of talent and continues to do so. We are a lucky country in that respect.",
      "\"We are also very hard-working. A very small country but one that has produced excellent players. Just yesterday we saw four of our players (Gonçalo Ramos, Joao Neves, Nuno Mendes and Vitinha) lift the Champions League.",
      "\"It is an excellent sign for Portugal. I would like to have any player from the national team in my team.\"",
      "While Saudi interest in Fernandes is nothing new, Al-Hilal want Manchester United's captain to give them a decision over a move in the next week.",
      "Fernandes is under contract at Old Trafford until 2027 and has been - by some distance - the Red Devils' best player during a challenging era. The club finished 15th in the Premier League this season under Amorim, who was unable to improve their form after succeeding Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "Recent reports have indicated that Fernandes is giving 'serious consideration' over a move following comments he made after the Europa League final. He threw his future into doubt after United's loss to Tottenham, saying: \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is.",
      "\"Football sometimes is like this. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.",
      "\"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days. The day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.\"",

Cunha, 26, has officially left Wolves and joined the Red Devils on a five-year contract until June 2030 which includes the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "United announced the forward's arrival on Sunday afternoon, having been spotted staying at The Lowry Hotel in Manchester with his family. Cunha will now link up with his international team-mates in Brazil before returning to England for pre-season training following a brief holiday.",
      "By then, Rashford could've left boyhood club United. The 27-year-old is up for sale after spending the second half of this season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "There's been no indication that Villa will trigger their option to buy Rashford for £40million, the price which United are demanding from other suitors. Barcelona have held talks with his agent and brother, Dwaine Maynard, but the newly-crowned La Liga champions would prefer a loan deal.",
      "It's been reported that regardless of Rashford's future, Cunha will take his No.10 shirt. The United academy product has worn the number since 2018 but according to Ferdinand's information, it now belongs to Cunha after he wore the same number for Wolves and former club Hertha Berlin.",
      "Reacting to Cunha's lucrative arrival, Ferdinand told his TikTok followers: \"One of the few players I mentioned a few weeks ago, if I had a shopping list, he would be on there. He knows the Premier League, so he doesn't need any adaptation time.",
      "\"This is a huge factor. I think if you're going to go and buy players from foreign leagues, players that don't have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk. He has the experience here. We've seen him here. He grew up a Man United fan.",
      "\"I'm hearing he's taking the No 10 shirt, which was Rashford's shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford? I don't know. There are a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well.",
      "\"Seventeen goals, six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team, I think it's impressive. I think the recruitment team for Manchester United would have seen, and the coaches here would have seen, what he did to Man United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Man United like a hot knife through butter.\""

      "Matheus Cunha already boasts a varied football career which spans five countries, with the Brazilian first making his mark in Europe thanks to the ex-agent of his footballing idol Ronaldinho. Coming off the most productive season of his career, he netted 17 goals in 36 appearances for Wolves, scoring 15 of those goals in the Premier League.",
      "His starring role in maintaining the club's top-flight status has sparked intense transfer interest from clubs, with Manchester United leading the race for the Brazil international.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have reportedly made positive contact with Cunha's camp over a summer move and plan to trigger his release clause of £62.5million ($83.7m), according to The Athletic.",
      "A payment plan is the current sticking point between the two clubs, with United proposing to spread the fee over five years but Wolves insisting they want it paid across three instalments within the next two years, reports the Express.",
      "Despite this, a deal is still hoped to be brokered for the 26-year-old, who already has extensive experience having played for five clubs across five countries, including his youth career in Brazil.",
      "Cunha’s path to the top began in 2017 when Eric Lovey spotted him playing for Brazilian side Coritiba’s youth team. Lovey, a former FIFA representative, was instrumental in the early career of Brazilian legend Ronaldinho serving as his confidante and agent and quickly became aware of Cunha’s potential.",
      "Recalling Cunha’s talent to Swiss newspaper Blick in 2018, Lovey revealed how he always had big plans for the youngster. \"As soon as I heard about him I wanted to follow his performances,\" Lovey said.",
      "\"During the Nike Cup in the USA he confirmed all the good things I had heard, especially against the Manchester United youth team. He was able to get the better of English players who were already adult-sized. I wasn't there myself but hearing about how he played reinforced my desire to work with him.\"",
      "Lovey's friendship with FC Sion president Christian Constantin saw him facilitate a move to Switzerland for Cunha who made a significant impact in the one season he spent there before RB Leipzig swooped in for his signature in 2018.",
      "Despite showing promise at Sion, the Brazilian struggled to replicate his performance in the Bundesliga, netting only nine goals over 52 appearances for Leipzig, culminating in a transfer to Hertha BSC eighteen months later.",
      "Hertha journalist Marc Schwitzky suggested a clash of styles between Cunha's \"free spirit\" approach and former Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann's tactical discipline may have hampered his success. \"Probably the move to Leipzig came a little too early for Cunha, who was just 19 years old at the time of the transfer,\" he penned.",
      "\"It is natural that settling into one of the best leagues in the world is difficult, especially for young players. In Cunha's case, however, there was also the fact that he wants to be an absolute free spirit on the field.",
      "\"At that time, his game was even wilder, even more individual. Julian Nagelsmann, then still coach at RB Leipzig, however, relies on a strong collective in which every player subordinates himself to the system and has to follow clear instructions.",
      "\"Cunha's talent flashed again and again at Leipzig, where he also provided great moments, but due to a lack of adaptability or tactical discipline, he was only used irregularly and thus again lacked consistency.\""

Cunha, 26, is seen as the kind of player who can turn a team's fortunes around – a quality Manchester United are in dire need of after a disappointing Premier League campaign and their loss in the Europa League final.",
      "It appears the Wolves star is set to be Ruben Amorim's inaugural acquisition this summer, barring any unforeseen hitches. Negotiations are currently ongoing between United and the Midlands club regarding the payment structure for his £62.5million buyout clause.",
      "His time at Bundesliga outfit Hertha Berlin, which he joined in January 2020, saw him rise to cult status among fans. He was also credited with playing a pivotal role in saving the club from relegation, according to Hertha writer Marc Schwitzky.",
      "“Cunha played his way into the hearts of the Berliners,” Schwitzky told The Athletic in January 2023. “He came in January 2020 when the team was completely down and was possibly the main factor in them not being relegated.",
      "“Normally, it is a problem when a team has no offensive flow, but for Cunha, exactly this freedom was perfect, he blossomed completely.",
      "“Many games of the second half of 2020-21 became a Cunha show. Again and again he led the way with spectacular scenes, he didn’t seem to care about all the pressure of relegation, he was just happy to be able to play so much.",
      "“He also started the 2021-22 season fantastically, in the first 10 games he was directly involved in nine goals. But then he fell into a dip in form that he couldn’t get out of.”",
      "Cunha's temporary loss of form led to tensions with Hertha's then-coach Bruno Labaddia, who questioned his tactical discipline – with discipline in all its forms being a recurring theme in Cunha's eventful career.",
      "Despite his obvious talent, Cunha's temperament has been a cause for concern. While netting 17 goals and providing six assists for Wolves across all competitions this season, he also faced behaviour issues.",

      "Bruno Fernandes once quit his former club Udinese because they were underperforming - a move that mirrors his current situation at Manchester United. The Portuguese international has reportedly become a top target for Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Despite being under contract until the summer of 2027, Fernandes’ agent recently met with Al-Hilal officials at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh, where there were positive talks between the two parties stretching late into the night.",
      "The Saudi club are understood to have made the United captain a lucrative offer. Yet, they reportedly informed him that it is a one-time opportunity as they look to sign him within the next fortnight so he is eligible to play at the Club World Cup.",
      "Reports also state the 30-year-old is seriously considering leaving Old Trafford in a staggering £100million transfer after a dismal season under head coach Ruben Amorim, where United endured their worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "While it is still not clear whether Fernandes will part ways this summer, he once left Serie A side Udinese for similar reasons. The playmaker moved to Italy aged 17 and spent five years in Italy, initially at Novara before a move to Udinese in 2013.",
      "But after an impressive first season with the side, his manager Francesco Guidolin decided to step back from coaching, which played a key role in Fernandes leaving for Sampdoria in 2016. In a stark parallel to his time at United, Fernandes recalled that Udinese team having quality players but not being able to produce what was expected of them.",
      "He said in an interview with Cronache di Spogliatoio via Get Italian Football News: “The three years I spent at Udinese were not easy in terms of the team because we didn’t have great campaigns, except for the first one where we had a great squad. We had a strong team, but we weren’t able to achieve what was expected of us.",
      "“Then in the second and third year they decided to change manager after so long with Guidolin, and it didn’t go very well. Guidolin had managed to get the most of my abilities, and made me understand that I had to train more, but he had faith in me.”",
      "Fernandes, who joined United in January 2020 from Sporting CP, made the emotional admission years later that his time in Italy left him wanting to quit football altogether. It was there, whilst playing for Udinese, that he got extremely homesick and lonely, which forced him to reconsider his career path.",
      "Discussing his time in Serie A, he told the Players' Tribune: \"I was all on my own at 17 in a new country. I didn’t speak the language, and I didn’t know anyone, and let me tell you, it was hard. It was unbelievably hard and lonely. There were times when I wanted to quit, absolutely.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed it was his father who instilled a mentality in him to constantly strive for improvement, and admitted he would not have \"survived\" playing in Italy were it not for that attitude.",
      "After a season at Sampdoria, Fernandes returned to his homeland for Sporting, where he thrived before United came calling. He has comfortably been the Red Devils’ best performer since then, winning their Player of the Season award four times, including this campaign.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs are understood to be relaxed about his current situation, wanting to keep their talisman while still being prepared to entertain bids for any player. The club's failure to secure Champions League football by losing the Europa League final has only heightened their need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while still complying with Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules.",

      "With the Premier League season now over, clubs have already begun plotting their moves for the summer transfer window. While there are always many different plots unfolding at the same time, few will have as much focus as the situation around Marcus Rashford.",
      "The 27-year-old spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa after being banished to the Manchester United wilderness by Ruben Amorim. Overall, the United academy graduate made a good impression at Villa Park, contributing four goals and six assists across all competitions, which earned him a recall to the England squad.",
      "The forward's next chapter is currently unknown, but with Amorim showing no signs that he has changed his stance, it is expected the Old Trafford exit door will be propped open for Rashford.",
      "In 17 appearances in all competitions, of which 10 were as a starter, Rashford contributed four goals and six assists. He made a variety of vital contributions, including his brace of assists in Villa's 2-1 victory over Chelsea as well as his impressive display against Paris Saint-Germain, when the Midlanders were so close to overturning a 3-1 aggregate deficit in the Champions League quarter-final.",
      "Under Emery, Rashford looked sharp, hungry, focussed and clinical. Villa fell just short of Champions League qualification, but Emery loves the Europa League and would want a squad that is good enough to battle in Europe and domestically.",
      "However, Villa already have the sixth-highest wage bill in the Premier League and may not be able to accommodate the £325,000-per-week Rashford is believed to be earning at United. From a football perspective, it looks to be a solid fit, but with a £40million buy option on top of a huge salary, the financial implications could be too steep for Villa.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur's dreadful Premier League campaign was overwritten by their Europa League triumph over United, which saw them qualify for the Champions League. The north Londoners' 17th-place Premier League finish was humiliating, but it's easy to forget the terrifying amount of injuries Spurs had to contend with.",
      "As well as losing key players like James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke to injury, captain and talisman Son Heung-min also endured a tough campaign, as his tally of seven goals in 30 Premier League appearances was his lowest since his debut campaign in the 2015/16 season, when he only contributed four goals in 28 appearances. With the South Korean losing his edge in front of goal this season, another forward with pace, directness and a clinical edge may be on Ange Postecoglou's radar.",
      "Rashford could be the perfect fit for the Tottenham boss, especially with his vast Champions League experience. If Tottenham are able to negotiate a good transfer fee with United, who will surely need to sell some players after missing out on the prize money for qualifying for the Champions League, Rashford may be ideal for Spurs.",
      "Along with Liverpool forward Luis Diaz, Rashford was recently name-checked by Barcelona manager Hansi Flick as a player they admire. The German said: \"I don't want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.”",
      "It's been widely reported that Rashford has ambitions of one day playing at the Nou Camp, but Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo recently claimed that the forward's representatives told Barcelona officials he would be willing to lower his wages, to try and earn a move to the La Liga giants.",
      "Barcelona have established themselves as European heavyweights once more, winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League semi-finals. However, with Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal leading the frontline, while Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres provide cover, Rashford may have to work hard to force his way into Flick's plans.",
      "If Barcelona make a serious proposal, it's likely Rashford would jump at the opportunity, but he would need to work harder and play better than he has ever before to dislodge the current stars in Catalunya.",
      "Scott McTominay took the bold decision to leave United and pursue pastures new at Napoli, and he was rewarded with a Serie A title and even a reception with the Pope.",
      "The Scot was a bit-part player at Old Trafford before Antonio Conte's side signed him for around £25.7m. Under the guidance of the ex-Chelsea manager, McTominay became an unstoppable goalscoring midfielder, contributing 12 goals and six assists in 34 appearances.",
      "How Rashford would relish the Conte treatment, which has also had a positive effect on another ex-United striker in Romelu Lukaku, who scored 14 goals and contributed 10 assists. Conte has demanded new signings, and with Napoli also being linked with Alejandro Garnacho in the past, it's possible Conte may prefer Rashford's experience and cutting edge.",
      "However, the biggest uncertainty is Conte's future, as Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis appeared to suggest the Italian could be leaving. He told Napoli fans at their open-top bus celebration: \"I wish Conte continuing success in his professional life. Thank you, Antonio.\"",
      "Rashford has also seen the likes of Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Ruben Loftus-Cheek move to AC Milan and enjoy their football. A space could soon open up at the Rossoneri, as left-winger Rafael Leao currently has an uncertain future at the San Siro.",
      "Milan endured a difficult campaign this year, registering a disappointing eighth-place finish. New energy and a new attitude may be required to jumpstart the European giants, who won Serie A in 2022 and Rashford could be the one to provide that spark.",
      "Their lack of European football next season, though, may mean a move doesn't materialise, given the necessary funds involved.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Alejandro Garnacho looks destined for the Manchester United exit door after Ruben Amorim gave him his marching orders. It's set to be a sad end to what was hoped to be a hugely promising career at Old Trafford.",
      "The Argentine winger, 20, was tipped to follow in Cristiano Ronaldo's footsteps after breaking into the first team under Erik ten Hag. But he's fallen massively out of favour with Amorim, who is believed to have taken issue with his comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho described United's season as \"s***\" and bemoaned his benching after playing in every prior round. According to the Daily Mail, Amorim responded by singling him out at an end-of-season meeting last weekend, with the United boss alleged to have said: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "That comment all but confirmed that his Red Devils stay is over. Garnacho is believed to be valued in the region of £60-70million, but there's no shortage of potential suitors lining up to end his United nightmare, with the window now open from June 1 to June 10 due to the Club World Cup.",
      "Having already had a £40m bid rejected in January, the newly-crowned Italian champions are favourites to secure the youngster's signature. He's a natural replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who departed Naples for PSG in the winter window.",
      "There's therefore no doubt that he could be a regular starter for Antonio Conte. And that's worked wonders for his former team-mate Scott McTominay, who's established himself as a club legend after just one season thanks to his goalscoring heroics.",
      "The i report that Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna is set to meet with United officials to re-open talks for Garnacho. Whether they can meet in the middle of their valuations remains to be seen.",
      "A club that may be more likely to stump up the desired cash is Chelsea. There are no signs that Todd Boehly's wallet won't be flying open this summer like it has done for the last three years.",
      "The Blues might well need to add an extra incentive to persuade INEOS to strengthen a Premier League rival – but there's always a price. As usual, Enzo Maresca doesn't necessarily need yet another attacking option in his ranks.",
      "The future of Jadon Sancho remains up in the air, though. And with Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto being more natural fits on the right wing, there could be room for Garnacho in the XI.",
      "A return to the club where he spent five years of his youth career looks like another potential next move for Garnacho. He left to pursue his \"dream\" in 2020.",
      "A lot has changed since then and Atletico boss Diego Simeone is believed to be a big fan of their former academy prospect. He does, however, appear a less natural fit in Simeone's favoured 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Both Alexander Sorloth and Julian Alvarez enjoyed stunning seasons up top, scoring 20 and 17 league goals respectively. So Garnacho would likely have to drop a touch deeper and put in the legwork that Amorim has often accused him of lacking.",
      "He could enjoy more attacking freedom at the San Siro. Both Inter and AC have been linked with a swoop, but an exit for Rafael Leao could put the latter in the driving seat.",
      "Leao has been linked with a whole host of clubs, including United. There could be a swap deal to be made if Garnacho fancies it.",
      "Milan have been named in reports in Italy as one of the early movers to enter negotiations, alongside Napoli. But their lack of European football next season puts them on the back foot.",
      "The appointment of Ten Hag at the BayArena has naturally sparked suggestions of a reunion for Garnacho in Germany. Leverkusen certainly won't be short of funds this summer.",
      "Liverpool activating Jeremie Frimpong's £29.5m release clause, as well as reportedly closing in on a £100m-plus deal for Florian Wirtz, leaves Ten Hag with a tidy war chest to attack the window with.",
      "Garnacho's profile lends itself to success in Germany, and he was productive under the Dutchman for United. But it's perhaps a riskier move with the club in a transitional period following Xabi Alonso's exit.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "However, they did end the trip on a high note with a 3-1 win over Hong Kong thanks to a brace from Chido Obi and a goal from Ayden Heaven. United have now returned to Manchester and the majority are set to jet off on holiday before beginning their preparations for pre-season.",

      "It remains to be seen whether Garnacho will still be a United player next season, having publicly expressed his frustration at being dropped to the bench for the Europa League final. \"Obviously it's hard for everyone,\" he said after the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham.",
      "\"Our season was s***. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round.",

      "Garnacho was left out of the squad for United's final Premier League game against Aston Villa and Amorim is said to have informed the winger he can leave this summer, with reports claiming he told him: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "When asked about Garnacho's future, Amorim said: \"He is a Manchester United player that is not in the squad today, but he continues to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"I will speak with my players but the focus is the last game. I don't know what is going to happen but we have a plan. We were prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without.",

      "Ruben Amorim's bid to make Manchester United play his way is facing an added complication because the club’s academy teams continue to use a tactical blueprint that doesn’t fit his philosophy.",
      "Amorim accepts that United are unable to spend their way back to the top after missing out on a £100million Champions League jackpot with defeat in the Europa League Final. And the Reds’ boss is ready to keep up the Old Trafford tradition of bringing through youngsters from United’s hugely-productive youth set-up during his rebuild after implementing a similar plan at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "But United’s academy teams are grounded to play a 4-3-3 system that Amorim has no faith in. And he feels the task of bedding young players into his senior squad is even tougher because of how they have spent their formative years.",
      "Old Trafford academy chiefs insist they continue to produce footballers with a skill-set to adapt to any tactical request - and Amorim has given first-team debuts this season to youngsters Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson. He also included the likes of Dan Armer, Jaydan Kamason, Godwill Kukonki, Tyler Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Shea Lacey, Jack Moorhouse and Jim Thwaites in United’s squad for a post-season tour of the Far East.",
      "But there is a disconnect between the way United’s age-group teams play and how Amorim sets up his senior side.",
      "The Reds’ boss remains wedded to a formation that employs a three-man defence and demands that wing-backs provide attacking width. It was a philosophy that worked for him when he was building a reputation as one of Europe’s best coaches at Braga and Sporting.",
      "And he refused steadfastly to adapt his beliefs despite inheriting a United squad that struggled badly to meet their manager’s demands from the moment he took charge in November.",
      "A source said: “Amorim made it clear when he spoke to United about becoming the coach that he needed the freedom to play the way he did in Portugal. Sporting, like United, have a reputation for developing their own talent and their academy also traditionally used 4-3-3.",
      "“But when Amorim became the coach there was also a shift towards 3-4-3 and 3-4-2-1 at youth level to mirror the first team.",
      "“If you look at how Sporting played in the UEFA Youth League this season, you will see that they played with all three formations.”",
      "Some of the problems Amorim inherited at Old Trafford mirror issues he dealt with ruthlessly when he became Sporting coach with 11 games of the 2019-20 season remaining. He immediately ditched the 4-2-3-1 formation employed by managerial predecessor Silas.",
      "Fans’ favourites like Marcos Acuna and Islam Slimani were sold after failing to buckle down to the new boss’ requirements in the same way that Amorim wants to move on Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "A new data-driven approach to recruitment saw players like Pedro Concalves, Pedro Porro, Joao Mario, Nuno Santos, Zouhair Feddal and Bruno Tabata arrive that summer to help implement his tactical requirements.",
      "And the emergence of Matheus Nunes, Eduardo Quaresma, Nuno Mendes, Joelson Fernandes and Tiago Tomas from the youth system helped Sporting become Portuguese champions for the first time in 19 years with just one defeat all season.",
      "Sporting lifted the Portuguese title again under Amorim last year - and have retained the trophy this season despite successor Joao Pereira lasting eight games and current coach Rui Borges opting to use 4-4-2. When Amorim left the club to move to Manchester, his team were averaging 65 percent possession during domestic games.",
      "The United boss spoke often during his tough introduction to life in Manchester about being given the backing of United's owners.",
      "The source added: “Of course Amorim would like money to use in the transfer market.",
      "“But he also needs to be given the freedom to impose the methods he believes in on the club.”",

      "The 26-year-old has been identified as a specialist No.10 to bolster United’s attacking options behind the striker.",
      "United refused to break the £60million barrier for any of their five summer signings last year, but they will stagger the £62.5m payment for Cunha in instalments.",
      "Amorim billed Cunha as \"real quality\" on the eve of the 1-0 defeat to Wolves. \"He [Wolves coach Vitor Pereira] is playing a 3-4-3, he's doing quite well! He's changing some players, he has real quality players - Cunha and all these guys, they have real quality.\"",
      "When pressed on Cunha and possible interest from United, Amorim replied: \"I just gave the example because I remembered about Matheus. He's scoring a lot of goals. Just that.\"",
      "Cunha is the first new face through the door at Carrington this summer. United have just endured the worst season in the club's modern history and Amorim will strengthen his squad.",
      "United were hopeful of signing Liam Delap from Ipswich Town, but the 22-year-old has decided to sign for Chelsea, who are set to trigger his £30m relegation clause at Portman Road.",
      "Other striker targets will be considered and Amorim is expected to sign a new right wing-back."

      "Matheus Cunha is the first signing of the summer window for Manchester United.",
      "Cunha, 26, will officially seal his £62.5million move to Old Trafford when he returns from international duty with Brazil, as his visa and registration need to be formally completed.",
      "The Brazilian has signed a five-year contract, with the option of another year, and he arrives in Manchester with previous experience of playing in Ruben Amorim's formation.",
      "Cunha can play down the middle and on the left, so how would United look with him deployed?",
      "We've listed three ways United could use Cunha next season below...",
      "Cunha is expected to play predominantly in the left No.10 role in Amorim's system. He is right-footed and will be able to cut inside, although he also has the ability to beat an opponent.",
      "United are planning to sign a new striker this summer and supporters will be hoping to see Cunha develop a strong relationship with that new arrival after dismal campaigns for Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Cunha scored 17 goals in all competitions in a struggling Wolves side this season. He is capable of finding the back of the net and will be a huge threat when he plays in the left No.10 role.",
      "Cunha can play down the middle as a traditional striker, or he can play as a false nine, which would be different options for Amorim if he wants to tinker with the position of his new signing.",
      "How effective Cunha would be centrally in a red shirt remains to be seen, but he has played in that role for Wolves during his time at Molineux and understands the intricacies of the position.",
      "It would also open the door for another player to start in the left No.10 position.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can find a new club this summer, which rules him out, but Amorim has liked to play Mason Mount in that role and perhaps he would start there.",
      "Al-Hilal are currently in discussions with Bruno Fernandes' agent over a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "It's been claimed the decision could be confirmed next week. Fernandes is a guaranteed starter and he's practically always available, so matchdays would be very different if he departed.",
      "It would be a huge blow to lose Fernandes and Cunha would have to step up to help fill the void. Fernandes has been a consistent source of goals since he signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2020, and Cunha will be a great signing if he can have half the impact of the Portugal international.",
      "United would have to sign a new midfielder to replace Fernandes and Cunha would miss out on playing with him."

      "The 26-year-old scored 17 goals for Wolves in the 2024/25 season and that was enough to convince United to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Ruben Amorim made Cunha his number one attacking midfield target and he will slot into his strongest United starting XI in one of the two attacking midfield roles in his 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "After a season where United finishing 15th in the Premier League has left them facing up to the sobering reality of no European football next season, everyone around the club needed a lift and something to believe in as Amorim prepares for his first summer in charge at United.",
      "Cunha's arrival will certainly do that but United simply have to ensure this is the first of a number of quality signings this summer and not where their transfer window peaks.",
      "Nobody of sane mind is suggesting United can compete for the Premier League title next season but bridging the gap between themselves and reigning champions Liverpool has to be the long term aim.",
      "No United fan needs reminding that Liverpool finished on double the amount of points United earned this season, with 42 points separating the two sides.",
      "Arne Slot's side have also moved quickly in the transfer market and announced the arrival of Bayer Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong in a £29.5million deal to plug the gap left by Trent Alexander-Arnold joining Real Madrid.",
      "Liverpool have also submitted a £109million bid for Bayer Leverkusen playmaker Florian Wirtz in a bid to beat off Bayern Munich for his signature.",
      "They have also opened talks over the signing of Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez, with the Cherries valuing the Hungarian international at around £45million.",
      "If Liverpool secure all three signings that would represent a £183.5million improvement on a squad that just won the Premier League by 10 points.",
      "As we previously said, challenging for the Premier League title shouldn't be on United's agenda next season. But competing for the European places should be and the urgency with which the champions are moving in the transfer market should serve as a warning for their Premier League rivals.",
      "United need at least a new midfielder, a new forward, a new goalkeeper and potentially another attacking midfielder should one, or both, of Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes leave the club this summer.",
      "While Cunha is an excellent signing, his arrival at Old Trafford has to be the first of many."

      "Reports in Italy have claimed Manchester United's director of negotiations recently travelled to Italy to meet with Napoli about Victor Osimhen, who is available for transfer this summer.",
      "The Italian press says Matt Hargreaves met with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and discussed a potential swap deal involving Osimhen and Rasmus Hojlund during the exchange.",
      "Take it with a pinch of salt, but a swap deal to sign Osimhen would make sense, especially now Liam Delap has chosen to sign for Chelsea. United wanted to sign Delap from Ipswich Town, although it was inevitable that failing to qualify for European football next season would influence his thinking.",
      "Many will argue Delap shouldn't have been the preferred striker target in the first place because United need a proven goalscorer, and Delap has just one season in the Premier League.",
      "Osimhen does not have experience in England, but his scoring record has been impressive throughout his career and he is the closest thing to a guarantee of goals in the transfer market.",
      "The Nigerian scored 76 goals in 133 games for Napoli and played a key role in their 2022/23 Serie A title triumph with 26 goals. Although his form dropped off as Napoli finished 10th and had three different managers, he regained momentum during his time on loan in Turkey this term.",
      "Osimhen was sent on loan to Galatasaray because Chelsea were in talks to sign him last August, only to fail to agree personal terms and the move dramatically fell through at the 11th hour.",
      "The transfer window slammed shut and Osimhen was left stranded at Napoli, yet he needed a move away because Antonio Conte had decided he was not in his plans in Naples.",
      "Napoli failed to offload Osimhen permanently last summer, but history won't repeat itself. Osimhen will be sold and a swap deal might tick a lot of boxes for all the parties involved.",
      "Hojlund was signed from Atalanta and would return to a league he already knows. Napoli would receive a transfer fee along with Hojlund. In return, United would finally add a proven striker to their squad.",
      "It would be an ideal outcome, although it's probably wishful thinking and United might not be happy to stump up a fee, and include Hojlund in a deal, to bring Osimhen to Manchester.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea. Around £30m and Hojlund would reportedly be entertained for a sensational swap deal.",
      "There is also the issue of Osimhen's wage demands. They are rarely a problem in football, but the striker's demands were too much for Chelsea last summer and could be a stumbling block again.",
      "Osimhen is said to be demanding huge wages and Ineos have lowered the wage bill since gaining control of football operations, so he would have to compromise to sign for United.",
      "Ruben Amorim needs a striker who can consistently find the back of the net and players like Osimhen are not easily attainable very often, which means United must do everything they can to sign him.",
      "All options should be on the table, including creative transfers like potential swap deals."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Sunday, June 1.",
      "The summer transfer window is officially open - at least for now. It will temporarily close on June 10 ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, before reopening on June 16.",
      "United are aiming to complete their transfer business early, having already reached an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim's side continue to be linked with additional attacking options to strengthen their current squad.",
      "Their hunt for a new striker has taken a setback with Liam Delap set to join Chelsea for £30million. The likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli's Victor Osimhen are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples attempting to negotiate a deal. Osimhen is expected to push for a swift resolution, especially after his high-profile move collapsed on deadline day last summer.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked with United, largely due to his strong relationship with manager Rúben Amorim. However, the Reds appear to face stiff competition, with a growing queue of suitors that now reportedly includes Liverpool.",
      "However, further signings beyond a striker are unlikely to be pursued until funds are generated through player sales. Unfortunately, that could see Bruno Fernandes depart the club, amid continued links to a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves has been earmarked as a potential replacement for the Portuguese captain.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United transfer blog this evening.",
      "That is all for today but make sure you come back tomorrow for more United news, views and updates.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho can put an end to his United exile with the first part of the summer transfer window opening.",
      "Moves can now be made from June 1 to June 10 as a result of the Club World Cup before the market is underway for good on June 16. One of United's first pieces of business is expected to be offloading Garnacho after Amorim told him he's free to find a new club.",
      "The 20-year-old, once seen as a potential successor to Cristiano Ronaldo, fell further out of favour after labelling United's season \"s***\" and calling out his lack of playing time following the Europa League final loss to Tottenham. With an estimated value between £60-£70million, several clubs are interested in rescuing him from his Old Trafford woes.",
      "Here at MEN Sport, we've taken a look at the possible clubs Garnacho could join.",
      "Some may wonder why Cunha is choosing to join United due to their current predicament.",
      "It is believed that his heart was set on United because he loves the Reds.",
      "If Fernandes is allowed to leave Old Trafford this summer, it could be a defining moment in the Reds' history.",
      "On the one hand, they could reinvest those funds into a couple of key players who could change their fortunes around.",
      "Alternatively, nobody fills that void and United slip deeper into the abyss.",
      "Either way, it is a huge gamble...",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs understands that Al Hilal are growing increasingly confident that they will be able to sign Fernandes.",
      "It is believed the United captain is currently deliberating with hsi family ahead of a possible move.",
      "The Saudi club want an answer by Friday. While there has been no official bid to the club yet, there is a growing confidence that United will accept their offer if Fernandes asks to leave.",
      "Another player who has been consistently linked to United is Viktor Gyokeres and he has discovered another club will not be looking to sign him this summer.",
      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco confirmed, as per A Bola:",
      "Gyokeres is a great striker who did excellent things at Sporting but we’re currently not looking for that position. We have [Robert] Lewandowski at number nine.",
      "Some good news for United if they are trying to sign Osimhen in the summer transfer window as a replacement for their Delap interest.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport understand that Juventus are no longer in the race to sign the Napoli forward.",
      "He is believed to be unattainable and the suggestion is that Rasmus Hojlund could be on their radar instead.",
      "United will most likely need to turn their attention to an out and out centre-forward next.",

      "Real Madrid have been named first for a fourth successive edition with a value of $6.75bn (£5bn), while fellow Spanish powerhouse Barcelona sit third in the financial standings at $5.65 bn (£4.1bn).",
      "Read more here.",
      "Matheus Cunha is now officially a Manchester United player!",
      "While there is absolutely no denying his ability, attitude concerns and disciplinary issues have been raised and that could be a potential problem for Ruben Amorim.",
      "With that said, you can now have your say on whether or not the £62.5million signing is a good one...",
      "Barcelona could turn their attention away from Marcus Rashford with a number of alternatives identified.",
      "Spanish outlet El Nacional have claimed that club president Joan Laporta would prefer to sign AC Milan star Rafael Leao over both Rashford and Liverpool's Luis Diaz.",
      "With Raphinha and Lamine Yamal at the club, whoever comes in may be forced to play a reduced role but Rashford's dream still appears to be Barcelona.",
      "As the Premier League season has now concluded, clubs are already strategising for the summer transfer window.",
      "Among the many unfolding narratives, the situation surrounding Rashford is drawing significant attention. The 27-year-old spent the latter half of the season on loan at Aston Villa after being sidelined at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The United academy product made a positive impact at Villa Park, netting four goals and providing six assists across all competitions, earning him a recall to the England squad.",
      "According to The Sun, non-international players are expected to return to Carrington earlier than usual, with some possibly resuming training before the end of June.",
      "Rúben Amorim is reportedly demanding exceptionally high fitness standards and is prepared to drop any player who falls short. It's claimed he has even asked players about their holiday plans, determined to leave no stone unturned in his efforts to spark a turnaround.",
      "The report also states that Amorim wants United to start the season strongly, with Manchester City and Chelsea potentially facing disrupted starts due to their involvement in the Club World Cup.",
      "A club source is quoted as saying: \"Amorim needs a good pre-season. He's not shied away from the pressure he's under. He would have always preferred to have arrived at United ahead of a new season rather than in the middle of it. He has to get this right. He's told the players there are no more excuses. His job is on the line — and so too is theirs. The club can't accept any more failures.\"",
      "The family of Bruno Fernandes still need to be convinced of a move to Al Hilal from Manchester United, according to journalist Ben Jacobs.",
      "The United captain has a £100million offer on the table from the Saudi Pro League club and MEN Sport have already reported he is heavily considering the move.",
      "However, the latest updates suggest he could stay with Al Hilal also growing frustrated by a final decision not yet coming, given their eagerness to have more players available for the Club World Cup, and Fernandes' demands.",

      "With that said, he has uploaded a new Instagram post which shows what player United would be getting.",
      "A post shared by Victor Osimhen ( MFR ) (@victorosimhen9)",
      "Man United are close to securing the £62.5million signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have activated his £62.5million release clause and his 17 goals and six assists for Wolves this season make him an exciting addition to the club's attacking options.",
      "But with Cunha's arrival pretty much signed, sealed and delivered, the question now is what United's next transfer this summer will look like.",
      "More here.",
      "In 2017, the then-Coritiba youth talent Cunha was discovered by Eric Lovey, who was serving as a representative of the FIFA Secretary General.",
      "\"As soon as I heard about him I wanted to follow his performances,\" Lovey told Swiss newspaper Blick in 2018. During the Nike Cup in the USA he confirmed all the good things I had heard, especially against the Man United youth team.",
      "\"He was able to get the better of English players who were already adult-sized. I wasn’t there myself but hearing about how he played reinforced my desire to work with him.\"",
      "The Brazilian made a strong impression in Switzerland during just one season before RB Leipzig came calling in 2018.",
      "After being told he can leave Man United, Garnacho made his feelings clear during the club's post-season tour of Asia.",
      "Unlike last summer, Garnacho looks set to leave Old Trafford with the growing need to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Garnacho was left out of the Manchester derby in December due to concerns over his attitude.",
      "In February, he walked straight down the tunnel after being substituted in the first half against Ipswich Town. That incident was followed by his public criticism of Ruben Amorim’s team selection and his description of the campaign as a 's**t' season after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "Man United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "Cunha was spotted outside The Lowry Hotel on Sunday morning, checking out with his family.",
      "Sources suggested Cunha was due to dine at The Ivy on Saturday night, but only the players' representatives and United's director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, were spotted. The Brazilian headed to catch his flight to South America for international duty after leaving The Lowry Hotel.",
      "The 26-year-old has been identified as a specialist No.10 to bolster United’s attacking options behind the striker.",
      "Read more here.",
      "David Beckham believes Man United's players are not representing the club well away from the pitch.",
      "Aljenandro Garnacho and Amad were both pictured flipping their middle finger in contrasting circumstances on the tour, and Beckham has suggested the players behaved poorly.",
      "\"It’s tough times. I don’t like seeing some of things that are going on at the club,” Beckham told CBS Sports. \"On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not ok in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United.",
      "\"You have to represent the badge. That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner. We were a part of a team that was so well-mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "\"Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans. We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.\"",
      "The future of Marcus Rashford remains uncertain, but United are reportedly unwilling to let him leave on loan amid interest from Barcelona.",
      "Spanish publication Sport has claimed that Barca are not willing to meet United's £40million asking price and would instead be interested in a loan deal. United are said to be \"refusing to negotiate anything other than a permanent transfer.\"",
      "If nothing changes by the final stages of the summer transfer window - after all other options have been explored - the report suggests that United would likely agree to a loan deal at that point.",
      "It's also been reported that Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, held talks with Deco at a hotel in Barcelona.",
      "When quizzed on Rashford and Luis Diaz, Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick said last week: \"Both fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.\"",

      "The Bundesliga club reportedly wants an initial fee of £75million for the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals last season. Meanwhile, journalist Christian Falk told Caught Offside: \"Man Utd have secret weapon in bid to steal Sesko from Arsenal.",
      "\"There are already talks with Arsenal. From the Premier League, beside Arsenal also Manchester United are particularly interested. [United's director of recruiment] Christopher Vivell was there to watch Sesko at the game in Wolfsburg in mid-April. He once helped discover him and brought the footballer to Salzburg as a 16-year-old in 2019.\"",
      "He previously held roles at Chelsea and RB Leipzig, but it was during his time at RB Salzburg in 2019 that he first signed Sesko, bringing the striker in from Domzale.",
      "FC Barcelona have already started working towards signing new players for next season, but Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres isn't one of them amid links to United.",
      "That's according to Barcelona sporting director, Deco, who chatted about the Catalan giants in an interview with Spanish outlet Sport. Speculation over Gyokeres' future continues to grow, as the Swede has yet to announce his next move or whether he'll simply stay at Sporting.",
      "With his family, national team coach, Sporting CP manager, and teammates all being asked about his future, it was no different for Deco. However, the ex-Portugal regular was quick to shut down any possibility of Barcelona signing Gyokeres.",
      "\"He is a great striker who did excellent things at Sporting but, right now, we are not looking in that position,\" Deco told Sport. \"We have [Robert] Lewandowski at No.9.\"",

      "As is routine when new signings are confirmed, United posted content to their social media account. Being a Sunday out of the normal season, supporters will have to wait to hear from their new signing but the club did release a graphic on Instagram confirming his arrival which he replied to with the love heart and fire emojis.",
      "Among those to express their support for the signing were Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, Amad, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes who all liked the post. Despite being the captain, Fernandes is the player who is deemed least likely to be at Old Trafford next season, as things stand.",
      "MEN Sport understands the midfielder is 'seriously considering' a move to Al Hilal this summer. Fernandes' agent Miguel Pinhos was in Riyadh this week to discuss terms of a deal with the Saudi Pro League club.",
      "Al Hilal, who are set to compete in the Club World Cup this month, are trying to sign Fernandes before the tournament in the United States begins. It has been rumoured that the financial package on offer to the midfielder could be worth as much as £700,000 per week."

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has delivered a classy message to defender Jonny Evans. The 37-year-old called time on his career after two years with United having featured sporadically throughout his final season at Old Trafford.",
      "Evans played his final professional match for United during their win over Hong Kong on Friday, bringing the curtain down on a career that saw him win three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and League Cups as well as a Champions League and Club World Cup winners medal. He also made over a century of international caps for Northern Ireland, amassing 537 outings for both United and Leicester City.",
      "The central defender returned to United in 2023, initially on a short-term deal during their pre-season build-up, on a one-year deal before he signed a fresh extension, which expired this summer.",

      "\"Very fortunate to share some amazing memories with you. An incredible career and I wish you nothing but the best in your retirement (other than when we play golf).\"",
      "Evans got to bid farewell to the club after their final day of the season win over Aston Villa, the players congregated around the centre circle while the defender expressed his gratitude to supporters.",
      "The 37-year-old suffered an injury-disrupted season at United but was said to have played a key role in the dressing room helping the club's younger players.",
      "Speaking prior to the win over Hong Kong in their final post-season friendly, Ruben Amorim said: “It's really nice and the level he has in training, you can see the standards in his prime and you understand why they won so many titles.",
      "“With his age, with a lot of problems physically, when he was fit to train, the level was really high. You can understand he was a very good player.”",
      "With Evans departing, it marks a summer of change for United and Amorim with a massively important summer transfer window for the club. Matheus Cunha was confirmed as the first of the summer for the Portuguese and his third signing since replacing Erik ten Hag.",
      "United triggered the £62.5million release clause in Cunha's contract at the Molineux Stadium, and the forward has signed a five-year contract, with the option of another year."

Doubt about whether or not Fernandes would be at the club next season began immediately after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",

With Napoli wanting a permanent exit, Chelsea, Juventus and Manchester United have all been linked.",

The boardroom remains at loggerheads with the fanbase, the stadium still remains unfit for purpose and the playing squad have just rallied around to accomplish the worst Premier League campaign ever.",

If he just so happened to be in the United States, Amorim could have caught Beckham laying into his squad.",

      "Manchester United brought their post-season tour to an end with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.",
      "After trailing 1-0 at half-time, United flipped the game on its head in the second half via a brace from Chido Obi and a late header from Ayden Heaven.",
      "It marked a victorious conclusion to a 67-game season that everyone associated with United will be keen to forget about as quickly as possible.",
      "With the tour now wrapped up and the season officially done and dusted, full focus switches to the summer transfer window and the start of next season. But following the conclusion of the tour of Asia, which saw United visit Malaysia before travelling to Hong Kong, MEN Sport has picked out four post-tour talking points:",
      "After being informed by Ruben Amorim prior to last Sunday's Premier League finale against Aston Villa at Old Trafford that he will be free to leave the club this summer, the last thing Alejandro Garnacho would have wanted is to travel to Asia on a post-season tour and participate in two meaningless friendlies.",
      "After starting the 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on the bench, Garnacho was named in the starting XI for the win over Hong Kong. Despite earning cheers from supporters every time he touched the ball and attempting to be inventive when he had possession, his mannerisms off the pitch were not of somebody in a good mood.",
      "United staff shadowed him carefully during a signing session in Hong Kong, during which he never broke into a smile. He also ignored requests to speak to journalists in the mixed zone after the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars, walking straight through, donning dark sunglasses as midnight approached.",
      "The biggest positive of the post-season tour by a country mile was Obi claiming his first goals for United's first-team, netting a smart brace in the win in Hong Kong. For his first goal, he swivelled inside the box and fired a clinical left-footed shot into the back of the net.",
      "His second goal was all about his intelligent movement and reading of the game. Recognising Mason Mount, who also impressed in the second half against Hong Kong, was about to float a ball into the box, the young Dane was quick to make a run across his man and glance a header into the bottom corner.",
      "Obi, in that move alone, produced much better movement inside the box than fellow countryman Rasmus Hojlund did at any point across his two starts on tour. Hojlund's box movement is one of his biggest flaws.",
      "Obi, meanwhile, looked razor-sharp against Hong Kong and his two goals, despite not being competitive strikes, will have done him the world of good. With a full pre-season under his belt, he could get a more prominent role in the squad next season.",
      "The main purpose of United's trip to Asia may have been for commercial reasons, with the six-day trip expected to bank them somewhere between £8million and £10m, but that was never going to create headlines. Instead, transfer talk was always going to do fill column inches.",
      "After Amorim, sitting alongside Mount at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, said United \"cannot do much\" in this summer's window, Omar Berrada, the following day, said United will have to be \"prudent\" in their attempts to strengthen the squad ahead of next season.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now,\" Berrada told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve. So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.\"",
      "With that in mind, United are unlikely to be able to attack the transfer window as much as they would have liked. Instead, as a result of missing out on the improved revenue streams that would have come with securing Champions League qualification, they will have to be that little be wiser and shrewder.",
      "One of the biggest positives United have had to shout about this calendar year have been the performances of January recruit Heaven. Despite only making six competitive appearances before the end of the season and two on the tour, the 18-year-old defender has not put a foot wrong since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He has a solid reading of the game, his positional awareness is spot on and his ability on the ball is excellent. As a left-footer, he could find himself ahead of Lisandro Martinez in the race to start on the left of the back-three come the end of next season.",
      "Although Hong Kong did not provide the sternest test United have ever faced, Heaven, following his half-time introduction, was able to progress the ball really well from deep areas and help his teammates get up the pitch. Those ball-playing credentials in a centre-back and becoming more and more important in the modern game, and United appear to have uncovered a gem."

So I think it's good that the season almost ends and hopefully soon I can be back on the pitch and for pre-season back fit.",

      "How is it being offered over here in this environment?",
      "\"Yeah, I mean I wouldn't say it's ideal, obviously, but it's the way it is. It's for the players to accept the things how they are. Also here I can do the job. The facilities are really good. The physios are here with us, so I'm not complaining about that.\"",
      "What will you do when you go home? Do you keep going to Carrington for treatment or will you go back to Holland? How will that work?",
      "\"Yeah, that's still something we have to discuss. Obviously it has been a really long season and the last one-and-a-half month I didn't play, but still I think everybody needs a holiday. But as I said, I think tomorrow, two days from now, we go back to Carrington and then we'll discuss what's the best plan.\"",
      "I was surprised when I put your age in, how young you are. Because I always think how young you were when you captained Ajax to that Champions League semi-final. It's almost kind of, not defining for your career, but it's a big focus point on your career. When we were saying that obviously next season Manchester United are not going to have European football and that will be the first time, I would imagine in your career that you've not experienced that?",
      "\"Well, I experienced it once. It was actually also after a Europa League final against United (in 2017), and the season after we reached the semi-final of the Champions League. So, let's keep that! On a serious note, I've been used to playing in the Champions League for my whole career, more or less. This season was the Europa League, but it was also really, really nice and obviously we reached the final and unfortunately we couldn't win it. Next season will be different with less games. I think more time to prepare for the games, so hopefully we can get the benefits from that.\"",
      "How much does that extra time help? Because Ruben's talked about it quite a lot. He came in November when the schedule was really packed. But looking forward to next year, three midweeks, that's more time out on the grass, isn't it?",
      "\"Yeah, I think obviously every player wants to play as many games as possible. So, it will be different. But I think for the manager, as you said, there's more time to train, more time also to have an intensive tactical session, because obviously you can still train tactical if you play a lot of games but you cannot put the intensity in because you're playing every two days a game. So, I think in that way, as the manager said, it could be an advantage and hopefully we can exploit that.\"",
      "Will you be watching the Champions League? Do you watch a lot of football or will it just be kind of you switch off from it?",
      "\"Well, I watched a lot of football when I was younger. The last years I lived it less because I have been busy and the football is changing a bit. But the big games I still watch, I still like, I still watch.\"",
      "Do you think football is becoming less exciting? There was a quote from Bielsa that it's becoming more of a business than a sport...",
      "\"Yeah, just speaking from my point of view, obviously I'm now 25. So, obviously everything that is from the past, I make it nicer than it was. But for me, football before was more interesting to watch. I think now it's what you said, it's a little bit more business, it's a little bit more about results and maybe the flair or the crazy actions where people are going for the statement becomes less and less. So I think that's the development now of football and let's see how it goes, if it stays or if it's changing. I don't know.\"",
      "When you signed for United, it felt like it was a long time coming because I'm sure you remember playing in Edwin van der Sar's testimonial against Manchester United's junior side and Jose Mourinho seemed to be really interested in you as well. One of the heads of the academy a few years ago also said that he really wanted to bring you to United. Do you remember any of those conversations when you were younger at all of United's interest?",
      "\"To be fair, before that summer I never really have spoken to United. I knew that in the summer I went to Juventus (in 2019), that United had a kind of interest, but I think they went for 'H' (Harry Maguire). So for me at that stage, the Premier League was a maybe, I said it also on interview, the Premier League is the biggest league in the world, the quickest league in the world and I felt at that point I was ready, but for my development it could have been better to go to another league a step above, but not the highest. It was never really an option for me, but that summer it was for the first time really an option.\"",
      "Can you tell me, there's been a lot of talk this season because it's not been a great season, about the pressure of playing for Manchester United and the weight of the shirt, which we tend to talk more about England, but it is a kind of factor with United. You've played for some of the biggest clubs, clearly Ajax are enormous in Holland, Bayern in Germany, Juventus in Italy. Is there a difference in pressure or is it just because you haven't won enough matches?",
      "\"I think it's the last [thing] as, what you said, the pressure is all the same. You need to win. I've been at Ajax, my first team, and there were moments where we were not playing good and they were also cynical. They were saying we scored, let's say we were 3-0 behind in the last minute, we scored 3-1, so we're still losing and they said 10, 10, 10, sarcastic. I'm used to that kind of thing.",
      "\"But I think the biggest difference right now is that this season was such below expectations that the pressure feels much more on you, especially because you don't get much joy because you don't win many games. It feels even more and more and more. I think that's what a lot of players are experiencing this season. As you can see, it also can change real quick, like you saw in the Europa League, how the emotions were also with the players and together with the fans. That's something that I think can be really tough, but it can also be amazing. I think hopefully next season we can make it amazing.\"",
      "What do you think has got to change next season specifically, not to be another below-par performance?",
      "\"I think what I'm experiencing now is what I like to see and that is what the manager is doing right now. I'm not speaking into details, but I have a feeling he's really looking at the spots. I'm not speaking about players only, but also about the whole culture and the way we are working at the club. I think he's really into details. Before signing new players, before signing new things, he's first looking at what is the culture, what needs to change, what can improve to become a better football club. I think from next season we will see more of that.\"",
      "How is he communicating that to you, or is it just something you've noticed yourself?",
      "\"I've got a really good relationship with him, to be fair. He's really open also with me, so it's really nice to speak with him. Obviously, I've experienced many managers. He's one of the managers who is the most easy to talk to as a player. In the same way, you can also see what he's doing, what he wants to do with the team. I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, especially, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have.",
      "\"Maybe like before, you were united with the best players, but you're not a team. I think that's something that's really positive. Hopefully, next season, from the pre-season, we can work really strong on that because we have a lot of time.\"",
      "Do you think that's why he is so harsh with his words sometimes? Last night (Wednesday), the friendly crowd booed at the end. Does that work for you? Could it be too much sometimes?",
      "\"I'm from Holland so I like it! I can understand that for the media, they're in shock because they're like, normally this doesn't happen. But I think you can also, as a media, be really happy that finally someone speaks out and speaks out what he thinks and speaks the truth instead of going around and stuff like that. I really appreciate him in our conversations personally, how we speak. That gives me a feeling that I can trust him and he can trust me.\"",
      "How has it been with the back three/back two switch? I don't know how much you played that in your career previously. You must have done. What's that been like, that sort of progression and how can it be better next season? Because it feels like that's essential to having the formation be an attacking one rather than a back five almost.",
      "\"I think it's a discussion that comes up a lot, obviously. It's always like, oh, three in the back, four in the back. I think if you really analyse our games, it's not that static. It's in a way that we are always defending in a three, always in a four. I think in the build-up, all the European teams, the big European teams play with a three in the back. They switch the midfielder in the back or a full-back who comes back. So it's always in a three.",
      "\"But then maybe the difference is that sometimes, how do you... what kind of players do you put in certain positions? How do you want to play? You can play with five in the back or you can play with three in the back. It's completely different. I think that's something that we will see maybe a little bit more from us next season. Hopefully we can give also the fans a little bit more joy also in the way of playing and also, especially ourselves also, in showing what we can do.\"",
      "For you in particular, having played for Erik at Ajax, was it a drastic difference for you going from playing under him and then changing to Ruben?",
      "\"Well, I've experienced a lot of managers in my career already. So I think I can say that I adapted quite well to the new manager. Obviously for me, the position, it changes but it's not that much. It's more like right centre back with Erik or it's like right centre back in the middle of a three. Obviously it's a difference but it's manageable. So yeah, obviously when you have a new manager, it's always finding out how he works, what he wants and as I said, we have a good relationship. so it was quite easy for me.: So yeah, it was okay. It was nice.\"",
      "So how important, given you lost the final and what happens this season, how important is it to make a good start? Because you talk about pressure, you can really do without that or coming back on you straight away next season?",
      "\"Yeah, but that's for every club. I mean, every club it's important to start well, to start strong. As we said, we have a really long pre-season now to prepare us for the new league. So yeah, that will be really important and obviously, especially after this season, it's also for us, I think an obligation to defend.\"",
      "I saw you singing with gusto the 'Glory Glory Man United' song. But you seem to take that responsibility seriously at that level, having been a captain at such a young age. What do you put into that? What kind of value do you think that gives players that connection with the fans?",
      "\"No, obviously really important. I mean, we know we had a difficult season this season. so from the outside it's really easy to say, oh, what are they doing now? They go on the bus and stuff like that. But you obviously have to deal also with millions of fans in Asia who are probably also for the club really important, for us as players also really important and obviously don't see us as often as the people from Manchester or from England. So that's why these trips are so important for us and for them. It's so valuable because it really gives you a connection for us to see how they view us but also for them to see us close. So I think even if it's after a season like this, it's not the easiest trip but it's so nice for us to show our love also to the fans. So yeah, it's good.",
      "And the next open-top bus parade (after his appearance on one in Kuala Lumpur) will be with a trophy?",
      "\"Yeah, that would be nice!\""

      "Ruben Amorim is keen to bolster his ranks and look to improve following a dreadful campaign. United finished 15th in the Premier League - their lowest finish since 1973/74 when they were relegated to the second tier. They had a chance to all-but save their season and secure Champions League qualification through the Europa League, but the Reds lost in the final against Tottenham.",
      "Matheus Cunha has been identified as a top target for Amorim and United. The 26-year-old is expected to become United's first summer transfer, though the deal has been delayed. It has been reported that the issue holding up Cunha's move relates to attaining a visa.",
      "Despite this, Cunha to United is still expected to go through and he is anticipated to be the first of several players to come through the Old Trafford doors. With this in mind, here is the latest transfer news from United...",
      "According to A Bola in Portugal, Ruben Amorim has Sporting CP attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves in his summer plans, with interest expected to increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "It's reported that United are considering the 26-year-old Sporting star and weighing up the possibility of moving forward with an offer for Amorim's former player.",
      "Sporting, however, insist that they won't consider offers for Goncalves under his £67million release clause and want to keep him at the club beyond this summer.",
      "MEN says: Even if Fernandes is sold, £67m for Goncalves does feel too steep. He has played just 20 matches this season due to injuries, and at 26 years of age, United could get someone better for that price.",
      "Goncalves may be suited to Amorim's system, having played under the United head coach at Sporting, but I think United should target Eberechi Eze instead. The Crystal Palace midfielder is valued at £60m and he could be the perfect No.10 addition for the Reds this summer.",
      "He would strengthen the starting XI and has the potential to take United to the very next level, having performed on a consistent basis in England for years.",
      "Manchester United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "MEN says: Minteh is a top talent and ready-made Premier League performer, but I don't think United should be targeting him this summer. They should be looking at a more natural No.10 to suit Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, rather than an out-and-out winger.",
      "If Amorim played with natural wide players, Minteh is someone United should have on their radar, there is no doubt about it. He is only 20, has impressed in his breakthrough Premier League season and has the ability to become a superstar in the future."

      "“I think he’s the type of player that Ruben Amorim has been crying out for and with neither [Rasmus] Hojlund or [Joshua] Zirkzee at the moment looking like the answer in advanced positions, I think he has a real opportunity to play across one of those three positions quite easily, as a nine, as one of the guys off the sides.”",
      "He added: “The only thing I would say in this window is that £60m in this window, it will remain to be seen what type of work gets done when you’re spending a big chunk like that.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been ‘informed’ of the potential to sign a former Chelsea striker, among a number of other Premier League clubs.",
      "United have not had the best time of it with striker signings in the past couple of years. They signed Rasmus Hojlund for £72million two years ago, and Joshua Zirkzee joined in a £36.5million deal last summer.",
      "Both men played more than 30 Premier League games in the season just gone, but neither passed five goals.",
      "As a result, there’s speculation regarding both being sold, with United to sign a better striker. They have some big names on their radar, but might struggle to convince any great players to join given their lack of any European football next term.",
      "They have been offered a solution, though, as TBRFootball reports United are among the clubs who have been ‘approached’ by the representatives of Tammy Abraham, and ‘informed’ on his willingness to return to the Premier League.",
      "Abraham played 89 times in the English top flight, largely with Chelsea, and scored 26 goals and assisted seven more.",
      "He moved to Roma in 2021, and went on loan to AC Milan this season, racking up 47 goals and 20 assists since heading to Italy.",
      "At Milan this season, Abraham was directly involved in 17 goals, but wants to come back to England, and several Premier League sides are informed on his situation.",
      "TBRFootball’s report states West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have all taken an interest in him, while Aston Villa and Leeds are both keeping tabs on the striker’s situation.",
      "Villa know about Abraham’s qualities, having had him on loan when they were in the Championship in 2018-19. That was their last season in the second tier, with the striker helping them back to the top flight with 25 regular season goals and three assists, as well as a goal in the playoffs, which Villa won.",
      "Though that was now seven seasons ago, it has been suggested a few times in recent seasons that Villa might like to bring Abraham back to the club if possible.",
      "It looks unlikely that Marcus Rashford will be signed permanently, given he and Barcelona want to join forces, so Villa might well be keen on signing a new striker."

      "Manchester United man Alejandro Garnacho has reportedly chosen a Premier League rival as his next club after it was felt he tried to “annoy people so much that there was no option but to sell him.”",
      "Garnacho has caused controversy at a few times of late. On United‘s tour of Southeast Asia, he’s suggested to have pushed past a fan in the street.",
      "Prior to that, he referred to United’s season as sh*t and questioned why he didn’t play more than a cameo in the Europa League final, which the Red Devils lost to Tottenham.",
      "There’s a lot of speculation over his exit, with Ruben Amorim reported to have told Garnacho: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "According to The Sun, the winger has chosen Chelsea as his next destination, having reportedly told his agent to make it clear he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge.",
      "A source told the site: “Alejandro knows the Premier League is the best in the world. And while he has had some good moments at United, he wants to establish himself as a world star.",
      "“England is the best place to do that and Chelsea have assembled a lot of good young players.”",
      "But the suggestion that Garnacho’s United career is over has been supported, with it also said: “Garnacho seems to think he’s the next Ronaldo and this was his ‘exit interview’ moment, like he wanted to annoy people so much that there was no option but to sell him.",
      "“It’s not gone down well with the rest of the players. “There is a feeling that while he’s a good player, he’s not quite as good as he thinks he is.”",
      "Whether Garnacho will get his preferred move remains to be seen. Chelsea were certainly interested in him in January, but he ended up remaining with United.",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk have recently stated that the Blues are not out of the picture, but could find the transfer hard to come by given United would rather not strengthen another Premier League side.",
      "Whether they would let Garnacho go to another side if they were so desperate to sell and knew there were no other options is another question.",
      "However, there are other options for the Argentine. Multiple reports have suggested that Napoli are big fans of Garnacho, while Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan have recently joined the race for him.",
      "United might look more favourably upon one of those sides if they don’t want to sell to a league rival.",
      "Man Utd players were “fuming” at being forced to go on a post-season tour of Asia which included three stars being told not to “flip the finger to fans”.",
      "According to reports, new Bayer Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag is plotting a raid on former club Manchester United as he looks to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’.",
      "Man Utd are willing to offer a ‘compromise’ to Napoli as they look to conclude a ‘quick’ deal for Alejandro Garnacho’s exit, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have been ‘contacted’ by the representatives of a Manchester United player looking to leave this summer."

      "Ruben Amorim lost the Europa League final to a historically bad Tottenham side and himself said he was willing to leave “without conversation or compensation” if he was not wanted by Manchester United.",
      "In truth he will surely be given a summer to build a squad closer to something that suits his formation.",
      "So who could take over at Manchester United; we have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "9=) Zinedine Zidane\nPeople keep trying to make Zinedine Zidane to United happen. It’s not going to happen.",
      "",
      "9=) Roberto De Zerbi\nThe current Marseille manager will remain high on any list of possible managers for any big Premier League club because he ‘knows the league’, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "6=) Unai Emery\nMight be the one high-profile Premier League manager for whom the Man United job holds more appeal than Man City. He’s already had one crack at replacing a Big Six legend whose fingerprints are all over the club. At least with United he’s a good few steps removed from all that. But swapping what he’s got going at Villa for United would still be a questionable move.",
      "",
      "6=) Marco Silva\nHas done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) Kieran McKenna\nHis agent played a blinder as reported interest from Manchester United and Chelsea led to a four-year contract at Ipswich that made him one of the best-paid managers in the Premier League. But would United fans really countenance the appointment of a relegated manager?",
      "",
      "4) Thomas Frank\nLinked with Tottenham and somehow that feels more likely than the big old leap to Manchester United from the safety and low expectations of Brentford, who really don’t care that he plays direct football. He was the favourite of Dan Ashworth but he is long gone.",
      "",
      "3) Gareth Southgate\nVery strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen. He said as recently as October: “I won’t coach in the next year for sure, I’m certain of that. I need to give myself time to make good decisions. When you come out of a really big role you need to give your body time, you need to give your mind time. I’m enjoying my life, so there’s no rush.”",
      "That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "2) Mauricio Pochettino\nChelsea chose the path of abject stupidity and it appeared to leave the path clear for United to pounce on a manager they had coveted back in his Tottenham days. They decided to eschew that option in favour of sticking with what’s been working so very well for them.",
      "Any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision making during this season are for now much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job.",
      "",
      "1) Oliver Glasner\nThat FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has led the Austrian to be one of the favourites for the Spurs job and now top of the list here…",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is running the risk of falling out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim over Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United continue to dominate the narrative and there is a new name touted as a potential manager in Saturday’s Mailbox…",
      "A former Manchester United star has revealed his main ‘fear’ with Ruben Amorim as the ‘jury is out’ on the under-fire Red Devils head coach.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "Man Utd hero Patrice Evra has hit out at the Red Devils fans over their “disgusting” treatment of one player as Amorim claims his side “choke in every game”.",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him."

      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League this season. The campaign will surely go down as one of the worst in their history.",
      "One of the only shining lights was Bruno Fernandes, who was directly involved in 39 goals in an otherwise below-par side.",
      "There has been a lot of speculation about his future, with the attacking midfielder courted by the Saudi Pro League at the minute, having reportedly had ‘positive talks’ with Al-Hilal.",
      "Former Premier League midfielder Murphy does not feel Fernandes can be allowed to leave.",
      "Writing in the Daily Mail, he stated it is ‘imperative’ that the midfielder stays at United, as if not, and he kicks off next season in Saudi Arabia, the ‘consequences will be devastating’ for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Murphy has praised Fernandes for wanting to ‘stand up and be counted during a terribly difficult period’. He also stated that the recent successes of the club, reaching cup finals, is ‘down to Bruno’.",
      "The pundit suggests that the sale of Fernandes, who is 30 and would surely command a giant fee makes ‘financial sense’ but from a performance perspective he is ‘irreplaceable’.",
      "Indeed, though United want to sign a new striker, and the sale would help to finance that, whoever is signed would be ‘far less effective without having the wonderful passes and crosses Bruno would provide’ per Murphy.",
      "Speculation over Fernandes’ exit has been ramped up given Cristiano Ronaldo is being eyed by Al-Hilal, who wants Fernandes to join him ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "Insider Graeme Bailey said: “Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "According to reports, Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal think an ‘agreement is close’ for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes amid one ‘key factor’.",
      "Real Madrid legend Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly told Al-Hilal that they will need to sign Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes holds the key to the Red Devils’ potential efforts to sign Victor Osimhen in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is running the risk of falling out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim over Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes is ‘very close’ to leaving Old Trafford for Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",
      "Youri Tielemans and Luis Enrique have been speaking to the press ahead of Aston Villa’s huge Champions League clash with Paris-Saint Germain."

      "It’s not all Man Utd doom and gloom\nI get all the doom and gloom around United these days, but I don’t see the picture is as bad as people make out.",
      "Sure, United are in a bad place, primarily down to utterly appalling recruitment over the past 8-10-12 years, but the club isn’t dead just yet.",
      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",
      "But that didn’t stop Bournemouth, Forest, Fulham, Villa (to name but a few) all climbing the table in recent seasons.",
      "Forest were many pundits’ picks for relegation last year, and having unearthed (amongst others) two very cheap diamonds in central defense, pushed for the top 4 until the very last game of the season. Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",
      "The point being, just because we cant have a summer of getting all the current fad names, doesn’t mean we’re done and dusted. Ok, I agree that the squad needs some decent additions, but at least our transfer business is getting better.",
      "6-8 years ago, we’d go and pay crazy money for names like Pogba and Di Maria, and then get frustrated when they didn’t return value. And fill in the gaps with loans of Falcao etc. Yuk.",
      "2-4 years ago was utterly disastrous – Sancho, Antony, (if Greenwood hadn’t smacked his girlfriend, we’d have saved £150m not having to buy those two), Hojlund (nowhere near value, but think he’s been unlucky, if still below average). I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",
      "Last season – far better. Mazraoui, good value. De Ligt – meh, at least we didn’t pay 75, 40 was probably about right if he can stay fit. Yoro – looks a decent player and will only improve. Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",
      "Amorim’s only signings so far: Dorgu – I’ve seen fans moaning about him cos he’s not playing like peak Roberto Carlos. The kid is 20 years old ….. what is it with people nowadays. He will get better, stronger, brighter. And Heaven, £1.5m for an 18 year old who already looks pretty useful, definitely great value.",

      "Bruno for £100m? Really?\nAshmundo says Utd shouldn’t sell Bruno for less than £100m. He is 30 years old, good for Utd but not quite as good as Utd fans think he is, surely even the Saudi league wouldn’t pay that sort of money for him.",
      "Outside the PL and probably Portugal I’m not sure he is even that big a name, and there is no way any of the top teams in the PL would be interested in him.",
      "I suppose it could be a way for some Saudi investor to gain favour with the club.\nMel – Dublin, Berlin, Athlone Town",

      "Spurs and pointless transfer talk\nI can’t help but think “who can Spurs buy now we have CL?” Which is pointless as we don’t know if we will have the same manager.",
      "That said; with Villa in financial strife and Forest not making the CL those two clubs have four players I would be all over; Gibbs-White, Tielemans, Rodgers and Murillo. Not all of them as they’ll cost a king’s ransom but I can see at least one big names from both sides being snapped up.",
      "Bournemouth aren’t desperate for cash anymore but Semenyo is a terrific player, however if Kerkez does go along with Huijsen then I can’t see a world where they sell their three best players.",
      "Joao Paulinha isn’t enjoying life in Munich, we should be all over a player like that; experienced and durable in that tricky no. 6 role.",
      "Then there are the dream players; Wharton, Eze and Lacroix have all been exceptional at Palace (Glasner too 😬) and maybe it is the season they cash in on Eze…or, f*ck it; bring in Nico Williams and Sesko.",

      "Are promoted clubs really screwed?\nThere’s been a lot of discussion, especially on this website, about how the PL is becoming a closed shop and the gap is widening etc etc. Apparently the 3 promoted clubs are already doomed before they even kick a football!",
      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling. And they shouldn’t be blaming the Premier League for that.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "And Barca sporting director Deco admitted earlier this month that Diaz and Rashford are two players that the La Liga side are looking at.",
      "Speaking to RAC1, Deco said: “Talking about players who have contracts with other clubs is complicated out of respect. We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players. When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.",
      "“Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home, renewals of Pedri, Gavi, Araujo, Raphinha, Kounde… I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine is the best signing in history.",

      "A deal for Rashford or Diaz will be expensive for Barcelona to complete with the Catalan giants still sorting their finances out after years of struggles.",
      "And now Spanish publication Sport claims that Barcelona’s ‘plan is to try a loan’ for Man Utd forward Rashford as the La Liga outfit ‘aren’t willing to shell out the roughly €40 million the Red Devils are asking for.’",

      "Yann Sommer\nSommer was very high on Manchester United’s shortlist to replace David De Gea in the summer of 2023, and although Bayern Munich swooped in the January window to ruin the Red Devils’ chances of a free transfer, it was Inter who then took advantage of a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with the Bundesliga club to secure his £6m signing as a replacement for the guy United bought for £44m as their new No.1.",
      "And while Sommer has played a vital role in securing Inter’s place in the Champions League final, pulling off several remarkable saves in the knockout stages, United got to the Europa League final in spite of Andre Onana, who then definitely could have done better to deny Brennan Johnson his winning goal for Tottenham.",

      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",

      "It is said United will ‘make checks’ over whether Kolo Muani would be an ideal fit, after they considered recruiting him in January, when he went on loan to Juventus – he scored eight goals in 16 Serie A games there.",
      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",
      "As such Mateta has come back into their thinking, especially after playing a key role in Palace winning the FA Cup. He assisted a goal in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa, while the Palace man has been in electric form in the Premier League recently.",
      "This season, Mateta scored 14 goals and assisted two. The report places him at £40million, though our friends at TEAMtalk suggest the Eagles would not let him go for less than £50million.",
      "They state that negotiations could be tricky, as Palace are keen to retain Mateta. He will play European football with them for the first time in his career, and that’s something which is not on offer at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign a PL star as one of four ‘fallback’ striker options as Omar Berrada’s relationship with an agent hampers a £63m deal.",

      "Club football is back! Hurrah! But the Premier League isn’t! Boo! But that’s because it’s FA Cup quarter-final weekend! Hurrah!",
      "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta has commented on his injury after his “ear was destroyed” in a clash with Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts.",
      "With the end of season in sight, the race for Champions League qualification could be huge for Newcastle United in the fates of two strikers."

      "Sunday 1 June 2025 16:34, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",

      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Bruno Fernandes is yet to make a decision on his future with Al Hilal willing to pay Man Utd £100m for their captain and nearly treble his wages; the potential sale poses a dilemma with the club in need of a cash injection to fund their rebuild but also so reliant on Fernandes",
      "Sunday 1 June 2025 19:13, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has often been relied upon as Manchester United's saviour - so it is fitting his parting gift could end up being one last rescue act.",
      "United always knew sales would be required this summer to create enough financial flexibility to reshape the squad for Ruben Amorim. Selling Fernandes was not part of that plan, the captain's future a widely presumed certainty until Al Hilal came to the table.",
      "Despite the Saudis' willingness to pay £100m for a player turning 31 in September, United and Amorim want to keep Fernandes. The United boss believes the midfielder wants to stay, though he could not guarantee he would. But can the club afford to turn this down?",
      "Such an offer is unlikely to come again given Fernandes' age. The windfall would be transformative for United ahead of a summer when the budget is pinched, and an overhaul is so dearly required. Fernandes' sale could kick-start a new chapter for the club.",
      "This rationale only holds up under the assumption that the funds would be spent wisely and, for a club with such a poor record in recruitment, it would be a huge gamble. No wonder there is scepticism. Go backwards again and relegation looms.",
      "Old Trafford has become a graveyard for stars over the last decade - Fernandes one of the few shining exceptions - and although INEOS are not to blame for that legacy, it highlights how tricky it would be to replace the club's best signing since Robin van Persie.",
      "We all know Fernandes is a production machine, but he has also become a leader. Imperfect, certainly. United's captain tends to try too hard when things go wrong - to his and the team's detriment. But where would they be without him?",
      "Well, United have not won a Premier League match without Fernandes since March 2022. The sample size is small, yet the record is telling. Six matches, five defeats and one draw. In a squad lacking in character and quality, Fernandes brings both in abundance.",
      "Fernandes' departure would rid United of their one elite player and surely make Old Trafford an even less attractive destination. Liam Delap has already chosen Chelsea over United. Finding adequate replacements is hard enough without Champions League.",
      "Emotionally, in a summer when academy graduates Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho appear set for the chop, on the back of hundreds of redundancies and the worst season for decades, the loss of Fernandes could bring the fanbase to its knees.",
      "In the context of the past year - and the past decade - when the club has been accused of losing touch with its identity, losing Fernandes would make United nearly unrecognisable heading into a summer that could become make or break for INEOS.",
      "If this were another club, it would be easier to predict how they might handle a similar scenario without such a glum outlook. The Philippe Coutinho comparison - although flawed - is an example of how a well-run club can sell a star to improve the collective.",
      "Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker were signed by Liverpool using the £146m fee paid by Barcelona. Their additions proved transformational for Jurgen Klopp, who would win the Champions League and Premier League in the next three years.",
      "Liverpool were further along in their rebuild, but the example offers a blueprint for how United could enjoy a similar transformation if Fernandes leaves. With a goalkeeper, central midfielder and striker dearly needed, £100m could fund a new spine for the team.",
      "Matheus Cunha, undeterred by the lack of European football, is already through the door. If others share his faith in the project remains to be seen, though the signing, sealed on day one of the window, suggests INEOS might be starting to figure things out.",
      "They will hope that is true after spending £200m in their first summer and taking the club from eighth in the table to 15th. Erik ten Hag was still in charge then though and the window had his fingerprints all over it with two more former Ajax players recruited.",
      "Now INEOS have another year under their belt and Amorim in place with a system that he has made clear will not change, the conditions certainly appear more conducive to a better window and the early signs are good.",
      "Cunha, 26, is one of a handful of Premier League-proven players United have signed while in their prime in the post Sir Alex Ferguson era - and if this is a sign of things to come, then INEOS are at least working to right the wrongs of the past.",
      "But funding moves for such players does not come cheap and could be difficult if Fernandes is not sold. Cunha, for instance, was £62.5m. Reports suggest that is more than half of the budget gone without any sales.",
      "If Fernandes stayed, risks would have to be taken on unknown quantities that suit Amorim's system, or he would have to put up with the current crop for longer. For a coach that could quickly come under pressure next season, neither sounds too appealing.",
      "But nor does losing Fernandes, and therein lies the dilemma. United want him to stay, so too does Amorim. The final decision, it seems, lies with Fernandes, who no one could blame for leaving after all he has put up with.",
      "United cannot afford to sell their captain but nor can they afford to turn down Al Hilal's offer."

      "Chelsea will now discuss personal terms with the player's representatives, with discussions expected to be a formality ahead of an eventual medical.",
      "Champions League football is not the main reason Delap is joining Chelsea. Instead, the style of play, a young squad, opportunities to play, the likelihood of being able to challenge for major trophies together for years to come and relationships with people already at Chelsea are understood to have played a part.",
      "Delap watched Chelsea's Conference League final win over Real Betis and was very impressed with the second-half performance.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."
