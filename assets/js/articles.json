      "Manchester United and Leeds United step up their preparations for the new season when they meet in Stockholm on Saturday. The Red Devils are looking to rebuild under Ruben Amorim following their poorest domestic campaign in more than half a century.",
      "Meanwhile, Leeds are gearing up for their return to the top flight after pipping Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference. However, rather than Old Trafford or Elland Road, the Swedish capital will host the match between these historic rivals.",
      "Man United have made numerous pre-season trips to Sweden over the years, while both clubs have sizeable fan bases in Scandinavia. The club met in the region just two years ago, with Man United winning 2-0 in Oslo. Here’s the lowdown on the match, including kick-off time and how to watch…",
      "The friendly will be played at the 50,000-capacity Strawberry Arena, the country's national stadium, where the Red Devils defeated Ajax in the 2017 Europa League final. It will kick-off at the unusual time of 2pm.",
      "Alternatively, the channel can be purchased directly from the club at £7.99 per month or £29.99 per year, allowing fans to stream the game on their mobile devices. Build-up will begin an hour before kick-off.",
      "Leeds fans can watch the game via their club's streaming service, LUTV, with match passes costing £4.99.",
      "As the Red Devils continue their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo, having made an improved £70million bid for the Brentford forward, a number of other players will make their debut against Leeds, including £62.5m signing from the Wolves, Matheus Cunha.",
      "Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon, 18, who has linked up with his new team-mates after his transfer was agreed back in January, could also be involved. Goalkeeper Andre Onana will miss the match with a hamstring issue, while Lisandro Martinez is continuing his recovery from a serious knee injury.",
      "Leeds' new signings Jaka Bijol, Gabriel Gudmundsson, Sebastiaan Bornauw and Lukas Nmecha could also be involved in the match.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag suffered a disastrous start to life at Bayer Leverkusen - after they were humiliated by Flamengo's Under-20 team.",
      "In his first game back in management since being sacked by United last year, Ten Hag - who took over from Xabi Alonso at Leverkusen last month - saw his side humbled and embarrassed in Brazil, beaten 5-1. It was his first game in the dugout since being dismissed by United last October.",
      "He witnessed his new squad being soundly defeated by the Brazilian team. German media outlet Bild labelled the match 'a debacle'.",
      "Leverkusen may still be adjusting to life without Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Jonathan Tah, all of whom left the Bundesliga side at the end of the season and had been key players during their title winning triumph of 2023-24, and it was only a friendly. But my word.",
      "Leverkusen were able to field Mark Flekken, Jonas Hofmann, Victor Boniface and ex-United defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah in the starting XI for the friendly in Rio de Janeiro. However, the Bundesliga team found themselves 2-0 down within the first ten minutes of the match, before Flamengo were 4-0 up at half-time.",
      "Flekken and Boniface were substituted off with just 36 minutes on the clock, with Niklas Lomb and Alejo Sarco their replacements. A sign perhaps that, already, all is not well.",
      "Montrell Culbreath netted a consolation goal for Leverkusen in the dying minutes of their pre-season friendly.",
      "Ten Hag's next assignment with Leverkusen is a warm-up match against German outfit Bochum next Saturday.",
      "\"The result looks bad, but I don't really care about results in preseason,\" he remarked. \"We should never lose, even by a large margin, but it was important to me not to lose any players.",
      "\"It would have been better to play the game later.\"",

      "Things are really hotting up across the summer transfer window right now, both in the Premier League and across Europe.",
      "At Manchester United, the Ruben Amorim rebuild has gone at somewhat a slower pace than expected, but Bryan Mbeumo is now closing in on his move, with a £70m deal with Brentford agreed for the Cameroon star. What United need to do though is start moving players out - particularly the five members of Amorim's 'bomb squad'.",
      "Liverpool have already splashed over £220m so far and are in negotiations with Eintracht Frankfurt for Hugo Ekitike after effectively bullying Newcastle out of a move for the French striker.",
      "At Arsenal, Noni Madueke became their fourth summer signing on Friday night and is promising trophies after arriving from Chelsea. Viktor Gyokeres negotiations are ongoing as they hammer out the finer points with Sporting Lisbon, but the Gunners' fifth summer signing has already been leaked.",
      "Elsewhere, Newly-promoted Leeds United are making moves, Sean Longstaff becoming their fifth summer signing, Wolves are closing on a Colombia international and a shock bid has been made for Manchester City's Ederson.",
      "So, Arsenal completed Noni Madueke's deal last night as their fourth summer signing.",
      "But there was one big error made as photos were uploaded to Getty Images that fans were very quick to spot.",
      "Mainly, because it appeared to leak signing No.5",
      "Celtic have had a lot of joy with players from the Far East in recent seasons, and now they've signed Shin Yamada from Japanese J League side Kawasaki Frontale.",
      "Shin, 25, recently won his first senior Japan cap. He has scored 32 goals in 121 appearances for Kawasaki Frontale, the same club that Reo Hatate played for before joining Celtic.",
      "Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said: “I am really pleased that we have brought Shin to the club. He is a strong player who can score goals and create goals for others and I think he is someone who can definitely add an important dimension to our forward line.",
      "\"I know he is really keen to make his mark here in European football and deliver for Celtic and I think he is someone who has the power, athleticism and intensity in his play to do really well for us. I look forward to working with him.\"",

      "He was later asked if Romero were to leave would he push for a new centre-back to replace the two-time Copa America winner.",
      "“But it’s like a theory. Right now he’s here, that’s what I’m focusing on,\" he said. \"As long as players are here, I’m training them, I’m playing with them.",
      "\"He’s definitely here and very committed. I know he’s looking forward to the season.\"",
      "Modou Kéba Cissé has agreed to join Aston Villa from LASK Linz in Austria.",
      "The 19-year-old has signed a pre-contract deal to join the Villans next summer, keeping him with his current club this term.",
      "He broke into the LASK side last year, making 10 senior appearances, scoring once.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been desperate to get his exit from Sporting sorted and he is now close to getting his wish. Arsenal have finally agreed terms with the Portuguese club over a €73.5million (£63.5m) transfer fee - and Gyokeres is packing his bags.",
      "A removal van was shown outside Gyokeres' house on Portuguese television on Thursday, with Record confirming the authenticity of the images and reporting that the Swede sent a friend to oversee the process.",
      "Talks are continuing between the two clubs and Gyokeres' representatives over the finer details of the transfer, but it is clearly close. Once the deal is completed, the 27-year-old could fly out to join his new team-mates on their pre-season tour.",
      "Arsenal’s £48million arrival Noni Madueke said his new club are capable of winning it all after leaving Chelsea to become Mikel Arteta’s fourth signing of the summer.",
      "Madueke’s controversial move across London, which provoked a backlash from some Arsenal supporters, takes the club’s spending to beyond £120million so far.",
      "Madueke said: “I’m somebody who goes with my gut feeling a lot of the time and I feel like it’s steered me in the right direction so far. So I don’t think it’s going to be any different here. I think it’s going to be a great success and I’m really happy to be here.",
      "“It’s already a great team with a clear identity and I can’t wait to bring my style to the team and try and help the boys as much as possible to take that next step. (I want) to win all the competitions we’re in, I feel like we’re definitely capable of doing that.”",

      "Newcastle have been chasing Trafford - who shone in the Clarets promotion season - for 12 months and have been negotiating, but a deal in excess of £30m still hasn't been agreed.",
      "Now, as first reported by the Daily Mail, their frustrations are set to see them give up and turn attentions elsewhere.",
      "In their place, City are looking to swoop, two years after letting Trafford move to Turf Moor and are looking to pay less than their £40m buy-out clause.",
      "An interesting twist. Never really understood why Newcastle were so keen with Nick Pope already in situ.",
      "Noni Madueke completed his £52m move from Chelsea to Arsenal on Friday night.",
      "The Gunners have splashed £48m - plus £4m in add-ons - to sign the England winger to provide competition down both flanks.",
      "But ex-Arsenal star Paul Merson says he's \"shocked\" by the move.",
      "\"I'm shocked. If Arsenal went and bought any player from Chelsea, he'd have been the last one I thought they'd sign. I just don't see it. It's a lot of money for a player who is not a prolific goalscorer. He's the sort of player that has a good game here and a good game there, but that'll be it.",
      "\"The consistency of performance isn't there. I hope he proves me wrong, but he'll have the good games, just like he did for England last month. But then you won't see him for a few weeks.\"",
      "On Friday Manchester United agreed a £70million deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It'll see United pay £65m for the Cameroon international, with a further £5m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo has always wanted United, has agreed personal terms, so it's just a matter of when.",
      "And that should be in the coming days, with Ruben Amorim keen to have him on board for the club's pre-season tour of the United States.",

      "Starting with one of Friday's more puzzling offers.",
      "Galatasaray have offered Manchester City £2.7m for Ederson, according to multiple reports.",
      "He's still City's No.1, but only has one year left on his deal at the Etihad and it's no secret City are looking around for a replacement for the Brazilian international.",
      "But surely that offer isn't going to tempt them into selling!",
      "Welcome everyone to another day in transfer land.",

      "Brentford have agreed a deal worth up to £71m for the Cameroon international and he will join the tour to the US which begins next week.",
      "But the 29-man squad named by United for the meeting with rivals Leeds in Sweden features only Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon as new arrivals, with a quintet of big names looking to be sold left at home including Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Here is what to look out for and how to watch as the new season moves a step closer.",
      "While the wait to see Mbeumo will drag on until the American series, Matheus Cunha is in line to make his debut having already been handed the No10 shirt vacated by Marcus Rashford. And excitement is high that the Brazilian will thrive from the off after a £62.5m move from Wolves.",
      "Amorim’s squad had problems running through it last season but chief among them was the lack of firepower up front.",
      "Cunha can bring both goals and the intensity required to shine in Amorim’s system.",
      "Reports suggest Diego Leon is already impressing on the training pitch and considering the club indicated he would flit between the first team and underage set up as he gets up to speed with English football.",
      "A good display here could see him veer much closer to remaining with the former once the season proper gets going.",
      "There are 10 youngsters in the squad including Toby Collyer, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson and Ethan Williams.",
      "And with Joshua Zirkzee still recovering from injury and Rasmus Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt amid interest from clubs in Serie A, there appears a chance of Obi to make a big case for a much bigger opportunity.",
      "Amorim was quickly criticised from some quarters for his determination to stick to his system rather than adapt to specific situations.",
      "Will he show any signs of moving away from his structure here or will he stick with his tried and tested and believe that his squad can improve their ability to carry out his specific instructions as the next four weeks before the new Premier League season begins progresses?",
      "Rare is the club game that gets heated in mid-July so it will be interesting to see whether these two rivals get stuck in.",
      "When they face off in early January in the first league meeting of the season it will get very tasty. Do not rule out a meaty tackle or two here, though.",
      "The game gets underway at 2pm and will be shown live on MUTV.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United are ready to ramp up their interest in Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens as they make plans after it was confirmed that No 1 Andre Onana will be ruled out for weeks with a hamstring injury.",
      "Antwerp have slapped a £17million price tag on the Belgian star amid interest from the Premier League giants. Onana's injury means he will miss the entirety of pre-season and he is in a race against time to feature in the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United had been linked with a change in between the sticks as Onana continues to struggle for consistency. Ever since joining from Inter Milan for an initial fee of £44million in 2023, he's been error-prone with several of his mistakes leading directly to goals.",
      "There was talk of the club scouring the market for a new No 1 but the fitness issues with Onana mean that Ruben Amorim has little choice but to go after another goalkeeper and talkSPORT reports they are ready to pursue Lammens.",
      "The goalkeeper himself admits he was overawed when he learnt of the interest from the Manchester side but believes the way he plays would suit English football.",
      "\"The first time I heard I thought, 'Wow',\" he said. \"Immediately a world [renowned] team that follows you. That is special. Of course, I was also spoken to about it a lot and when I made a save in training, it was United this, United that [from colleagues]… It's only positive.",
      "\"Especially because it's the best competition in the world and my profile, my stature and way of playing, is similar to English football. You have to physically hold your own there and that suits me.\"",
      "It has been reported previously that United would be willing to take a £20m hit on Onana to ensure he gets a move away. The Cameroonian goalkeeper sees his future up in the air following a tricky couple of campaigns at Old Trafford.",
      "AS Monaco and Saudi clubs have shown tentative interest but neither would be able to match United’s demands. Onana himself has no desire to quit the club and wants to prove that he can cut it.",
      "Nevertheless Red Devils chiefs would be willing to sell him for around £30m in an effort to get him off the wage bill if the opportunity arose. Amorim dropped Onana for a game last term at Newcastle, which came just days after a poor display at Lyon."

      "Bryan Mbeumo's £71m move to Manchester United has moved a step closer after Brentford agreed to sanction the sale of their top goalscorer.",
      "United had failed with two earlier bids for Mbeumo, 25, only for a third offer to be deemed acceptable by Bees chiefs. That will see Brentford receive £65m guaranteed, paid across four instalments, with £6m more to come in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo's representatives had already agreed personal terms with the Old Trafford hierarchy, paving the way for a move to be completed in the next couple of days pending the completion of a medical.",
      "The Cameroon international had also had keen interest from Tottenham Hotspur, a move that would have seen him follow the path taken by head coach Thomas Frank last month.",
      "But he will instead be joining up with United.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s hard line stance over Manchester United’s unwanted players does not have complete approval from the club’s staff. United have placed Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia in the ‘bomb squad’ while they try to sell them – but the decision has caused divisions.",
      "The five players have been told they have no future under Amorim at United and are therefore seeking transfers to other clubs. Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been isolated from the first-team squad, forced to train separately in order to draw a line between the two groups.",
      "The Athletic reports that the bomb squad approach is contentious inside the club, with some worried it sends the wrong message. There is also the fact that making it obvious the players are unwanted risks lowering their transfer value, especially as the September 1 transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Aston Villa are the latest club to signal their interest in Manchester United outcast Alejandro Garnacho. The winger is expected to depart the Red Devils before the end of the transfer window and is not part of Ruben Amorim's plans.",
      "The Argentina international, who was available for sale in January, was told to find a new club by the Portuguese head coach after Garnacho was publicly critical of the decision to not select him to start in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. As a result, Garnacho has not been part of United's pre-season plans.",
      "Instead the winger has been told he can report to Carrington for training from 5pm, after the first team have completed their training. Thus far, United have not been able to facilitate a transfer for any of the players they want to sell.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo's £71m move to Manchester United has moved a step closer after Brentford agreed to sanction the sale of their top goalscorer.",
      "United had failed with two earlier bids for Mbeumo, 25, only for a third offer to be deemed acceptable by Bees chiefs. That will see Brentford receive £65m guaranteed, paid across four instalments, with £6m more to come in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo's representatives had already agreed personal terms with the Old Trafford hierarchy, paving the way for a move to be completed in the next couple of days pending the completion of a medical.",
      "The Cameroon international had also had keen interest from Tottenham Hotspur, a move that would have seen him follow the path taken by head coach Thomas Frank last month.",
      "But he has always preferred a move to United, despite the club not being in Europe this season and Spurs returning to the Champions League, and made his intention clear to all parties while continuing to train as normal at the start of pre-season.",
      "United's initial bids of £45m and £55m upfront were swiftly rejected by Brentford, whose view was that they should hold out for more than what United paid Wolves for the Brazilian Matheus Cunha at the beginning of the transfer window. United have also signed young full back Diego Leon from the Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 goals and added eight assists having played in every league game for Brentford last season. He joined the club in 2019 and was a vital part of their promotion from the Championship.",
      "United begin their pre-season campaign with a friendly against Leeds United in Stockholm on Saturday afternoon before heading to America. While Stateside they will face West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton before hosting Fiorentina a week before the new season kicks off.",
      "Ruben Amorim is not expected to include several players who have been given permission to find new clubs in his travelling party. That includes Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and winger Antony.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Bryan Mbeumo was once backed to leave Brentford for a Premier League giant by his old manager, Thomas Frank. Mbeumo has been at the centre of a protracted transfer saga this summer, with Manchester United desperate to secure the services of the 25-year-old forward.",
      "United have now tabled a third offer for the Cameroonian international, believed to be £65million plus £5m in performance-related add-ons. United have previously failed with two bids for Brentford's star man but are hoping to strike lucky with their latest offer.",
      "Mbeumo has already agreed personal terms with United. He has also informed Brentford, and the other clubs chasing him, that he doesn't want to move anywhere else, having rejected both Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "Brentford have yet to respond to United's latest bid. However, comments in 2024 made by the Bees' ex-coach Frank, who has since joined Spurs and made a play for his ex-striker, will give Mbeumo a huge confidence boost should he make the move to Old Trafford. The Dane claimed last year: \"I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "Frank has been backing Mbeumo to succeed for some time. After the striker missed a chunk of action two seasons ago due to injury, his manager's remarks spoke volumes that he believes the goalscorer can cut it anywhere. Mbeumo's contributions were sorely missed at the time while he was on the treatment table.",
      "\"He [Mbeumo] was our biggest miss for four months last year, even with [Former Brentford striker, Ivan] Toney out,\" Frank said. \"He was our key player and has added another layer this season with five goals in six games.\"",
      "He continued: \"That's incredible and he's creating chances. He's a top player. I'm convinced he will play for a bigger club. I'd buy him if I was at a bigger club.\"",
      "The ongoing saga has not been ideal for United. Ruben Amorim reportedly wanted all his new recruits signed up before he and his squad fly to the USA next week for their pre-season tour.",
      "Matheus Cunha is United's only new arrival so far. The club's previous bids for Mbeumo - £45m plus £10m in add-ons and £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses - were rejected, as Brentford believe Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, should command a higher fee than the £62.5m United paid Wolves to sign Cunha.",
      "Yet the optics around the deal are harming United, so says former Red Devils defender Rio Ferdinand, who was speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "\"[Mbeumo] has told Tottenham, he's told Brentford that he only wants to join Manchester United. So Man United and Brentford have to come together and find a way of... well, Man United have to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation,\" Ferdinand said.",
      "\"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? So, I'll be surprised if this deal doesn't go through, because Man United have been adamant.\""

      "Manchester United are hoping to have completed the signing of Bryan Mbeumo before they head off to the United States on their pre-season tour. United submitted a third bid for the Brentford forward on Thursday and are confident of concluding the prolonged negotiations in the coming days.",
      "There is now a £70million bid on the table for Brentford, made up of £65m plus £5m in add-ons. United consider it a take-it-or-leave-it offer that they have made after growing frustrated with the Bees’ hard ball negotiating tactics.",
      "The main reason behind the sudden escalation in bidding is that United want Mbeumo to be a part of their pre-season tour to the US. Ruben Amorim and his players will jet over the Atlantic on Tuesday, after playing Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday in their first pre-season friendly.",
      "Matheus Cunha is the only summer signing currently being integrated into the squad during training sessions at Carrington, having completed his £62.5m move from Wolves early in the window. Diego Leon, an 18-year-old Paraguayan left-back, is another new arrival, although his deal went through in January.",
      "Leon is among one of the players hoping to catch Amorim’s eye ahead of the trip to the US, where matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton await. The Athletic reports that a decision is yet to be made over Leon’s status in the squad, or whether he will drop down to the under-21s, given there is competition at left-back from Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Harry Amass.",
      "Meanwhile, there are four other young players in the same position as Leon. United academy graduates Bendito Mantato, Shea Lacey, Sekou Kone and Elyh Harrison have all been training with the first team at Carrington recently and are hoping to earn a place on the plane to the US.",
      "Harrison, a 19-year-old goalkeeper, has a good chance with Andre Onana still on the comeback from an injury. The others are currently in limbo, with club staff in talks with the representatives of various academy players over possible loan moves for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Amorim is still yet to decide who he wants to keep and who would be better served by leaving for game time. It is understood that Dan Gore, Ethan Wheatley, Tyler Fredricson and Toby Collyer could all leave in the coming weeks, either on loan or permanently, with United keen to clear the pathway from academy to first team.",
      "United begin their pre-season against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday before the squad travels to the USA, where they will take part in the Premier League Summer Series. They will face West Ham in New Jersey on July 27, before games against Bournemouth and Everton in Chicago and Atlanta.",
      "United will then play Fiorentina at Old Trafford in their final pre-season game on August 9, before starting their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17."

      "Ruben Amorim’s hard line stance over Manchester United’s unwanted players does not have complete approval from the club’s staff. United have placed Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia in the ‘bomb squad’ while they try to sell them – but the decision has caused divisions.",
      "The five players have been told they have no future under Amorim at United and are therefore seeking transfers to other clubs. Rashford, Garnacho, Antony, Sancho and Malacia have been isolated from the first-team squad, forced to train separately in order to draw a line between the two groups.",
      "They are ordered to arrive at Carrington after 5pm, when the rest of the players have left for the day. While not unheard of in elite football, it is a brutal way of dealing with unwanted players and it is yet to bear fruit, with United struggling to sell the five players.",
      "Rashford is holding out for a move to Barcelona, Garnacho’s £70million valuation has put off Napoli, Real Betis want Antony but can’t afford him, Sancho has been shopped around without luck so far and Malacia is unattractive after a series of injuries.",
      "The Athletic reports that the bomb squad approach is contentious inside the club, with some worried it sends the wrong message. There is also the fact that making it obvious the players are unwanted risks lowering their transfer value, especially as the September 1 transfer deadline approaches.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m, and given him Rashford’s No.10 shirt, but negotiations for Bryan Mbeumo have dragged on. The club needs to offload Rashford, who earns £325,000-a-week, Garnacho and Sancho in order to free up space in the squad and provide more funds for transfers.",
      "“It's just the players and the mentality of some of them, who simply have to leave. You need players who will run through brick walls and who won't question, but will just get on with it.",
      "“You can question certain things, but go and see the manager if you've not played, have it out in his office. Don't do it in the press or on social media. You see some of the stuff that's out there and it's so disrespectful, what some of the players are doing.",
      "“You look at some of the players and their body language, and I think I'd much rather have 10 average players who will work their socks off than these prima-donnas who don't care.”"

      "Ruben Amorim has been chasing the Brentford frontman for weeks, but has seen the saga drag on. Now the club have returned with a fresh package worth £70million, which they hope will be enough to get the Bees to finally cash in on their leading light.",
      "The Dane previously played and impressed in Italy, which convinced United to spend more than £70m on the unproven striker who was then at Atalanta. He's been unable to deliver consistently at Old Trafford and now a move back to Serie A could be on the cards.",
      "Hojlund has been linked with Inter Milan, but their San Siro rivals could now join the party. United will have to accept a considerable loss on their striker, but just how much they demand remains to be seen.",
      "Milan finished a disappointing eighth last term, meaning they are without European football. Christian Pulisic top scored for them with 17 goals but Tijjani Reijnders, who chipped in with 15 goals, has left for Manchester City and the Rossoneri are yet to sign a striker this summer.",
      "United's desire to add more firepower stems from the lack of goals in their team last term. They struggled in the final third and didn't have anyone in attack they could rely on to consistently come up trumps in front of goal. Hojlund scored just four Premier League goals last term.",
      "Amorim accepted that the player was short of expectations, but acknowledged he was bereft of confidence and claimed it was on the entire team to service him and help him out of his rut.",
      "\"I think if you look at the games we have several players that miss big chances, not just Rasmus,\" he said. \"Of course, Rasmus, the game is to score goals because he's a striker, but it's a team thing. I already said that. Our team should score more goals, it's not just Rasmus missing chances.\"",
      "Amorim also added: \"It's a team thing. Of course, we have an idea of what this team needs but also the guys we play with, we play at least three guys in front to score goals and we have midfielders that can. All the team needs to score more goals and you have opportunities with the midfielders and the striker. We need to improve as a team because if you don't score goals in this league it's impossible to win games.\""

      "Having made it clear that he wants to compete for a place in the first team, Leon is now trying to catch Amorim’s eye in pre-season. He is up against Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Amass in Amorim’s squad, a situation that appears to require some attention, especially if the rumours of interest in Brighton left-back Pervis Estupinian come to fruition.",

The Athletic reports that Amass could be sent out on loan, despite showing promise last season, with United keen to clear pathways from the academy to the first team.",

The Red Devils previously slapped a £70million price tag on Garnacho, but securing that sum may prove difficult given the public fallout surrounding the winger's situation at United.",
      "Such a hefty fee is also a big ask for a player who has yet to fully realise his potential. His tally of 11 goals across all competitions last season hardly warrants a £70m valuation, although any fee would provide pure profit for the club under profit and sustainability rules.",
      "The Reds are in dire need of a striker and Watkins' Premier League experience, a key factor for Ineos, makes him a great fit.",

      "Gore - who is known for having a bust-up with Anthony Martial during training - initially joined Rotherham in January but only played a total of three games in all competitions before suffering a foot fracture in training.",
      "The 20-year-old has long been earmarked as an outstanding youngster that could make his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford, but the midfielder has not yet had his moment and will hope to impress with Rotherham in the upcoming season.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Dan Gore has completed a second successive loan move to Rotherham United and is set to spend the 2025/26 season with the Millers.",
      "\"In January, he joined Rotherham for the first time and made three appearances as the South Yorkshire side finished 13th in League One. He’ll now hope to build on that in his second spell at the New York Stadium. Good luck, Dan!\"",
      "Gore reportedly had a row in training with Martial back in 2022 after being invited to take part in a session by former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The midfielder was hoping to catch the eye during a training session while the rest of his United team-mates were at the 2022 World Cup but is said to have clattered Martial during a strong challenge.",
      "It's claimed tempers boiled over between the pair, who were pulled apart, with heavy tackles on established first team stars forbidden in training. Martial reportedly apologised to Gore and the dispute was quashed.",
      "Gore will be hoping for better luck at Rotherham after his freak injury, which baffled manager Steve Evans after players were given light training regimes.",

      "“It’s unbelievable. We didn’t do enough in training for him to have a sore nose let alone a sore foot. Until I hear more from the medical staff as to how it’s happened and why it’s happened then it’s … maybe God will tell me when I go to sleep tonight.\"",
      "“The kid trained really well and didn’t feel a thing. He was going to play a big part for us and then, after he’d gone home, he spoke to the head of medical and said he was feeling his foot.",
      "\"Nobody is more devastated than me. I worked really hard to get him here. He had three clubs above us in League One who wanted but he chose us because of the football I convinced him he would get.\"",

      "There has been frustration over the low progress of discussions between the two clubs, but now United have submitted a third bid of £70m - hoping it can tempt Brentford into selling their star man.",
      "Mbeumo is keen on completing the move to Old Trafford and should the move come to fruition, it seems there will be an added incentive for the 25-year-old.",
      "He has always played in the No 19 shirt during his footballing career, having used the number for both Brentford and Cameroon on international duty.",
      "And if he joined United, he would be able to snap up that shirt number immediately because it is currently vacant.",
      "The last player who wore number 19 for United was defender Raphael Varane, who left the club last summer, joining Serie A side Como.",
      "It comes after United had two bids rejected for Mbeumo, the last one being worth around £62.5m - the same amount they paid to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "The Bees have been adamant that United should pay them more than they did for Cunha because Mbeumo outscored the Brazilian last season and is also the younger player.",
      "But a deal is now likely to be agreed after United paid Brentford's asking price for the player - who has already thrashed out personal terms.",
      "He has also told Brentford he doesn't want to join any other club despite links to Tottenham, who were interested in the forward after recruiting his former Bees boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Mbeumo netted an impressive 20 goals in the Premier League for Brentford last season and is one of the most sought-after players in the top flight. He has scored a total of 70 goals in 242 appearances for the team since 2019, having started off in the Championship.",

      "Matheus Cunha signed last month, Bryan Mbeumo will sign this month and Sir Dave Brailsford is being phased out. The road to recovery has begun smoothly for Manchester United.",
      "The club is making decisions they should be making. Mbeumo fit the bill two years ago and the smart move (and money) would have been to go for him last year when most eyes were fixed on his Brentford teammate, Ivan Toney.",
      "A source who has dealt with Mbeumo billed him as a \"terrific guy and a proper professional\". One of his close relatives was already a United fan, which helped matters despite Mbeumo's close relationship with Thomas Frank, who lobbied new club Tottenham to move for him.",
      "Brentford verbally accepted United's offer on Thursday and the news emerged on Friday. The only 'deadline' was United's flight to Chicago on Tuesday. Mbeumo should now be on it.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "Andre Onana had advised Mbeumo to choose United over Tottenham and sources confirmed he is \"so happy\" that his fellow Cameroonian is now United-bound. That sentiment is shared by the rest of the United dressing room.",
      "Cunha is a spikier character and one source at Wolves said he would \"turn on the charm\" in certain scenarios. Any squad worth its salt needs some edge and United's best player of the past 12 years has been Bruno Fernandes, one of the most truculent players in the Premier League.",
      "Cunha auditioned for United with his virtuoso matchwinning performance on Boxing Day. It wasn't a one-off. He got 15 Premier League goals last season and he was an appealing target during his first full campaign in Wolverhampton in 2023-24.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are the latest United additions who scored against them. Both are Premier League quality, albeit at clubs with expectations a fraction of United's. A cynic might question whether United can thrive with the best players bought from clubs lower down the Premier League food chain.",
      "No signing is foolproof but recruiting from the league is a significant shift from United. They cut corners as recently as last summer with Joshua Zirkzee, a Dutchman with a release clause playing in a league that has been in decline for nearly 20 years.",
      "The corner-cutting was often expensive under Erik ten Hag, whether it be reuniting him with an overpriced Ajax alumni or someone who suddenly joined his agent's stable. Granted, there were a couple of English players Ten Hag coveted (Declan Rice and Harry Kane) but his hit rate was undermined by the sheer volume of Dutch-schooled signings.",
      "Until this summer, Mason Mount was the only player United bought from a Premier League club since Harry Maguire in 2019. Whatever United's strategy, they have always made a pig's ear of it or swiftly reneged on it.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo are deals that will generate plenty of nods of approval. They strengthen the first team, offer goals, versatility and vibrancy. United have been at pains to stress they are not recruiting players for Ruben Amorim's singular 3-4-2-1 system and that is true of Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "United should feel pretty bullish when they emerge from the Stretford End tunnel against Arsenal four weeks on Sunday. Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Leny Yoro could be in their line-up. Mbeumo and Cunha are more than £130m of attacking talent going into a team that recorded an unforgivable -10 goal difference last season.",
      "There is still the glaring issue of the No.9. Amorim might be reduced to his haunches sooner than usual on the opening weekend if he sees Viktor Gyokeres with a cannon stitched onto his shirt and glances across at Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "If there is no new striker by then, Amorim has to omit Zirkzee and Hojlund from that first XI as a point of principle. The resale value argument has gone out the window with five United players already in the bomb squad and United know if they are to shift Hojlund it will almost certainly be on a season-long loan.",
      "Amorim benched Hojlund and Zirkzee as far back as February. United did not score and lost 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace. Amorim always picked a striker after that experiment.",
      "The sudden return of Zirkzee, more effective in a withdrawn role, for the Europa League final was a desperate measure and hardly a ringing endorsement for Hojlund, who fired blanks again in Bilbao before he made way. That was the 16th game United failed to score in.",
      "Mbeumo was on target four days later, in his final appearance for Brentford. Cunha was on the opposing side."

      "Ruben Amorim will oversee his first pre-season in charge of United this summer and will hope to lay the foundations for a successful campaign. Matheus Cunha will strengthen Amorim's attacking options and Bryan Mbeumo is expected to arrive soon after a third bid was accepted by Brentford.",
      "Cunha will travel to face Leeds in Stockholm, Sweden, after adapting to his new surroundings at Carrington, and United want Mbeumo to be involved during the United States tour next week.",
      "So what could the starting XI look like against Leeds? Youngsters are set to be named in the travelling squad and Amorim will likely make wholesale changes for the second half, but it makes sense to go strong from the first whistle.",
      "The players who reported for pre-season at Carrington at the earliest possible date should be slightly ahead with their fitness and Amorim will pick his starting team with that in mind.",
      "Andre Onana is currently recovering from a hamstring injury and won't be involved against Leeds, so Amorim will have a choice between Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton and Dermot Mee. Bayindir seems likely to get the nod before one of his colleagues is substituted on.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to remind everyone of his talent this season and already looks in good condition. Mainoo could start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the pivot.",
      "Amad and Joshua Zirkzee seem likely to start in attack, although the majority of Scandinavian supporters will be most excited to watch Cunha after his £62.5million transfer from Wolves. Cunha is an entertainer on the pitch and has the potential to become an immediate fan favourite.",
      "United are also set to wear their new away shirt for the first time against Leeds in Stockholm. The kit is predominantly white and light lavender with dark purple accents.",

      "After joining the club in 2002 as a seven-year-old schoolboy, the midfielder dreamt of making a name for himself at Old Trafford and following in the footsteps of countless famous names.",
      "Despite making his mark for the club's reserves, the Under-21s and signing his first professional contract under the gaze of Sir Alex Ferguson, he never got the opportunity to earn his United debut.",
      "Reluctant to sit around and wait for an opportunity that might have never come, Grimshaw, who was born and raised in nearby Burnley, joined Preston North End in January 2016, joining the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.",
      "\"You could see a few of the changes in the club that were set in motion then that might still be affecting the club today. As soon as Sir Alex left, you could tell there was a change of atmosphere in the club.",
      "\"It had gone from having a real family sort of feel. You can look back with rose-tinted glasses, can't you, but I think I was privileged enough to be there in a very special era and that was in the twilight years of that period.",
      "\"I suppose I was just privileged to be there then. I can't speak too much for what has gone on over the last ten years or so, but I think times have changed, and I was just happy to spread my wings and was realistic enough to recognise that if you have not made it by about 20, you're probably not going to.",
      "\"You have to go elsewhere and try to forge a career for yourself elsewhere.\"",
      "Grimshaw arrived at Deepdale nursing an injury that sidelined him for six months. It meant his Preston debut was delayed until the opening weekend of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "His time at the Championship club was difficult, limiting him to just eight appearances. He joined Chesterfield on loan for the second half of the 2016/17 campaign.",
      "Having left United to drop into the Championship to try and make a name for himself, Grimshaw could have easily felt a sense of disappointment at finding himself in League One just 12 months later. However, he is adamant he has no regrets about how his United career came to an end.",
      "\"I suppose at the time I got to an age where I had played plenty of reserve team football and had trained plenty enough with the first-team as well,\" he explained. \"But I got to an age when I got fed up of playing in the reserves and I wanted to go and test myself.",
      "\"You want to prove yourself in senior football and I had the opportunity to go to Motherwell on loan [in September 2015] and I took it. I took it with both hands, to be honest.",
      "\"I fancied getting out there and testing myself and I played 15 games at Motherwell while on loan and did relatively well and Preston then signed me from Man United. It would have been nice to have had an appearance for the first-team, but at the same time, I was more than realistic enough to know that those who make it into the first-team are few and far between.",
      "\"I definitely have no complaints. It would have been nice. A few of my pals who were in digs with me stayed and did get a couple of appearances, so you never know if I would have stayed. But there are certainly no regrets.\"",
      "Grimshaw, who has been without a club since leaving Dundee United in August last year, has fond memories of his time at United. He was in the company of household names throughout his time at Old Trafford, not least Ferguson.",
      "The legendary United boss, who retired at the end of the 2012/13 campaign, made a lasting impression on Grimshaw, who was often impressed by the high standards he set for everyone associated with the club.",
      "Grimshaw recalled: \"I do remember going into his office, him sitting me down and United offering me a two-year deal. It is a very special memory.",
      "\"His persona and his aura was incredible, but he was just so down to earth, really. Whenever I had any dealings with him around the club, he would always be speaking to anyone in the club like he spoke to Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "\"He would be speaking to the kit staff or the chefs like he did to his first-team players. I think that is certainly one reason why they had so much success over his time at Man United.\"",
      "After returning to Preston following his loan spell at Chesterfield in the second half of the 2016/17 season, Grimshaw, who has also flexed his muscles at right-back during his career, departed Deepdale again at the end of the 2017 summer transfer window, returning to former loan club Motherwell on a permanent basis.",
      "It was the beginning of a successful marriage between himself and the Scottish Premiership outfit. Grimshaw spent five years at Fir Park, playing more than 100 games for the club.",
      "Motherwell are one of three Scottish clubs Grimshaw has played for in his career, also representing Dundee United and Greenock Morton.",
      "\"It might sound a bit daft, but I think the Scottish game itself, and I don't know if it is now, was like how the English game was 20 or 30 years ago,\" said Grimshaw when asked why he was able to thrive in Scotland. \"It was very up and at them.",
      "\"Even though the quality might not always be there in some of the games, they are always high energy games and that suited the way I played. I just got on well with the people up there; they were very down to earth and similar sort of people to where I'm from back home.",
      "\"Motherwell was the perfect club for that. They were a very community-driven club. I have still got a lot of my pals up there now, and that is not just football players - it's people in the community as well, such as Motherwell fans.",
      "\"I just settled really quickly, and my wife and I spent the vast majority of our adult lives there after leaving Burnley when we were about 19 or 20. We were up there for the best part of ten years.",
      "\"I have nothing but good things to say about Scotland and the people. They are very friendly. I also think the Scottish game doesn't get the credit it deserves. I know a lot of folk in England poke a bit of fun.",
      "\"I think it has definitely got certain aspects that if we could bring back to the English game, it would be refreshing, certainly in the Premier League. But I think that ship has sailed now! But I only have good things to say about Scottish football.\"",
      "After leaving Dundee United in August last year, Grimshaw is yet to find himself a new club. He is now spending a lot of time travelling with his wife and young daughter.",
      "His travels give him an excuse to enjoy one of his favourite hobbies: writing. The former United youngster has a passion for putting his experiences and thoughts down on paper, and his personal blog - Thoughts from the Foothills - is his platform to do so.",
      "Outlining his passion for writing, Grimshaw said: \"I was always into my writing at school; I loved writing. I never did it outside of school, but I suppose it came quite naturally in English classes and that sort of stuff.",
      "\"I probably didn't write for ten years after school, maybe longer, to be honest, in any sort of capacity. In fact, I tell a lie, I did a couple of bits for a family in Motherwell when I was first up there when I was 19.",
      "\"My brother is a professional cricketer in the Lancashire League for Rishton and he had a really good season for Ramsbottom. They won the Worsley Cup which is a big cup for the Lancashire league and they had an incredible season.",
      "\"He scored more runs than anyone has ever scored in that cup competition in history. Michael Clarke, an Australian batter, is below him, a few West Indians, top names, and he was top of that. He got 149 in the final and I wrote a poem about it.",
      "\"I don't know why, but it was a great day, a brilliant day and hundreds of people were there. From then on, I just carried on with my writing because I enjoyed doing it and I thought 'why not, I'll keep writing'.",
      "\"I suppose I just needed somewhere to post a few of my bits, really, so I set up my website which I post on semi-regularly; I should post on it more, and I am going to try and post on it more. I suppose with travelling at the minute, I have got a bit more content themes, in terms of explaining what I'm doing. I have a bit more inspiration for my writing at the minute with being away.",
      "\"I was trying to raise some money for charity and I wrote a poem about Burnley. Burnley is my team; I'm a Burnley lad.",
      "\"I worked with a local illustrator on that and we were raising money for a local charity. It didn't do as well as I'd hoped, but I still managed to raise about £500 or £600 for two local families who had just had deaths in the family, so they were two grieving local families and we raised some money for their local charities, so that was good, and it is still available on the website now.\"",
      "Grimshaw created his blog with the idea of sharing his passion for sport, history, poetry and travel.",
      "\"Basically, it is just a platform for me to write down my thoughts on a range of things,\" he continued. \"I like writing about sport. I am very keen on history and travel.",
      "\"I have quite a passion for travel. If I am in a new city, I try to get to a sporting event or obviously try and find out about its history.",
      "\"For example, while we're in Melbourne, we are going to as many things as we can. We are going to see Rugby League and go to the races; I love my racing.",
      "\"I have a big passion for sport and history, and getting it down on paper is a hobby of mine. I have been paid to do a few articles for Nutmeg Magazine in Scotland, which is a really good football magazine. I think I have done about eight articles for them, and one of them got picked up for The Herald in Scotland.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "\"I have done a few bits and bobs, but it is definitely something I would like to try and investigate more and put a bit more time into it as well.\"",
      "Summarising his love for writing, Grimshaw concluded: \"That is exactly it. I have always enjoyed doing different things outside of football, but early on in my career, with the pressures of coming through at a place like Man United and moving on, you are always striving for the next thing and sometimes my focus would have 100 per cent been on football.",
      "\"That never wavered, don't get me wrong, but I think over time, I just learnt to use other things alongside my football. Sometimes you have to take a step away and relax and I think my writing was one of those things that helped me do it.",
      "\"Some lads would go and play golf or have a beer, but I think writing was certainly one thing for me. I would also enjoy watching live sports. It is a bit of a hobby and I have been lucky enough to have had a couple of pieces picked up off different places.",
      "\"I think I should definitely continue with it, and you never know where it might lead.\""

      "Hello and welcome back to MEN Sport's Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, July 19.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo finally looks to be on his way to Old Trafford after Brentford accepted United's latest bid with his medical expected to take place this weekend.",
      "With that deal close to being finalised, focus can shift elsewhere and it looks as though another attacking signing will be targeted. A number of top clubs are looking at strikers and that has left Ruben Amorim and Co. with limited options as Viktor Gyokeres looks to be joining Arsenal while Liverpool are in advanced discussions for Hugo Ekitike.",
      "However, Benjamin Sesko is still available and the RB Leipzig striker is certainly being considered by those at United. Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson is another option but their asking price could make any deal hard to complete.",
      "Sanctioning exits is another priority with Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all free to depart. The latter's dream move to Barcelona, while unlikely, is still possible but the latest claims have seen him linked with a move to bitter rivals Liverpool.",
      "Keep across all this and more from United in our dedicated blog below...",
      "Manchester United have seemingly wasted no time in getting to work on other new signings after reaching a transfer agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "A major priority for Ruben Amorim is to sign a midfielder following the departure of Christian Eriksen. Plenty of old and new targets have been linked and now a fresh player has seemingly emerged of interest.",
      "According to the latest reports in Italy, United have a verbal agreement with Valencia midfielder Javi Guerra. However, there are numerous conflicting claims regarding the 22-year-old with AC Milan also believed to be in the race.",
      "Click here to read the latest on Guerra's future in Spain...",
      "Some clarity on when Bryan Mbeumo's medical will take place has been provided by transfer guru Fabrizio Romano.",
      "He has stated that the main formal steps will take place today with official communication of his switch to follow shortly after that - assuming he passes the tests.",
      "United reached an agreement for his transfer on Friday afternoon with Brentford's £70million asking price met, though the fee is set to be paid across instalments.",
      "With Manchester United's stance on Benjamin Sesko clear, the RB Leipzig star is also seemingly keen on the move.",
      "According to GiveMeSport the Slovenia international 'wants' the move to United with the club 'admirers of Sesko's all-round game and believe his style would suit the Premier League'.",
      "It has also been claimed that Old Trafford would be his preferred destination over other potential suitors.",
      "Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig is one of the only strikers available on the market not being actively pursued as three Manchester United targets are set for moves elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool are in talks to sign Hugo Ekitike, Victor Osimhen is on the verge of returning to Galatasaray and Arsenal, after leaving discussions for Sesko, are closing in on a deal for Viktor Gyokeres. That has seemingly left United short of options and perhaps the decision made for them, but that is not quite the case.",
      "Spanish outlet Sport have stated that Marcus Rashford is still hoping to join Barcelona with an exit from Manchester United still the expectation.",
      "The latest update claims that Juventus, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Liverpool have all expressed interest but that the England international is not entertaining those offers.",
      "The La Liga giants are looking for a new wide forward with Nico Williams and Luis Diaz as their top targets, however it now looks as though neither will be joining which could help Rashford seal his dream move.",
      "Just in case you missed yesterday's huge news, Manchester United have finally agreed on a fee with Brentford for the transfer of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Multiple bids were turned down by the Bees before United eventually met their £70million valuation after weeks of negotiations. Personal terms were never an issue with Mbeumo set to sign a five-year contract that includes an option to extend by 12 months.",
      "His medical is scheduled to take place over the weekend. The Cameroon international is set to join Matheus Cunha as a new addition to the squad this summer.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer live blog right here on MEN Sport!",
      "For all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates, stay right here as we bringing you the latest on the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Nicolas Jackson, Emi Martinez, Benjamin Sesko and much more...",
      "According to Aksam, United are ready to approach Galatasaray for their midfielder Gabriel Sara this summer.",
      "The Brazilian moved to Turkey from Norwich City last summer and scored two goals and bagged nine assists in 31 league appearances for the Istanbul club.",
      "It is believed the Reds are willing to bid £26m for the 26-year-old whereas Galatasaray are thought to be unwilling to sell and would only consider offers starting at £30.3m.",
      "Sara has mainly played in central midfield but does have experience as an attacking and defensive midfielder.",
      "Mbeumo's arrival has not yet been officially confirmed but it is certainly on the way.",
      "One new player who is in the building though is Diego Leon.",
      "The full-back has been handed the No.30 for the forthcoming season which suggests he will be a fringe player in the United first team squad rather than solely being an academy player.",
      "This shirt has often been given to fringe players with notable owners including John O'Shea and Matteo Darmian.",
      "It was last worn by reserve goalkeeper Nathan Bishop.",
      "According to South American journalist Joao Van Boysen, former United winger Facundo Pellistri is attracting interest from Fluminense in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Brazilians who starred at the Club World Cup are preparing for Jhon Arias to leave the club and have identified the Uruguayan as a possible target.",
      "Pellistri had an unspectacular start to life with Panathinaikos but if he were to be sold, United would benefit from a 45 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "The Reds sold him for just £5.1m and United will only gain a percentage of his sale from any profit that the Greek club make.",
      "As mentioned earlier, The Athletic are reporting that Mbeumo's medical is set for this weekend.",
      "United will be hopeful that the medical will pass without a hitch and that an official announcement for the forward can be made early next week.",
      "Mbeumo has been United's priority since June but negotiations have been long, and at times, excruciating.",
      "United have decided not to include Harry Amass in their squad for the pre-season fixture against Leeds tomorrow.",
      "Instead, the decision has been made to send him out on loan this summer to gain minutes.",
      "There is believed to be a lot of interest in the young full-back.",
      "Meanwhile, Diego Leon is on the plane to Stockholm.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "After receiving his new number today, United have decided the plan for the full-back this season and beyond.",

Matheus Cunha joined the club from Wolves last month, before Diego Leon arrived from Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno earlier this month.",
      "Pre-season is the perfect time for any head coach to experiment and test the water, and Amorim is expected to do exactly that over the next few weeks. There is a strong chance he could field two completely different XIs in either half against Leeds.",
      "With Andre Onana unavailable because of a hamstring injury, the door has opened for Altay Bayindir to start United's pre-season opener.",
      "If Amorim intends on deploying his strongest possible XI from the start against Leeds, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven will be pushing for starting berths. Other centre-back options include the likes of Harry Maguire, Tyler Fredricson and Godwill Kukonki.",
      "As far as the wing-backs are concerned, Amad and Luke Shaw returned to Carrington a few days before Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu, who were both on international duty at the end of last season, meaning they could start. Harry Amass has not travelled to Sweden amid the expectation he will head out on loan.",
      "Despite United's interest in signing a midfielder this summer, it is difficult to call who could start in the engine room.",
      "Toby Collyer was back at Carrington on the first day of pre-season, meaning that could see him bag a start. Bruno Fernandes, as captain, may also be in line for a start.",
      "All eyes will be on Cunha and he is highly likely to get his first outing in United colours from the start as the left-sided No.10. Mason Mount could take the other playmaker role.",
      "United are still searching for a striker, meaning Rasmus Hojlund could be tasked with leading the line for the pre-season opener. Chido Obi will also be eyeing some minutes.",
      "United predicted XI vs Leeds United: Bayindir; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Collyer, Fernandes, Shaw; Mount, Cunha; Hojlund.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Manchester United may be set to miss out on Victor Osimhen this summer but reports in Italy suggest there is a clause in his next transfer that could help the Reds in the future.",
      "The transfer saga surrounding the future of Osimhen has dominated the past two summer windows after his relationship with Napoli broke down. In 2024, the Nigerian centre-forward made it clear that he wished to leave the Naples club to explore other options.",
      "While Chelsea showed a keen interest, Napoli were unwilling to agree terms with the Premier League club and were trying to negotiate a move to the Saudi Pro League. Osimhen did not see that move as beneficial for his career and he instead chose to stay in Italy.",
      "With options quickly disappearing, Osimhen agreed a loan move to Galatasaray who benefitted from their summer window closing later than most of Europe. This proved to be a wise choice as the 26-year-old took Turkey by storm scoring 37 goals.",
      "Upon his return to Italy, Osimhen received strong enquiries and approaches from Al Hilal but again he refused to move to Saudi Arabia. Having enjoyed his loan spell at Galatasaray, it now appears that the Turkish club are willing to make his stay permanent and the forward has agreed to this.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Galatasaray have agreed to pay Napoli £34.7m up front and then a further £30.4m by 2026. However, a clause in his contract could help United complete a deal for Osimhen in the near future.",
      "It is claimed there is an agreement billed as an 'anti-Italy' clause which prevents Galatasaray from selling their star striker to another Italian team until 2027. Should they break this clause, the Istanbul club would likely have to double the price of the deal to a Serie A team to make it worth their while.",
      "Such a clause is only going to be beneficial for United in the coming summers if they want to sign Osimhen as the less teams that can feasibly bid for the player, the better. There is a feeling that the 26-year-old may see Galatasaray as another stopgap before moving to a bigger club.",
      "However, his passion for Galatasaray right now means his immediate future is going to be in Turkey and not the Premier League."

      "The attacker, who was directly involved in 28 Premier League goals last season, will bring plenty of versatility to Old Trafford. As well as being an option at right-wing and for the right-sided No.10 role, he is also capable of playing through the centre of the attack.",

      "United last visited the Strawberry Arena when they beat Ajax 2-0 in the 2017 Europa League final. Goals either side of half-time from Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan got the job done for United, who secured their third and final trophy of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "After winning the League Cup a few months earlier, the victory over Ajax ensured United enjoyed a successful first season under Mourinho. They also kicked off the campaign by winning the Community Shield at Wembley.",

      "After starting all but three of United's matches en route to the final, Romero was given the nod ahead of David de Gea to start against Ajax. The 2-0 triumph marked eighth clean sheet of the season in the competition. He left Old Trafford in 2021 and now plays for Argentine giants Boca Juniors, whom he has been with since 2022.",
      "One of the most popular players to have donned a United shirt in recent years, Valencia spent ten successful years at Old Trafford, winning nine major trophies. Valencia, who donned the captain's armband against Ajax, left United in 2019 and announced his retirement from professional football in 2021 at the age of 35.",
      "Signed from Fulham by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2010, Smalling spent a decade at Old Trafford before moving to Roma, initially on loan, in 2020. His United career saw him win eight trophies, with the 2017 Europa League triumph being his last. The 35-year-old, following four years at Roma, now plays for Saudi Arabian side Al-Fayha.",
      "Signed by Louis van Gaal in 2014, Blind was a often versatile operator for United, capable of playing at centre-back, left-back and in midfield. He spent four years at Old Trafford, winning four major trophies, before returning to Ajax in 2018. The 35-year-old, who started the 2017 Europa League final at left-back, now plays for Spanish club Girona.",

      "Signed from Chelsea in 2014, Mata spent eight years at United, winning four major trophies. The Spaniard departed at the end of the 2021/22 season, leaving on a free transfer, and joined Galatasaray. Via a spell in Japan, the 37-year-old now plays in Australia for Western Sydney Wanderers.",
      "Herrera spent four years at United after being signed from Spanish club Athletic Club in 2015. The midfielder, who will turn 36 next month, departed in 2019 and joined Paris Saint-Germain on a long-term contract. After three years in Paris, he returned to Athletic Club before joining Boca Juniors in January this year.",
      "Like Valencia, Fellaini has also hung up his boots, retiring in February last year. The Belgian, who was brought to Old Trafford by David Moyes in 2013, spent six years at the club, winning four major trophies. He also chipped in with 22 goals. After leaving United in 2019, he spent four seasons at Chinese club Shandong Taishan.",
      "Brought back to Old Trafford by Mourinho the previous summer, Pogba made his mark on the 2017 Europa League final by scoring the opening goal. His second stint at United saw him win two major honours, both of which were clinched in the 2016/17 campaign. He left the club at the end of the 2021/22 campaign and later returned to Juventus. He recently secured a route back into football, joining AS Monaco, after serving a lengthy doping ban.",
      "Mkhitaryan scored United's second goal against Ajax, ensuring they secured their maiden Europa League crown. Signed from Borussia Dortmund in July 2016, the attacker spent one-and-a-half years at Old Trafford before moving to Arsenal in January 2018. He won three major trophies during his time at United. He spent two years at Arsenal before moving to Italy and joining Roma. He has been at Inter since 2022.",
      "Rashford is the only player that started the 2017 Europa League final that is still at United - but that might not be the case for much longer. The forward, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, wants to leave the club this summer and United want to sell him. Rashford scored two goals in United's 2016/17 Europa League-winning campaign."

      "United have submitted a third bid for the Cameroonian international, understood to be worth up to £70million. They have offered £65m up front and an additional £5m in add-ons.",
      "United have been locked in talks with Brentford for just over six weeks, meaning they will now be hoping it will be third time lucky in their quest to lure him to Old Trafford. Mbeumo made it crystal clear several weeks ago that he wants to move to M16.",
      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals last season, Mbeumo would be a second statement signing of the summer for United. They have already splashed out £62.5m on bringing Matheus Cunha, who scored 17 goals last term, to the club from Wolves.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in head coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and there is a strong chance Mbeumo could be installed as the right-sided playmaker. His versatility, though, means he could be deployed elsewhere.",
      "Primarily a winger throughout his time at Brentford, Mbeumo is renowned for cutting in from the right and making full use of his trustworthy left foot. It means he could be an option as either the right-sided No.10 or right wing-back for Amorim.",
      "Amad, who regularly blossomed for United last term, is also equally capable as a right-sided No.10 or right wing-back. With that said, the worst that can happen is that Amad and Mbeumo create healthy competition for each other and a selection dilemma for Amorim.",
      "With Cunha a guaranteed starter and Mbeumo expected to be given the same treatment if he finalises a switch to M16 without any further setbacks, Amorim's first-choice starting XI for the 2025/26 will be closer towards completion.",
      "As things currently stand, United are still in the market for a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper, meaning they will soon have to flex their muscles in the seller's market to fund those prospective additions.",
      "Despite currently being unavailable because of a hamstring injury, Andre Onana is expected to remain United's first-choice goalkeeper this season. United want to recruit a shot-stopper who can compete with and push the Cameroonian, but Onana is under the impression he will remain Amorim's No.1.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back and pre-season performances could dictate who starts the season opener against Arsenal in a month's time. Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are the future of United's backline and will believe they are worthy of becoming staples in the wide centre-back roles, while Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire will be fighting to start in the middle.",
      "On the presumption Mbeumo is deployed in attack, Amad is the logical pick at right wing-back after regularly catching the eye on the right flank last season. Meanwhile, Patrick Dorgu is a shoo-in on the opposite flank and will be keen to improve after arriving from Lecce earlier this year.",
      "Following Cunha's arrival, Bruno Fernandes is expected to complete a permanent switch to midfield and occupy one of the two No.8 spots. He regularly operated from the engine room in the second half of last term and rarely looked out of place.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer and Casemiro are all currently jockeying to join Fernandes in midfield, but the club remains keen on signing a new midfielder. Who that could be is currently impossible to predict.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha will build two thirds of Amorim's attack, occupying the two No.10 spots. The United chief struggled in his search for consistency in those two roles last season, meaning it is highly likely those positions could be occupied by new faces.",
      "United's need for an out-and-out centre-forward has been well-documented throughout the summer, and they attempted to solve that particular mission quickly by swooping for Liam Delap last month. However, Chelsea pipped them to his signature.",
      "The Reds have since been heavily linked with the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen but are increasingly likely to miss out on both of them. Fortunately, the prospect of adding Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha should ease the attacking burden on whoever leads United's attack come the start of the season.",
      "United's dream XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, new midfielder, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; new striker.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit."

      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly declined an invitation from Sir Jim Ratcliffe to accompany the Manchester United leadership team on a trip to Iceland, choosing instead to concentrate fully on pre-season preparations. As he gears up for his first full season in charge, the Portuguese head coach recognises the need to make every moment count.",
      "As United look to break free from mediocrity next season, Ratcliffe continues to conduct business in his preferred manner. The Athletic reports that the co-owner of the Reds invited chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox on a fishing trip to Iceland this week.",
      "Ratcliffe, an experienced traveller, often meets with senior Ineos executives globally, reportedly seeing these gatherings as a chance to discuss business in a relaxed setting.",
      "Ratcliffe, Berrada, and Wilcox are reportedly spending the 48 hours before Saturday's first pre-season match against Leeds United in Stockholm.",
      "While fishing, one of Ratcliffe's favourite pastimes, was undoubtedly part of the plan, discussions about sporting and commercial issues at Old Trafford were also likely on the agenda, reports the Express.",
      "Given Ratcliffe's preference for making significant decisions face-to-face, it's probable that United's third offer for Bryan Mbeumo was conceived on the Nordic island.",
      "The report further states that Amorim was not present at the meeting, despite Ratcliffe's suggestion that he join the trio for in-depth discussions away from the hustle and bustle of M16.",
      "It is reported that, following these talks, the Ineos mogul respected Amorim's wish to remain with his team in preparation for their match against Leeds in Stockholm on Saturday.",
      "Amorim will conduct a training session at Carrington on Friday morning before flying to Stockholm later in the day with his staff and players.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox are scheduled to travel to the Swedish capital on Saturday morning once their Icelandic meeting with Ratcliffe concludes.",
      "Following the Leeds match, West Ham United, Bournemouth and Everton await in the United States as part of the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "United will visit New Jersey, Chicago and Atlanta between July 27 and August 8 before returning to Manchester to conclude their pre-season schedule against Fiorentina. The club hopes that Mbeumo will finalise his move from Brentford before they depart for the US on Tuesday.",
      "Brentford have yet to respond to United's offer, which is worth £65million plus an additional £5m in add-ons, but there is confidence that they will accept it."

      "Manchester United's pre-season work steps up a notch on Saturday afternoon when the Reds take on Leeds in Stockholm for their first warm-up fixture of the summer.",
      "United had hoped their squad would look markedly different against the Whites with a number of new faces but that has not proven to be the case. Matheus Cunha could make his first appearance for the Reds but other new first-team additions have been few and far between.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo could be on the way soon should Brentford accept United's £70m offer for the Cameroonian. MEN Sport understands there is confidence in the Reds' camp that the Bees will react positively to the bid.",
      "In an interview with the German publication BILD, former United manager and current Bayer Leverkusen boss Erik ten Hag was asked about the possibility of him signing Antony this summer. His response left the door ajar for the Brazilian.",
      "\"He has great quality,\" the Dutchman said. \"I signed him twice.",
      "\"He was like a son to me, he still is a son to me. We're not interested in him at the moment, but we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Moving to Bayer Leverkusen would be a brilliant move for not just Antony but United too. Currently, the winger's heart is set on returning to Real Betis, which is fine, but they do not seem capable of paying the sort of figure that United are demanding. If Leverkusen were to enter the race, there is a likelihood that they would be able to match United's asking price. The Reds cannot afford to allow every player to go on the cheap just to get them off the books so there would definitely be a few in the recruitment team hoping the Bundesliga club change their mind.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko would be interested in signing for United should they come in for him this summer. The Slovenian entered talks with Arsenal earlier in the window but it now seems the Gunners' priorities are elsewhere.",
      "As for Sesko, who is valued at £78m, he is reportedly willing to give United priority even though they cannot offer him Champions League football.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is clear that Ruben Amorim would prefer to sign Viktor Gyokeres in an ideal world this summer. However, that ship looks to have sailed and the attention must now switch to other targets. Sesko would be an impressive second choice. He has a very similar profile to Gyokeres - he is quick, strong and has an eye for goal. What potentially makes him an even better option than the Swede is his age. He is five years younger than Gyokeres which makes him a more enticing prospect for Ineos who favour signings with potential resale value. It will be interesting to see if this progresses further."

      "Marcus Rashford should be the most sellable member of the five-man Manchester United bomb squad. But he’s not…",
      "When they entered the summer, United were apparently hopeful of raking in around £160million for the five players everyone knows they want rid of.",
      "That, obviously, was ludicrous. The only club daft enough to pay top whack for these lads would be United themselves.",
      "So as the summer rolls on, United remain at an impasse with the transfers, unable to strengthen much further before they get rid of their drifters.",
      "How much can they hope to bank now? Is it possible they will start the season with all five still on their books? Here’s how we rank the unwanted stars based on how likely they are to earn some money for United…",
      "",
      "5) Tyrell Malacia\nPSV opted against taking up their option to sign Malacia for £9million because they’re not daft. The Netherlands defender started only three Eredivisie games after joining in January but at least he proved to any potential suitors that he’s not completely broken having spent over a year on the sidelines.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t aid United in their mission to sell Malacia when he revealed the 25-year-old hasn’t got it in him to play as a wing-back because he struggles to go forward. Which feels like something United ought to have spotted earlier but, as we know, they haven’t been the most observant bunch.",
      "So what now? United will apparently accept something like £3million just so Malacia doesn’t show as a loss on the books. Will anyone who can afford his £75,000-a-week salary stump up? Probably not.",
      "",
      "4) Jadon Sancho \nUnited need to hope there is some truth in reports Juventus want both Sancho and Francisco Conceicao since it seems the Old Lady has done a deal to sign the Portuguese winger from Porto.",
      "Regardless, whether it’s Juve or anyone else, United will have to accept they aren’t going to get anything like the £25million they hoped for. Frankly, they’ll be fortunate to bank anything while escorting Sancho off the premises one last time.",
      "The winger is on something ridiculous like £250,000 a week which he is due for another year. Chelsea offered him the chance to get away for less, but that wasn’t for him. Juve certainly won’t pay the same salary – reports suggest he’s being offered half. And we doubt Sancho is motivated enough to give up half of what he’s contractually owed to take up a great opportunity in Turin.",
      "And, to be fair, why should he? It makes sense for Sancho to sit tight, wait for a loan move at the end of the window, when United will have to accept paying only a portion of his salary for the reward of having him out the door. Then, in a year, after another season trousering an undeserved wedge, he gets to go as a free agent.",
      "So, if anyone is daft enough to offer actual money for Sancho, United ought to snap their hand off.",
      "",
      "3) Antony\nAside from Malacia, around whom all is deathly quiet, the least noise among the bomb squad is coming from Antony’s direction. Because it was thought Real Betis would find a way to bring back a winger who regained some credibility while on loan in Spain during the second half of last season.",
      "Can Betis afford to buy? Maybe, probably not. And they are cool with that being known. Because it will squeeze United ever more over a player who clearly has no future under Amorim.",
      "Of course, Betis would prefer Antony back on loan but United insist they won’t do that. At least not without guarantees and the Spaniards are toying with some workarounds. There are reports of interest from elsewhere but nothing firm enough for Betis to panic into making United an offer they might be satisfied to accept. Certainly not yet. And they are content in the knowledge Antony fancies being back in Andalusia.",
      "Apparently, United have already dropped the asking price from £40million to £30million, but they won’t get that either. Certainly not in the form of cold hard cash they can put towards their stalled summer recruitment.",
      "🔴⚪⚫ MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n👉 Amorim sacked for Xavi as Postecoglou returns: Predicting nine Premier League successors\n👉 Only West Ham more miserable than Man Utd in Premier League mood rankings",
      "",
      "2) Marcus Rashford\nRashford is probably United’s most sellable asset of the five. But that also means he can afford to be pickier when choosing his next move.",
      "Ideally, he would go to Barcelona. A few weeks ago, that appeared something of a pipe dream while Nico Williams was being teased by the Catalans. But Barca’s failure to close a deal for Williams highlights the financial constraints they remain under.",
      "If they can’t buy Williams, they probably can’t buy Rashford. But they can wait until the back end of the window before offering a loan deal with options or obligations, which at least gets the forward’s salary – or most of it – off United’s books.",
      "Barca can bide their time here because they know Rashford’s desire. Without something coming from nothing, the only obvious threat we see here is Bayern Munich, given the Bavarians and Liverpool are way, way off in their valuations of Luis Diaz. And even then, Leandro Trossard could be a cheaper option.",
      "",
      "1) Alejandro Garnacho\nThe Argentina winger probably represents United’s best chance of banking some cash. But certainly not the £70million they initially hoped for. Nor £60million after their first reduction. If they get anything more than half the price they were initially quoting, that’s a result.",
      "Why should they be grateful for that? Because Garnacho would be a risk for anyone taking on the his full rights this summer.",
      "As a player, we know he is limited. He has bursts, moments. For a winger, he’s not rapid and as a right-footer on the left, he struggles to go down the outside.",
      "If that doesn’t make buyers beware, his character ought to. There were red flags around Garnacho’s attitude even before he made his first senior start and all the evidence suggests little has changed.",
      "So the smart suitors will insist on trying before they buy, but someone of the not-unreasonable belief that United is more the problem, not the player, could be tempted by Garnacho. Probably Chelsea.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly reserved some money to buy Gabriel Sara from Galatasaray this summer, while there is an update on Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man Utd have agreed a £71m fee with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo but once Sir Jim Ratcliffe remembers he ‘won’t be held ransom’ they will need to find an alternative.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly suggested that Barcelona could use one player if they wanted to reduce their asking price for Marcus Rashford.",
      "Juventus are also interested in bringing Marcus Rashford to Serie A this summer after edging closer to a deal for Jadon Sancho, according to reports.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been left out of Man Utd’s pre-season plans as three Premier League clubs consider a summer transfer.",
      "Man Utd have ‘turned their attention’ to a potential Chelsea swap as Sir Jim Ratcliffe refuses to be ‘pushed’ into a deal for Mbeumo."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, and they are on course to do so…",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Como – £87.9m\nThe richest club in Serie A are determined to spend money to secure European football for next season. Jesus Rodriguez is the most expensive of those to arrive so far.",
      "",
      "9) Bayer Leverkusen – £88m\nArmed with money from Liverpool for Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, new coach Erik ten Hag has been busy, with US international Malik Tillman coming in for a club-record fee.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Atletico Madrid – £92.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada and Matteo Ruggeri have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again.",
      "",
      "7) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £122.1m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £127m\nThere is agitation at Arsenal that a nine-figure spend is yet to deliver a shiny new centre-forward but if Viktor Gyokeres does eventually arrive it is likely to be a £200m summer to spark the start of Mikel Arteta’s next phase.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "26) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "25) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "24) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "23) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "22) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "21) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "20) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "19) Noni Madueke – £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "18) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "15) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "A new report has revealed the ‘most realistic solution’ for Manchester City and England star Jack Grealish amid interest from Premier League rivals.",
      "Jack Grealish looks destined to leave Man City this summer but a £300k-a-week wage has made it hard for clubs to take the risk.",
      "Mohammed Kudus and Morgan Gibbs-White are desperate to take a step down to complete dream Spurs moves, few players having ever done so at greater expense.",
      "Newcastle United are reportedly interested in signing two England internationals, including Manchester City winger Jack Grealish.",
      "Daniel Levy probably needs to stop offering transfer add-ons based on ‘difficult objectives’ like Spurs winning the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "Every Cruyff turn is a footprint. Some players leave lasting impressions; others barely register. Was peak Eden Hazard the very best?"

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIt seems as though Liverpool have taken Newcastle seriously when they were told that Isak isn’t for sale. And the intent the Reds are showing around Ekitike instead douses our suspicion that Dicky Hughes wasn’t done with Isak.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nMilan are looking into the feasibility of signing Hojlund as they search for a striker. United paid Atalanta £72million two years ago and the Rossoneri would struggle to give the Red Devils half of their money back. And even if Hojlund has struggled, from a numbers perspective, United simply cannot afford to shed any strikers since Hojlund is the only senior specialist centre-forward they currently have.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Juventus\nSky in Italy reckon Juve have ‘begun to explore the conditions’ around a deal to sign Rashford. Which is presumably when they discover they can’t afford him without one or two parties making serious concessions. Like Barcelona, the Old Lady would have to wait until United get desperate and start considering loans.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt seems Juve have finally agreed a deal with Porto for Francisco Conceicao which, presumably, will supress the Old Lady’s appetite for Sancho. And with the talk of Juve interest in Rashford, what now for Sancho?",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Aston Villa\nJackson was rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United but Unai Emery is said to be keen to be reunited with the striker with whom he worked at Villarreal. Villa’s interest in Jackson is heavily linked to…",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Chelsea\nRogers is said to be Chelsea priority for the remainder of the window and while Villa are reluctant to sell, any big offer would have to be considered. If Rogers is to join Chelsea, likely triggering a Villa move for Jackson, it won’t be long before the end of the window.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko is back in the 20 after losing out to Gyokeres in Arsenal audition but, apparently, United are ‘serious’ about signing the Slovenian. Maybe they are, and Christ knows they need a striker, but they will have to start selling sharpish if they are to afford what Leipzig are demanding.",

      "",
      "13) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s got to go somewhere.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "10) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Yoanne Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle seem to have switched their sights from Ekitike to Wissa. But there could be more bad news for the Mags. Man Utd seem to have finally got their mitts on Bryan Mbeumo, which makes it less likely the Bees will entertain interest in Wissa too.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too.",
      "",
      "7) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement. Lord knows they’ve been discussing it for long enough.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool\nNewcastle saw the writing on the wall and backed away quietly, leaving Liverpool to argue the toss with Eintracht. Their first offer worth £70million was rejected and, to be fair to the Germans, the suggestion has always been that they want £85million. And since Liverpool were prepared to go way above that for Isak, Eintracht will try to squeeze Liverpool for all they are worth, even if Ekitike is keen to move to Anfield.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion. Gyokeres’ representatives were apparently in London at the start of the week, and removal vans have been seen shifting furniture from his home in Portugal. If Arteta wants the striker on the plane for the pre-season tour, this needs to progress significantly in the next 24 hours.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nWe have a deal! United have spent weeks haggling, only to pay more than Brentford’s initial asking price. But a medical is set to take place over the weekend before Mbeumo flies off to the United States with his new team-mates. Now for a striker. And some sales.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger will be unveiled by Arsenal any time now after a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "15-year season tickets, 40% of the capacity going to the corporates and an ‘American-style matchday experiences’ are all part of the new stadium proposals Man Utd have put to their fans.",
      "In March, the club announced plans to build a new stadium which will see the current Old Trafford knocked down. Now, with a date of 2030 set for opening, the club has asked for their fans’ verdicts on a number of measures that could come into effect when the new stadium is up and running.",
      "As revealed by Cheeses Of Nazareth, a Twitter account focused on United ticket details, the club reached out to supporters to take part in discussions about proposals for the new stadium.",
      "Although attendance was reportedly low, the club did set out a number of discussion points.",
      "First up, there was the idea of a long-term season ticket contract which involves paying a large upfront fee to secure your seat for 15 years or more. Purchasing this would also secure your seat from being reallocated should the club decide that was needed.",
      "Another proposal was that 40% of the 100,000-seater stadium would be for hospitality, including ‘premium viewing areas’ on the halfway line.",
      "Speaking of premium, that was a suggestion for a new model of season ticket which would give fans better chances of securing away tickets, access to concerts at the ground and premium stadium areas.",
      "But perhaps the suggestion that would most go against a typical English view of football is the ‘American-style Matchday Experience.’ This would see the concourse extended to include 360-degree screen bars, multiple smaller merchandise outlets instead of a single large megastore and the ability to move around the concourse with your ticket.",
      "This idea is not unique to United with clubs like Tottenham already having such a system in place.",
      "At the time of the stadium’s announcement, co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted it to be not just the “the world’s greatest football stadium” but also “the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area.”",
      "“Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world’s greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford,” Ratcliffe said.",
      "“Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport. By building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience, only footsteps from our historic home.",
      "“Just as important is the opportunity for a new stadium to be the catalyst for social and economic renewal of the Old Trafford area, creating jobs and investment, not just during the construction phase, but on a lasting basis when the stadium district is complete.",
      "“The Government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance.”",

      "‘Not everybody at United agrees with the decision to limit their access to evening hours, however, given the relationships they have with people at the club.

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Djordje Petrovic – £22m/€28.8m (Chelsea to Bournemouth, July 2025)\nThe Chelsea transfer ethos in action: a player they signed for £12m on a seven-year contract and who played as many games for the Blues as Strasbourg was sold for almost twice as much within two years.",
      "",
      "18) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "19) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "20) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",

If Rashford gives the green light to playing in Turkey, Fenerbahçe will knock on Manchester United’s door with an official offer.",

However, no club has yet been able to meet the player’s financial demands. If the offers he wants from Europe’s top leagues don’t come through, Rashford might consider Turkey. In that case, Fenerbahçe would take the lead in this transfer.’",

      "It is exceptional work as ever from the recruitment team, who might soon get cold feet and need to look at some alternatives.",
      "We took a look at FBRef for options across Europe’s top five leagues that have very similar characteristics to Mbeumo, which amusingly features one current Manchester United player they’re desperate to be rid of and one a club has just made a £40m profit on after signing him from United two years ago.",
      "",
      "Alex Berenguer (Athletic Club)\nProbably not the Athletic Club forward the fans would be dreaming of signing this summer, but if Barcelona and Arsenal can’t persuade Nico Williams to join them there’s not much hope for United. And they in turn are in absolutely no position to be sniffy about a 30-year-old winger who got more league goal contributions (14) last season than any of their players aside from Bruno Fernandes (18).",
      "",
      "Mattia Zaccagni (Lazio)\nThere’s interest from Nottingham Forest in the Lazio captain as they prepare for inevitable defeat to Tottenham in the not-so-secret Morgan Gibbs-White release clause saga, and without the funds to build a squad which aligns with the fanciful INEOS strategy of developing young talent with significant sell-on value, moves for relatively inexpensive but experienced footballers like Zaccagni make a lot of sense. It’s a ploy that’s worked famously for Inter Milan.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nHe’s a player we’re sure United would have been making a move for had they qualified for the Champions League – he would be ideal in the 3-4-3. As it stands, their Europa League vanquishers Tottenham are interested, as are Bayern Munich. Probably Bayern Munich then.",
      "",
      "Anthony Gordon (Newcastle)\nThe supposed similarity between Gordon and their primary target should perhaps raise United alarms as to the suitability of Mbeumo to the inverted winger role as Gordon is a proper winger’s winger – paint on the soles of his boots and all that.",
      "That said, we’re pretty sure Amorim wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to sign Gordon should he miraculously become an option.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi (Everton)\nHe was low-key excellent last season, with his nine Premier League goals and six assists comfortably beating his best previous return of 11 goal contributions in 2018/2019 for Arsenal. Primed for a £20m late-window bid before Fulham ask for an added £20m in United tax.",
      "",
      "Inaki Williams (Athletic Club)\nCan’t be easy living in his brother’s shadow, though we’re guessing the £220,000 Inaki gets a week to play football eases the pain somewhat. He’s not about to leave a club in the Champions League and even United won’t fork out those wages.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nJust brilliant. Not just because United are doing everything in their power to get him out of the club but also because he was deemed unsuited to Amorim’s system in the short time he was playing for him.",
      "And yes, we get the argument that Amorim has shown strength of character in showing ‘bad apples’ the door no matter their talent, but there won’t be a Red Devils fan out there not wondering – even briefly – whether a softer approach may have led to Rashford thriving at his boyhood club rather than at Aston Villa in the second half of last season and wherever he finds himself next term while United pay half his wages.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga (Newcastle)\nWe’re 99 per cent sure United would have rivalled Newcastle for Elanga’s £55m signing this summer had it not required an embarrassing climbdown after they sold him to Nottingham Forest for £15m two years ago.",
      "A report emerged after his stunning goal against United in April that while ‘there was an appreciation at the club for his phenomenal physical talents’, the club let him go due to ‘reservations over how he would parlay those skills into breaking down stubborn defences’.",
      "United do not now hold what we would suggest would have been the very same ‘reservations’ back then over a move for Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "Justin Kluivert (Bournemouth)\nHe’s someone we could genuinely see United genuinely pivoting to if they miss out on Mbeumo. A 26-year-old who’s perfect for one of those roles behind the central striker, coming off the back of a standout season playing for a club not in European competition with no more than an outside chance of achieving that feat in the coming campaign. A prime candidate.",
      "",
      "Cody Gakpo (Liverpool)\nBayern are supposedly keen and we’re currently at a point where we wouldn’t be particularly surprised by any forward either leaving or joining Liverpool. We would be surprised if any of them joined Manchester United.",

      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the Red Devils set to pay £71m, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd have been hard at work in negotiations for Mbeumo but the deal has been stuck for weeks after the Red Devils had two bids rejected for the Cameroon international.",
      "A report on Wednesday in The Guardian claimed that things had stalled after Brentford ‘raised their valuation to closer to £70m, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe intent on not being pushed into paying more than his club’s £65m valuation of the forward’.",

      "Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg added: ‘Bryan #Mbeumo to Manchester United is considered a done deal! A total agreement with Brentford has now been reached. #MUFC will pay around €75m million guaranteed plus add-ons, as first via @TheAthletic and confirmed. Medical soon.’",

Green light from Brentford and club to club agreement reached for £70m package, as @TheAthleticFC reports. Contract agreed weeks ago with Mbeumo as he only wanted Man United move. After Cunha, Mbeumo next for #MUFC.’",

Other clubs know United’s position. They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers.",

The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it.",

    "body": [
      "Aston Villa did a Chelsea by selling their women’s team to themselves to avoid a PSR breach and remove the need for unwanted player trading before June 30.",
      "But Villa’s ambitions on the pitch and in the transfer market mean they will likely need to stomach at least one high-profile departure this summer to create enough wiggle room in the current transfer window and beyond, with the amortisation of player registration costs meaning it pays to sell players and sign new ones.",
      "A stupid rule but one we’re all stuck with for now. Anyway, we’ve ranked Villa’s top ten most valuable players according to Transfermarkt by the likelihood of them being sold this summer, and have even reassigned them to willing beneficiaries.",
      "",
      "10) Boubacar Kamara (£36m) – Manchester United\nLoved by Villa fans and underrated by the rest, they’re so, so much better when Kamara’s in the team. He’s worth more to Villa than just about any Premier League side other than United, who haven’t officially admitted to Manuel Ugarte being a stunning waste of £42m but essentially have by accepting that Casemiro in central midfield incredibly remains their reality for next season.",
      "",
      "9) Ezri Konsa (£30m) – Manchester City\nWe really like Konsa and think he’s got as good a chance as anyone of starting the World Cup for England in Thomas Tuchel’s starting XI, though that perhaps sounds like higher praise than it actually is given the dearth of quality in that particular area of the pitch for the Three Lions.",
      "Anyway, he’s great and Villa shouldn’t sell him.",
      "But no-one’s untouchable in their circumstances and we’ve got a strong suspicion that City are walking into a season with a dodgy mix of young and injury-prone centre-backs.",
      "Neither Abdukodir Khusanov nor Vitor Reis convinced after arriving in January, and while the former showed signs he could develop into a quality defender, he may not be granted the luxury of easing into Premier League football when all of Manuel Akanji, John Stones and Nathan Ake are nailed on to be out of action for at least half a season.",
      "And even without widespread injury problems, we reckon Konsa would stand a very good chance of being first choice should he make the switch to the Etihad.",
      "",
      "8) Youri Tielemans (£33m) – Real Madrid\nWith Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni as his defensive midfield options, “Xabi is missing his ‘Xabi’,” sources close to the Real Madrid coach told ESPN. A’ deep-lying midfielder who can serve not only as a defensive asset but also a playmaking monster’ is essentially a description of Tielemans, who was linked with a move to the Bernabeu towards the end of his Leicester days.",
      "Villa will be loathe to lose him and we are just as uncomfortable at the thought of him not gliding across Premier League pitches next season.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Torres (£28m) – Real Madrid\nAlonso’s other Madrid priority is a new centre-back as David Alaba and Eder Militao continue to struggle with injuries while Antonio Rudiger looked at the Club World Cup as though age and years of sh*thousery are catching up with him.",
      "That leaves Alonso with young pair Dean Huijsen and Raúl Asencio, and after Torres very nearly moved to the Bernabeu in 2021, reports in April claimed Madrid were again keeping tabs on the 28-year-old.",
      "Our guess is Torres would be somewhere near the bottom of this ranking if it were up to Emery, who counted on the Spain international at Villarreal before signing him for Villa. But a decent offer for a player whose value is only going in one direction should be welcomed.",
      "",
      "6) Ian Maatsen (£24m) – Borussia Dortmund\nHis was far from the most suspicious PSR-swerving deal last summer. About four weeks before his move to the Midlands, Maatsen started the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund and was named in that season’s team of the tournament. As an isolated deal, there could be no complaints.",
      "But we all smelled a rat given his deal was tied inextricably to Omari Kellyman’s opposite move to Chelsea.",
      "Just ten Premier League starts and a season of playing second fiddle to Lucas Digne provided decent further evidence of the transfer not being one Emery was calling out for last summer, which suggests he would be very much open to Maatsen once again being used as a pawn in this grim game of FFP chess they’re playing with whoever’s amenable.",
      "Short of a PSR pal both willing to sign Maatsen and able to attract him, a return to Dortmund it is.",
      "",
      "5) Amadou Onana (£43m) – Tottenham\nA bit of a shock for him to be Villa’s second-most valuable asset but that’s as much to do with him being 23 as it is his footballing quality, which is only good enough for the bench in Emery’s first-choice XI, with Kamara and Tielemans the undoubted best partnership at the base of midfield.",
      "That surely makes Onana a standout candidate to be shipped out, and without an obvious team outside of the Premier League willing to pay the usual premium for an as yet unproven midfielder at the very highest level, the Arsenal avenue presumably now closed following their signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and typically willing patsies for such signings Manchester United too cash-strapped to consider a bid, a move to Tottenham makes the most sense.",
      "They haven’t really got any defensive midfielders having not bothered with that sort of thing for a while, mate. And while Archie Gray is presumably still the long-term plan, he’s still a bit young and daft.",
      "",
      "4) Morgan Rogers (£48m) – Chelsea\nWhat absolutely none of us want is for Rogers to sign for a club that’s not going to play him in the season before a World Cup. The ideal would be for Rogers to be playing regularly for a team competing in the Champions League and challenging for trophies in a tournament campaign.",
      "Either of those things could happen at Chelsea, who have reportedly made him their ‘top target’ as they seek one more forward in preparation for the departures of Christopher Nkunku, Joao Felix and possibly Nicolas Jackson, whom Villa themselves are supposedly interested in.",
      "Villa have slapped an £80m price tag on him, presumably to ward off suitors rather than encouraging them as the 22-year-old – on the back of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio leaving after their loan spells – is the only clear hope for the future in Unai Emery’s attack. Then again, £80m is a lot of PSR wiggle room.",
      "",
      "3) Ollie Watkins (£36m) – Manchester United\nIt’s hard to imagine this summer transfer window not ending with Manchester United paying over the odds for Watkins having made a few quid on a couple of the bomb squad members when desperation to be rid of them sees lowball offers welcomed with open arms.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund struck what we would suggest is a HUGE BLOW by revealing he wants to stay at Old Trafford and fight what will presumably be a losing battle to start as United’s No.9 whether he actually has anyone to compete with for that position or not. Watkins’ reported interest in a move to United is likely as much to do with him being absolutely assured of a starting spot as much as anything else.",
      "Emery’s never been entirely convinced by Watkins, often starting Jhon Duran and then Rashford ahead of him, and given he turns 30 in December it feels like a good time to cash in, even if not quite at the full £60m they’re asking for.",
      "",
      "2) Leon Bailey (£24m) – Fenerbahce \nIt’s never quite worked for Bailey at Aston Villa but he’s by no means been terrible to the point where his value has plummeted – they bought him in 2021 for around £27m.",
      "Reports suggest Fenerbahce want a loan but Villa will hold out for his permanent transfer and a fee close to his valuation. Our guess is they may end up accepting a fair bit less to get him out of the door and off the wage bill.",
      "",
      "1) Jacob Ramsey (£28m) – Nottingham Forest\nForest want Ramsey as a replacement for Tottenham-bound Morgan Gibbs-White and this is the one with the most legs it seems, mainly and depressingly thanks to the two-word scourge of football – pure profit.",
      "We won’t get started on the ball-aching insanity of football clubs being encouraged to sell homegrown talent above all others to meet PSR demands, but it’s f***ing bullsh*t and looks set to force a transfer which we’re guessing neither Ramsey nor Villa actually want to happen.",
      "Former Liverpool and England striker Emile Heskey has warned Chelsea against signing Aston Villa attacker Morgan Rogers this summer.",
      "Liverpool are now preparing their second offer for Hugo Ekitike after Eintracht Frankfurt rejected their opening bid, according to reports.",
      "Chelsea have made the Aston Villa star their ‘top target’ and while a swap deal is ‘NOT on the cards’ it also sort of is…",
      "Newcastle are exploring striker options to replace Callum Wilson, with Ollie Watkins and Yoane Wissa being ‘discussed’, according to reports.",
      "It could cost Man Utd £100m to sign Ollie Watkins this summer as Roma enter the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund, according to reports.",

      "So far this summer, Man Utd have spent around £65m on two signings as they have landed Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "However, the Red Devils have endured a frustrating few weeks in the transfer market as they have struggled to reach a breakthrough in talks with Premier League rivals Brentford over Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have made it their priority to overhaul their attack after they were toothless in forward positions, as they struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s preferred formation.",
      "Mbeumo, like Cunha, would be an upgrade on United’s current No.10 options after the Brentford standout scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "The Red Devils made Mbeumo a top target and he’s reportedly decided that he prefers a move to Old Trafford over Spurs.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘close’ to sealing ‘bargain’ next signing as Prem star has ‘everything ready’ to join",
      "However, a deal for Mbeumo has proven difficult as Brentford can demand a sizable fee. The forward is only under contract until 2026, but they have an option to extend his deal on the same terms until 2027.",
      "Man Utd have already had a couple of bids rejected for Mbeumo this summer and a deal has stalled in recent weeks.",
      "It has also been reported that the Bees are unwilling to lose Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa this summer, but the latter is attracting fresh interest from Newcastle United.",
      "This appears to have alerted Man Utd, who made an ‘improved bid’ for Mbeumo on Thursday afternoon.",

      "‘Bryan Mbeumo has also indicated again he wants to leave.’",
      "Appearing on The United Stand, Jacobs also revealed United ‘will walk away’ if this offer is turned down, while Mbeumo has issued a one-word response to this proposal.",
      "The United Stand tweeted his comments, revealing: ‘Not only are Man United optimistic of getting the deal done, Bryan Mbeumo himself has told Brentford he thinks the offer is fair, and the move should happen before the USA tour.",
      "‘If Brentford outright reject the third bid and say it’s not near the valuation structure, then Man United will walk away.’",

      "As well as the attack, there have been rumours linking Man Utd with new goalkeepers, including Aston Villa stopper Martinez.",
      "That is because of the poor form of Andre Onana last season with some fans hoping that he will be sold in the summer and replaced by a different goalkeeper.",
      "READ: Mediawatch: Brentford ‘U-turn’ on Mbeumo as three Man United transfers solve everything",
      "And now a report in Clarin (via Sport Witness) – which is the biggest newspaper in Argentina – claim that Martinez is ‘close to joining’ Man Utd this summer.",
      "The Aston Villa goalkeeper has ‘everything ready’ to complete a transfer as Man Utd ‘have made the most progress in transfer talks’  with his €25m release clause meaning the Argentine is ‘a bargain that cannot be passed up’ by the Red Devils.",
      "Clarin insist that a transfer to Man Utd will be a ‘qualitative leap’ for Martinez as he would be joining ‘one of the most important clubs in the world’.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Wes Brown has already warned supporters that it isn’t as easy as “just selling” Onana if the Red Devils look to move him on this summer.",
      "Brown said recently: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold.",
      "“There’s a lot of factors. And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could miss out on two transfer targets, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on another potential signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, a Chelsea “hijack” on Manchester United for a £45m Premier League is “looking likely” during this summer’s transfer window.",
      "Chelsea have been ‘offered’ Emiliano Martinez for £45m amid Man Utd interest, but Fabrizio Romano says the Blues are focusing elsewhere.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are being forced to ‘turn to an alternative’ as they are ‘increasingly unlikely’ to land one transfer target."

Other clubs know United’s position. They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers.",
      "“I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment.

      "Man Utd made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, and have been pursuing Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Friday 18 July 2025 19:22, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th-place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some minor reasons to be optimistic about the current campaign.",
      "Matheus Cunha is in the building after his move from Wolves - but he may not be the only major forward coming into Old Trafford. Bryan Mbeumo's preference to join United - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign, with agreement having now been reached over a £71 million deal for the Cameroon international.",
      "On top of that, captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that 'left 10' role since Amorim took charge.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 23-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing the latter.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in at wing-back was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least brought in a profile that United lacked.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played then-17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira even confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits.",
      "But his forward's striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. Viktor Gyokeres' representatives were contacted about a potential move, but he is set to join Arsenal. Nicolas Jackson, Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko are the other situations United are monitoring.",
      "While United have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",

      "Wednesday 9 July 2025 15:05, UK",
      "Manchester United remain optimistic of agreeing a deal to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo in time for the forward to be part of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "United kick off their US tour with a game against West Ham in New Jersey on July 26.",
      "There remains a gap in valuation, but United are not far away from the overall fee Brentford want - believed to be £65m - however there is still work to do on the structure as the west London club want the majority, if not all, of the fee to be paid up front.",
      "Mbeumo has made it clear he only wants to move to United and personal terms are believed to have been agreed in principle.",
      "United are also still working on outgoings and, despite being given extra time to find a solution on his future, Marcus Rashford has returned to the club's training ground at Carrington.",
      "The striker is training away from the first team and using the club's medical and rehab facilities.",
      "Rashford's preference is a move to Barca, who have explored the conditions of a deal, but they have other targets in that position too such as Nico Williams and Luis Diaz.",
      "Williams has signed a new contract at Athletic Club and Liverpool have rejected all approaches for Diaz, however.",
      "Antony is another player United are happy to sell and Real Betis are still pushing for a deal for the winger.",
      "Talks between the clubs have been over a permanent deal - but it is thought the idea of another loan has been broached.",
      "However, for United to consider another loan this summer, it is thought they would want an obligation to buy him attached.",
      "The Betis president has admitted a permanent deal is difficult to do given the finances involved.",
      "Antony impressed on a straight loan in the second half of last season at Betis, scoring nine goals in 24 appearances.",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus and Napoli remain interested in a deal for United forward Jadon Sancho.",
      "Both clubs have been made aware by United what fee it would take to sign Sancho - believed to be £25m, with the sides both discussing terms with the England international's representatives.",
      "Juve have other targets, including Porto's Francsico Conceicao, however, and Sky in Italy are reporting that the Portugal international is their preferred choice.",
      "Conceicao was on a season-long loan in Turin last season and, until and including July 15, his release clause is €30m, which Porto want paid up front in full, although it goes up to €45m on July 16.",
