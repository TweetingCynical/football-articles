      "Kobbie Mainoo could be on the move this month(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may have very little time to convince Kobbie Mainoo to remain at Manchester United, if the rumour mill churns truth. The 44-year-old was announced as the Red Devils' interim head coach on Tuesday evening - a temporary successor to Ruben Amorim who was sacked earlier this month.",
      "While Carrick will be eager to guide United to the strongest-possible finish in the Premier League as the second-half of the season plays out, the Englishman will also be tasked with forging a relationship with an inherited squad. One player who Carrick would be wise to work matters out with sooner rather than later is undoubtedly Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old saw his game time limited under Amorim, making just one start this term under the Portuguese head coach - and that was in the form of an embarrassing Carabao Cup clash with Grimsby Town, in which, United crashed out on penalties.",
      "While Darren Fletcher deployed the youngster during the weekend's FA Cup fixture with Brighton, many fans will be eager to see what Carrick's plans for Mainoo are. As per the Mail, Mainoo's relationship with the United board is \"fragile\" after he failed to see a new contract last year.",
      "The midfielder is also understood to harbour no hopes of hanging around at his current club should his gametime continue to be hampered. It comes as a wealth of clubs have been linked Mainoo as of late, with Napoli thought to be the strongest contenders.",
      "The Serie A club have already demonstrated a keen eye for talent from the Red Devils, with Scott McTominay thriving since making the move to the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium in 2024. The Scottish international was named as the league's MVP in his debut season, where he also helped Napoli clinch the Serie A title.",
      "As a result, Carrick now has until the tail end of the transfer window to work matters out with Mainoo, or risk losing the young talent altogether - whether that be on loan or a permanent move. It comes as Carrick was unveiled as United's new interim head coach on Tuesday evening.",
      "Michael Carrick is the new interim Manchester United head coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "In a club statement on Manchester United's official website, the Red Devils wrote: \"Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Michael Carrick as head coach of the men’s first team until the end of the 2025/26 season. Carrick played 464 games for the club, winning five Premier League titles, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "\"He joined the first-team coaching staff when he retired in 2018 and served under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Following Solskjaer’s departure, Carrick led the club with distinction during his role as caretaker manager.\"",
      "Speaking about the appointment, Carrick explained: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour. I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here. There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Jason Wilcox said of the appointment: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United. He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has taken over as the new interim head coach of Man United(Image: PA)",
      "Michael Carrick has been announced as the new Manchester United interim head coach for the rest of the season, and the former midfielder has a straightforward mission ahead of him.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim while the club sat just outside the Champions League spots. His departure followed a day after his heated remarks following the Leeds United match earlier this month, during which he insisted on having greater authority as a 'manager' instead of a 'head coach.'",
      "Carrick returns to Old Trafford with United still fighting for a top-five position, and his entire attention will be directed towards the Premier League. Following Sunday's FA Cup elimination by Brighton and Hove Albion and the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town, there are no cup competitions to divert attention.",
      "The ex-Middlesbrough manager, who previously oversaw three matches in 2021 following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal, is known for deploying a 4-2-3-1 formation - a tactical approach that supporters have been demanding United adopt.",
      "Throughout Amorim's spell, the Portuguese manager persisted with his 3-4-3 system, with the exception of the 1-0 triumph over Newcastle. Yet, despite securing victory against Eddie Howe's team, Amorim returned to his three-at-the-back setup for the Wolves fixture.",
      "Reports suggest that Jason Wilcox informed Amorim he wasn't on the same level as other managers before his dismissal. The choice to adopt a more cautious approach at home against Wolves, who had just two points at that stage and United had beaten 4-1 only weeks earlier, is thought to have been poorly received.",
      "United supporters can breathe a sigh of relief as Carrick has already hinted at his forward-thinking approach to the game. The 44-year-old is believed to have taken inspiration from Sir Alex Ferguson, favouring an attacking and dominant style of play.",
      "In his autobiography 'Between the Lines', Carrick recounts a disagreement with Louis van Gaal over the decision to match Sheffield United's tactics in an FA Cup tie during his playing days.",
      "\"I'm not showing any disrespect to Sheffield United when I say this but I cried out for us to play our own game,\" Carrick penned.",
      "One player set to reap the benefits of Carrick's arrival is academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo. Under Amorim, Mainoo only made one start this season, despite being touted as a competitor for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "In a previous interview with Rio Ferdinand, Carrick revealed that Mainoo would be the cornerstone of his midfield.",
      "\"Yeah (would build around Mainoo),\" he stated. \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think Man Utd's got to have an element of that.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could play a key role under interim head coach Michael Carrick(Image: SmartFrame/News Images)",
      "\"They always have done and should always have that. To have a talent that he's shown already, you've got to have player that you can say 'right, they get it, they know it, let's help him, let's build him'.",
      "\"There's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",

      "Michael Carrick enjoyed a glittering career at Manchester United but even he wasn't immune to Sir Alex Ferguson's notorious hairdryer treatment. The 44-year-old has been announced as the club's interim manager for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "The former defensive midfielder bagged 12 major trophies with the Red Devils during his playing days, including five Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League. He seamlessly filled the void left by Roy Keane in United's midfield, heralding a fresh wave of success.",
      "Carrick's role on the pitch was often understated, primarily tasked with maintaining balance and dictating the tempo of games from midfield. While his contributions might have been overlooked by outsiders, there was one instance when he attracted Ferguson's ire for all the wrong reasons.",
      "The incident occurred during the 2008 Club World Cup final against Ecuadorian outfit Liga de Quito, which was goalless at half-time. Despite Carrick's insistence that all but one of his passes had been forward during the first 45 minutes, Ferguson begged to differ and made his views abundantly clear during the break.",
      "In his 2018 autobiography, Between the Lines, Carrick recalled: \"The moment I entered the changing room, the boss launched into me. 'Pass the ball f****** forward, I f****** told you'. Sir Alex was raging.",
      "\"When he was like that you had to sit there and take it, let him blow off some steam. On the outside, I was calm, nodding at the boss's points, hiding my anger.",
      "\"On the inside, I was fuming saying to myself, 'I must have played 40 passes forward here and he's picked the one where I've gone back'. But the boss was so wound up that I didn't dare voice my defence.\"",
      "United, who had earned their place in the Club World Cup in Yokohama following their Champions League triumph, went on to secure the silverware with a 1-0 win. Wayne Rooney scored the all-important goal, even though they were reduced to 10 men after Nemanja Vidic saw red.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has previously praised Michael Carrick's time at United(Image: PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Ferguson losing his cool with Carrick was probably a rare blip, considering the midfielder's reliability, given that the legendary boss oversaw 319 of his 464 matches for the club. Having arrived from Tottenham Hotspur in 2006, Ferguson was immediately convinced that Carrick would thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "\"One of the things that stuck out to me when we were profiling him and preparing to make a bid was that as a young boy, 16 years of age, he left home to play for West Ham,\" Ferguson explained.",
      "\"That tells you that the boy had the confidence that he was going to make it. A 16-year-old kid from Newcastle going to east London, that's a trek, and it impressed me.",
      "Michael Carrick previously had a three-game spell as United caretaker manager in 2021(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"From the minute we bought Michael in 2006, his character has always been outstanding. He's a football man and that character, coupled with his ability, made him a certainty to be a big success at United.\"",
      "Following his retirement in 2018, Carrick took up a coaching role at United under Jose Mourinho and continued in the position during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure. However, he parted ways with the club when Ralf Rangnick took over the reins.",
      "His next appointment was as Middlesbrough manager in October 2022, a post he held until the conclusion of the previous season. Carrick's first match as United's interim boss will the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Saturday.",

      "Marcus Rashford is keen to join Barcelona on a permanent basis from Manchester United(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "Barcelona are reportedly in discussions with Manchester United over the possibility of signing Marcus Rashford on a permanent basis this summer. The 28 year old's loan stint is drawing to a close, and the Catalan giants are eager to secure his services permanently - but there's a catch.",
      "As per talkSPORT, Barcelona are hesitant to trigger Rashford's €30million (£26m) purchase clause and instead, aim to negotiate a reduced fee. A second loan spell, possibly with a conditional obligation to buy, has also been mooted as an alternative.",
      "Further talks are anticipated as the season draws to a close, with both clubs seeking a resolution. United are keen to capitalise on Rashford and believe the clause is fair, while Barcelona have the upper hand given the winger's wish to stay at Camp Nou.",
      "While his dream may yet come true, the La Liga heavyweights are hoping to negotiate a more financially favourable deal before committing to the current purchase option. If an agreement is reached, it's reported that Rashford would be offered a contract until the summer of 2029.",
      "The 28-year-old England international is expected to play a more prominent role in Catalonia next season if a deal can be struck, particularly with Robert Lewandowski, who turns 38 in August, out of contract at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford has already expressed his desire to stay at the club beyond his loan period. \"Of course what I want is to stay at Barca,\" Rashford said.",

      "Marcus Rashford has lifted his first trophy with Barcelona(Image: )",
      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "Meanwhile, European football expert Andy Brassell has suggested that Rashford represents the 'most sensible' financial option currently available.",
      "\"He's maybe the cheapest financial deal out there,\" he observed. \"They may even loan him for an extra year. He's taken a fair hit on his wages and if United are keen on moving him on permanently and if something can be worked out.",
      "\"It feels like one of the best deals out there for Barcelona because they know he works there already. There's not as much risk as there would be buying a player fresh.",
      "\"I think if they go out there and try and buy someone of Marcus Rashford's quality on the open market, it's going to be a heck of a lot more expensive. We've got to bear in mind as well that next season, they'll probably, almost certainly, have Robert Lewandowski's wages off the books.\"",
      "Rashford has made a significant impression since arriving at Barcelona, notching seven goals and 11 assists in 27 appearances. However, he has found himself in and out of the starting line-up recently, with Raphinha being favoured on the left flank.",
      "On Sunday, Rashford lifted his first trophy with his new teammates as the Catalan club secured a 3-2 triumph over Real Madrid in the Supercopa final in Jeddah.",

      "That instant, game‐changing spark Chelsea have often lacked from their wide players. The Athletic claims the Blues have 'already shown' that adding another attacker is firmly on their agenda this year, with the aim of easing the burden on Cole Palmer.",
      "In addition to a new winger, the report notes that Chelsea would also look to accelerate their plans to sign a midfielder and a defender now rather than waiting until the summer, if the right opportunities arise.",
      "Both Garnacho and Jamie Gittens have struggled to find the confidence and consistency needed when handed chances in the first team.",
      "With another attacker potentially on the way soon, Garnacho could soon face increased competition at Chelsea - a situation he encountered similarly at United after the fallout with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Before his switch to Chelsea, Garnacho was seen as a future star at United, but the relationship between the player and the club eventually soured.",
      "Chelsea swooped in for the Argentinian in August, shelling out £40million following his disagreement with former United boss Amorim.",
      "Upon leaving Old Trafford, the winger confessed that parting ways wasn't hard. He even suggested that departing United was a necessary step for his growth.",
      "When questioned if he had any regrets, Garnacho simply said: \"No.\"",
      "He further explained: \"Sometimes in life you need to change things to take a step forward or improve as a player.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho in action for Chelsea(Image: SmartFrame/SportImage)",
      "\"It was the right moment, and the right club. So it was an easy decision.\"",
      "Last season, Garnacho started 23 out of a possible 36 Premier League matches, but concerns about his attitude ultimately hindered his progress.",
      "Prior to his move to Chelsea, he had been relegated to United's 'bomb squad' and excluded from Amorim's pre-season plans.",

      "Michael Carrick's transfer plans at Manchester United seem to have been revealed(Image: Getty)",
      "Michael Carrick will be the man to take over at Manchester United in the interim after the sacking of Ruben Amorim. The former midfielder's plans in the January transfer window have also reportedly been disclosed.",
      "Amorim was shown the exit door after just 14 months at the helm, and Darren Fletcher was left in charge of United's 2-2 draw against Burnley in the Premier League and a disappointing FA Cup exit at the hands of Brighton last time out.",
      "But it has now been revealed that Carrick is the coach who'll take United to the end of the season, as the search for a permanent successor to Amorim rolls on.",
      "According to The Athletic, Carrick, who previously took over at United as caretaker manager for three matches after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked, will not see the club's long-term transfer plans change for him.",
      "Before his appointment, it was disclosed that during this window, United would only move for long-term targets should they become available, or to prevent rival teams from poaching them.",
      "Carrick has taken charge of United before(Image: Getty)",
      "These players reportedly include Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. A new update claims that under Carrick this will not change and there won't be a case of signing any new players for the new head coach specifically.",
      "In the coming windows, United supposedly wish to recruit two new midfielders to add to their team, with Elliot Anderson their first-choice target in that area.",
      "As Carrick arrives, there has been an exit at Carrington. Young academy winger Sam Mather has announced he has left the club after spending 14 years amongst their ranks.",
      "The Salford-born wide player signed his first professional contract with the club in 2021 and was part of an FA Youth Cup-winning squad. He went with United on their pre-season tour of the United States in 2024.",
      "Having spent most of last season on loan at Tranmere Rovers, he has now joined Turkish Super Lig side Kayserispor and released a heartfelt farewell on Instagram.",
      "Mather spent 14 years with United(Image: Getty)",
      "\"After 14 years my time at Man Utd has come to an end,\" wrote Mather. \"I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.",
      "\"I will always be grateful for my time here and wish the club all the best. On a personal note, it's time for me to move forward and I can't wait to get started!\"",

      "Michael Carrick will be hoping to make his interim role a permanent one(Image: Photo by Matthew Lewis/Getty Images)",
      "This time last year, Michael Carrick’s Middlesbrough were preparing for a trip to Portsmouth, where they would face a team that had lost five of their previous seven Championship matches. Middlesbrough were beaten at Fratton Park and would then lose five of their next six games, a disastrous run that effectively condemned them to another campaign in the second tier.",
      "A year on and Carrick has one of the biggest jobs in world football. To label the situation bizarre would be kind. To describe it as a farce is more accurate.",
      "But, as the modern saying goes, it is what it is. And never mind the fact that he has only been appointed until the end of the season, the well-respected, personable Carrick has a dream role that is now his to lose.",
      "This is no old-timer popping in to help out, this is no rookie stepping up from the junior teams. Carrick is 44, approaching what some would consider to be a prime age for modern management.",
      "Carrick managed 136 games at Middlesbrough, a big and challenging club to look after. There were some who suggested, after he was sacked around the same time as Ange Postecoglou lost his Tottenham job, that Carrick would have been a good fit at Spurs.",
      "Essentially, Carrick failed at Middlesbrough, where a return to the Premier League is the only brief for the manager. But his reputation is sound.",
      "Michael Carrick enjoyed some good times in his tenure as Middlesbrough boss but failed to get them promoted to the Premier League(Image: George Wood/Getty Images)",
      "And even though a club such as Manchester United should normally be demanding an established, stellar, managerial name, there are instances of odd-looking appointments working well. A route does not have to be tried and trusted.",
      "It is not quite the same but who would have thought Bayern Munich would give their job to a manager who had just got Burnley relegated with a club record low of 24 points? It has not worked out too badly for Bayern and Vincent Kompany.",
      "Managing and coaching this elite calibre of player might suit Carrick and there is a clarity to the task ahead that should help. United are creating plenty of scoring chances, they are carrying plenty of threat.",
      "Vincent Kompany was an odd-looking appointment for Bayern Munich but has been a success in Germany(Image: PA)",
      "Converting more of those opportunities and conceding fewer goals - only the Premier League’s bottom six have let in more than United - is easier said than done but he will have excellent technical assistance from Steve Holland. They will certainly have plenty of time to work on the training ground - United and Carrick will have 17 fixtures in 19 weeks.",
      "If United fail to finish in a Champions League spot, Carrick is out. Simple as that. If they do get a Champions League slot, the board will have a dilemma.",
      "Fifth might be good enough and, even if it is not, fourth place should be attainable for United. Below the top three right now, the standard is much of a muchness.",
      "Jonathan Woodgate will be part of Michael Carrick's backroom team at Manchester United(Image: (Trevor Wilkinson | MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images))",
      "You have to go back to the 2003/004 season to find a team in fourth place with 35 points or lower after 21 matches (Liverpool’s current state). Fourth and fifth places are there for the taking. It would be a mildly commendable achievement to finish in one of those spots - not a startling one.",
      "But the bottom line is that if Carrick manages to take this dysfunctional United into the Champions League, it will be mission accomplished and he should get the nod for next season. Is it a farce? Yes, pretty much so. But Carrick is a sound footballing character and this could yet have a good ending.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick's Manchester United comeback is set to be confirmed, with the coach rekindling ties with several members of the current squad. Among those he'll be reunited with is Amad, who worked under Carrick during his second spell as caretaker manager back in late 2021.",
      "Amad, 23, spent the opening months of the 2021/22 season at Old Trafford following his switch from Atalanta. Carrick was serving on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching team when the winger arrived, then departed in December 2021 after Ralf Rangnick took over as interim boss.",
      "The 2008 Champions League-winner returns to Carrington in comparable circumstances. However, he's had further dealings with Amad since leaving United, thanks to the player's previous loan move to Sunderland.",
      "The two found themselves as rivals in a north-east derby when the Black Cats triumphed 2-0 over Carrick's Middlesbrough in January 2023. Amad netted to seal the Championship victory in that encounter, earning praise from his former assistant manager.",
      "\"He does what he does,\" said Carrick at the time. \"He's really talented, Amad. Good in tight spaces and does what he does with the ball.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has already shared his views on Amad, and vice versa(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"For the goal, that's what he brings and I think that's what he's maybe brought a bit more is his end product from when I knew him when he was a little bit younger a couple of years ago. He's doing really well.\"",
      "Carrick continued by saying he knew Amad \"very well\" thanks to their shared history at United and praised him as a \"terrific footballer.\" Most impressively, though, the manager observed that the Ivorian had \"jumped up a level again\" since he'd last worked closely with the player.",
      "Amad had already spoken glowingly about Carrick and the legacy he left at Old Trafford. When he joined United in early 2021, the winger was happy to switch from his preferred No. 19 to the No. 16 shirt because it had been worn by club icons such as Carrick and Roy Keane.",
      "Carrick has previously shared his praise of Amad, whom he worked with following his 2021 arrival at United(Image: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images)",
      "However, only one of those legends featured in Amad's tribute when he said: \"When I was told that I was getting the No. 16 shirt, I was happy because I know that Michael Carrick had previously worn that shirt for a long time and so it is a number worn by a legend of the club. So I have to respect the number and the players who wore it before me.\"",
      "It could be seen as another sign of respect that Amad has kept the No. 16 ever since. That's despite the fact his improved standing in the squad has probably given him chances to switch if he wanted to.",
      "Amad may be happy to see Carrick get another crack at United's helm(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Amad is expected to be available for Saturday's Manchester derby following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations. The Ivory Coast were eliminated from the competition after a 3-2 defeat to Egypt, freeing up the forward to resume his club responsibilities.",
      "Ruben Amorim had regularly used Amad as a right wing-back before his departure for the AFCON, which resulted in him missing United's last six matches. All eyes are now on Carrick and the tactics he'll employ for his debut against Manchester City, but it's evident Amad is one player who seems to have impressed him ahead of the big match.",

      "Manchester United may be on the verge of losing out on a player who has been strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford. And the player in question could be set to join forces with ex-United star Scott McTominay, who left the Red Devils almost two years ago.",
      "McTominay was sold by United to Napoli in the summer of 2024 for a cool £26.4million (€30.5 million), and he's been thriving at the Serie A giants since leaving Old Trafford.",
      "The Scotland international played a key role in Napoli's Serie A title win last season, netting 21 goals in 63 appearances since his arrival, including eight this season.",
      "Despite already having McTominay on their books, Italian news outlet Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is now in their sights.",
      "The report even suggests that Napoli have already struck a deal with Gomes for a move to the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, but they're yet to agree a fee with Wolves for the Brazilian international who is reportedly valued at around £41million.",
      "United have previously been associated with a move for Gomes, with rumours dating back to 2022 when the midfielder was still at Flamengo.",
      "Gomes made the switch to the Premier League in 2023, opting to sign for Wolves over United, and has been linked with a move to Old Trafford ever since last summer.",
      "However, according to the latest speculation from Italy, it appears that Napoli are leading the race to sign Gomes, which would see McTominay team up with the Brazilian midfielder.",
      "Recent reports have suggested that McTominay might make a return to United, though Napoli's sporting director Giovanni Manna has refuted these claims.",

      "Joao Gomes has previously been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "\"We're waiting for [Frank] Anguissa, who is an important player, to come back,\" Manna said. \"We've missed him a lot. McTominay is showing that he can be decisive in that role. The coach will make his evaluations.\"",
      "McTominay was recently the star for Napoli as he scored both goals for his club in the 2-2 draw with Inter Milan in Serie A at the weekend.",
      "The result leaves Antonio Conte's side in fourth place in the Italian top flight and four points adrift of leaders Inter, with AC Milan and Juventus also ahead of them in the table.",

      "The decision has been made. Michael Carrick will be Manchester United's interim manager until the end of the season, edging out Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after the pair held talks with the scrambling Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "Carrick, 44, will take the wheel on an interim basis, as United fight for Champions League football between now and May. But what about beyond that?",
      "Could the ex-Middlesbrough boss do what Solskjaer did in 2019 and convince United to give him the job permanently? Or should the Red Devils look elsewhere for Ruben Amorim's long-term successor?",
      "Forget the interim title, Michael Carrick is the Manchester United manager and will be next season if he takes the club into the Champions League. It is a 17-match audition and the equation is if he wins a lot more than he loses, the permanent gig is his.",
      "Carrick is no rookie. He managed 136 games at Middlesbrough, a big and challenging club to look after. He is 44 years of age, approaching what some would consider to be a prime age for modern management.",
      "Bringing in Steve Holland is a shrewd move and United only have 17 matches in four months. They should be fit and fresh for every game, and have a talented squad that has clearly been under-achieving.",
      "No, Carrick is not a big managerial name but he has potential and was hugely respected as a player. And don't forget, if penny-pinching Sir Jim Ratcliffe can avoid paying a king's ransom for a marquee appointment - a Thomas Tuchel or the like - he will.",

      "Michael Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough after two-and-a-half years in charge(Image: George Wood/Getty Images)",
      "Given the size of the challenge, United need to appoint a proven winner. Someone with experience of handling the pressures and expectations of a huge club. A manager with great leadership and the kudos to be able to persuade top-class players to sign for United.",
      "Which means United bosses have a small pool to work with. Thomas Tuchel would be too combustible, Carlo Ancelotti is unlikely to want the job, while Mauricio Pochettino doesn't quite tick all of the above boxes. And supporters would desert the club if Gareth Southgate is appointed.",
      "Which means United should move heaven and earth to lure Luis Enrique to Old Trafford. He does tick all the boxes and appears to be the right man to lead United back to the big time.",
      "Luis Enrique's future at Paris Saint-Germain is reportedly uncertain(Image: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "United can dress this up as an interim appointment all they like, but if he does well, there is no chance they get rid and start again. Carrick feels like an ideal appointment for INEOS and the bumbling bunch of 'experts' in place at Old Trafford.",
      "He will give players freedom, trust the club's academy and - perhaps most importantly - not kick up a fuss at being told which players they are signing. The club clearly isn't set up to be run by an all-controlling manager, that isn't what they want. Carrick might be.",
      "I can see United finishing the season in the top four. That should be enough to keep him in the dugout until at least this time next year.",
      "Manchester United have tried all manner of new appointments since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. They've had the hand-picked successor (David Moyes), the born winner (Jose Mourinho), the 'knows the club' option (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer), the interim ship-steadier (Ralf Rangnick), the flavour-of-the-month overseas option (Erik ten Hag) and the 'seems to hate everyone at the club’ option (Ruben Amorim).",
      "After all that, what's left? The ideal would presumably be someone who can give the players the big hug they need while also being a tactical maverick and never arguing with the higher-ups.",
      "Oh, and also United should get a prize for appointing them, maybe a lollipop and a pat on the back for being the smartest boy in the class. Sadly for them, we don't live in fantasy land and they might need to, shock horror, compromise on some things.",
      "Either that or wait until England win the World Cup and get Thomas Tuchel on board at a point where there's enough goodwill to get them through those difficult first few months. Sure, let's go with that.",
      "Thomas Tuchel's deal with the FA runs until the end of the World Cup(Image: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick could put himself right in the shop window with a decent six-month spell or so but I don't think he'll be the next permanent Manchester United manager. There's been lots of talk of Oliver Glasner after his work at Crystal Palace but the United job is bigger than it's ever been.",
      "So for me, it's a no-brainer: go and get Thomas Tuchel after the World Cup. I'm still not really sure why Chelsea decided to sack Tuchel and if there's even a remote chance that he can be lured back to the Premier League after overseeing England's World Cup campaign, then surely the Old Trafford powerbrokers have to to take it - even if that means a less than ideal start to pre-season given (hopefully) Tuchel will be tied up to the very end of the tournament.",
      "Compared to the other names in the frame, Tuchel is the standout option. He has the pedigree to take on a job like Manchester United, plus Premier League experience to boot. It's a long way back for United, but if anyone can get them back on the right track, surely it's Tuchel.",
      "Oliver Glasner's contract with Crystal Palace expires in June(Image: Alex Livesey - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Oliver Glasner. Provided he doesn't finish his Crystal Palace stint with a whimper, the Austrian will be a man in demand. In all honesty, even if things don't end well, he's done more than enough at Selhurst Park to prove himself and it is well documented that he's consistently lost his best players.",
      "His contract in up in the summer and he's not been shy in voicing his frustration, wishing the club had backed him more in the market. Easy to forget, he also has a Europa League win with Eintracht Frankfurt on his CV and his playing style has attracted plenty of plaudits.",
      "The only question mark is his ability to take charge of a heavyweight club, something he's not done yet. Glasner has all the hallmarks of someone who can step up and this feels like the point in his career when taking on that challenge is right.",

      "Alonso, 44, was only eight months into his role at the Spanish giants. His departure spells the availability of an individual who was the most coveted manager two summers ago.",
      "Alongside Liverpool reportedly wanting their former star to replace Jurgen Klopp, Bayern Munich and Madrid were both interested in appointing him as their head coach. He opted to remain at Bayer Leverkusen for last season, with the Red Devils also told no by Alonso before deciding to hand Erik ten Hag a contract extension, according to The Mail.",
      "The report lined up with a previous claim that indicated that the ex-Spain international would be reluctant to take the job at Old Trafford because of his long-standing ties to Liverpool.",
      "Despite it being almost 17 years since Alonso left Anfield to join Madrid, he remains a fan favourite at Anfield and previously admitted that he remains close to the club he described as a \"family.\"",
      "Xabi Alonso is now a free agent after leaving Real Madrid(Image: Naomi Baker - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "When returning to Anfield in 2022 for a charity game, he told Liverpool's club website: \"Once a Red, always a Red. It's not a logo, I think it's a reality. Not just my case, I think that most of us feel really close to the club.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's U-turn was the biggest mistake of his Manchester United tenure(Image: Getty)",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had a clear aim when he was appointed Manchester United boss in 2018. The club’s legendary striker arrived as interim manager in December 2018, before stepping into the role on a permanent basis three months later following a string of impressive results.",
      "His main objective was to remove any of the team’s deadwood and replace them with hungry youngsters possessing the so-called ‘Manchester United DNA’, in line with the club’s fundamental philosophy since the era of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "That process was not immediate, having taken several transfer windows to get rid of the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, both of whom were on big money and underperforming. Youngsters such as Dan James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were instead brought in as promising talents with the hope they would realise their potential at Old Trafford.",
      "His approach was combined with an effort to help the youngsters who needed time to settle by splashing big money on players deemed more ready to win, with Harry Maguire’s £80million transfer being one example. The plan appeared to work briefly, at least at face value, with United finishing third in 2019/20 and second in 2020/21.",
      "Yet, there were signs even then that Solskjaer’s transitional period had hit a wall. Several of his younger players notably failed to develop how he would have wished.",
      "In terms of his own managerial skill, the Norwegian’s counter-attacking style worked in big games but it was clear he lacked the tactical know-how of his contemporaries, Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola. That meant United didn’t have a clear and modern identity when it came to breaking down supposedly lesser Premier League opposition. Solskjaer also struggled to figure out his best XI, leading to inconsistency in results.",
      "There was a knee-jerk reaction to that in the summer of 2021, which prompted Solskjaer and the United hierarchy to sign ready-made superstars. Edinson Cavani was brought in on a free transfer to complement the existing attack, which was itself a shrewd decision as he proved in his first season.",
      "But adding the injury-prone £41m Real Madrid legend Raphael Varane, along with Cristiano Ronaldo late in the window due to fan-pressure and for commercial reasons, confirmed a departure from his own managerial philosophy and the foundations he had put into place. They were essentially purchased to bring overnight success with little consideration for how they would fit in at United and who they would unsettle.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s big-money signing after a long transfer saga earlier that summer was more in line with what Solskjaer had planned for the club. Yet, the U-turn to instead bank on a veteran Ronaldo stunted his growth and he arguably later proved to be a bad fit generally for Premier League football.",
      "The summer of 2021 was the beginning of the end of Solskjaer(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo himself enjoyed a fruitful first campaign back at Old Trafford but his lack of pressing proved detrimental to the team’s overall performances. The Portugal international’s arrival brought unnecessary drama to United as the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood clearly regressed.",
      "With a plethora of egos now in his inflated squad and just 11 starting places each week, results faltered and players began to lose faith in Solskjaer’s project. A dismal run of results to start the 2021/22 season culminated in a 4-1 defeat at Watford, with the manager well aware that his time was up.",
      "He was sacked the following morning by Ed Woodward, having deviated from his own blueprint and failed to cultivate the culture he wanted, with United arguably in a worse position than when he took over. Ralf Rangnick was brought in as his long-term successor, offering a very different plan for United, only to leave in the summer of 2022.",
      "Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim were both appointed in the years since and, in defence of Solskjaer, fell short to varying degrees when it came to the success of their signings, consistency in results and offering an effective playing style.",
      "Carrick has been appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "However, last week, a full circle moment presented itself to Solskjaer, following Amorim’s sacking after his falling out with club bosses over tactics and player arrivals. The Norwegian was one of the candidates considered to take over as interim manager until the end of the 2025/26 season, along with Michael Carrick.",
      "Solskjaer would have been desperate to take over the reins and right the wrongs of his rollercoaster tenure. But it has since emerged that Carrick, his own former assistant, impressed the United hierarchy with his vision and will take over instead.",
      "It is also understood that some of the current crop of United players were not excited by the prospect of his return, expressing their lack of confidence in Solskjaer to club officials. As such, it’s fair to say the ghosts of Solskjaer’s first Old Trafford tenure crushed his biggest managerial dream once again.",

      "Luis Enrique is high on Manchester United's wanted list(Image: FIFA via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have made Luis Enrique one of their main targets in the club’s search for a permanent manager. United are appointing Michael Carrick as interim boss until the end of this season.",
      "Club bosses will then look to choose a full-time manager in the summer. Candidates being considered include Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Carlo Ancelotti. And now it has emerged Enrique is also a target of the fallen giants. It’s understood United’s owners want to appoint someone who can handle the huge pressure and expectation that comes with being in charge. Two-time Champions League winner Enrique has a wealth of managerial experience, having taken charge of Spain, Barcelona and now Paris Saint Germain.",
      "The 55-year-old won nine major trophies with Barca, including the Champions League in 2015. The Spaniard has gone on to land another 10 trophies with PSG - including his second European crown. Enrique’s PSG conquered Europe last season - thrashing Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.",
      "Enrique is said to have the 'winning pedigree' United need with their next appointment.",
      "Interestingly, Enrique will be entering the final 12 months of his PSG contract in June and has not agreed a new deal. If this is still the case come the summer, United would not have a massive amount of compensation to pay PSG.",
      "Speculation has mounted that he will leave the French giants this summer, although he has denied this and could still pen a new contract. It also remains to be seen if United can lure Enrique to Old Trafford, considering the current state of the club and size of the challenges ahead.",

      "Tony O'Neill now lives a much different life (Image: Webby & O'Neill/Youtube)",
      "One of Britain’s most notorious former football hooligans once fled Millwall away at half-time in 1974 – after fearing he was going to die on the eve of his 16th birthday.",
      "Tony O’Neill, who has been caged three times for football offences and was once known as ‘the general’ in the Red Army firm, was in the stands when he witnessed “the most sickening beating” he had ever seen in his life, before he escaped the stadium after being outed as a Manchester United fan.",
      "He was just 15 at the time and he remembered hitching his way to London in his school blazer for the highly anticipated fixture.",
      "His beloved Manchester United were playing in the old Second Division and the first game of that season was Millwall at Old Trafford which he called “one of the biggest letdowns I have had as a young lad looking for excitement”.",
      "He said he “expected riots” but only a handful of Millwall fans showed up and he said he ended up pitying them after they got a “brutal beating” outside the ground where they apparently took an \"unnecessary\" amount of blows.",
      "He said it all kicked off behind the goal at Millwall's old stadium (Image: NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "However, the away fixture happened just weeks later, on September 16, 1974, and Tony spoke about it on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series.",
      "Tony admitted that he was “fearful” of the away trip, mainly because it fell on a Monday night, and at the time, not as many of the aggressive fans would travel on a weekday.",
      "After getting to London, he waited at Euston for his fellow Manchester United fans to arrive, and he remembered: “People come off that train like I had never seen before… quiet as a mouse. Normally you get a football special turning up to Euston and people are in full voice all ready for the game, chanting, shouting, screaming, all up for the day’s action.”",
      "He said the train was nowhere near full and he added: “It was a frightening feeling and I mean frightening. I am 15 and thinking, 'This is bad.' Like I say, we were all worried.”",
      "However, after getting off at New Cross, the footie mob was “shocked” after being greeted by a deadly silence.",
      "Tony is now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black(Image: Webby & O'Neill/Youtube)",
      "They then had an “eerie” walk to The Old Den where again they experienced no trouble from the home fans.",
      "However, there was confusion at the turnstiles, and United fans ended up being spread out in different parts of the ground.",
      "And explaining what happened minutes before kick off, Tony said a group of Man Utd fans behind one goal started chanting.",
      "He recalled: “They were in the middle of the terracing and me as a young lad, 15 years of age, I know this is a big mistake. In the middle of the terracing, a few hundred of you, you’re going to get swamped. You’re going to get it.”",
      "Tony said the chants did not last long after swarms of Millwall fans began to charge from all sides to get at the small group of United supporters who soon tried to scatter.",
      "And Tony remembered: “I witnessed the most sickening, at that time, the most sickening beating… I couldn’t believe it. I was helpless. I was really sick.",
      "“I seen stretchers and I seen one geezer, could have been a kid I don’t know, I haven’t got a clue, but I seen one kid carried out on a stretcher. But I just saw people being swung about, not loads, just a few people getting a beating. And I was sickened by it, stood there on the flood lights on my own.”",
      "Millwall's stadium is now called The Den (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Shortly before half-time, paranoia set in for Tony, who felt he had started to be singled out by Millwall fans around him for being from Manchester, despite being too afraid to speak throughout the opening 45 minutes.",
      "Moving into the concourse, he stood by a group of policemen, and he knew he had to make a decision. He said: “I was stood by these coppers because I was fearful and thought I’m going to die.”",
      "The young lad, who was turning 16 the next day, waited for people to return to the terraces, before jumping over a turnstile to get out of the ground. He said his safety was his number one priority and that he was not going to risk going back into the stands.",
      "“People don’t understand,” he said. “You open your mouth, a northerner, a Manc, you’re dead, you’re finished. I know it, everyone knows it.”",
      "Tony eventually made it to safety, but rather than getting a train back to Manchester to Euston as planned, he ended up in a pub with two United fans who lived in London, and so stayed the night in the capital.",
      "He said there have been many myths about what happened between the two firms in the 1974/1975 season, but he stated that no mob travelled to the home of the other and caused havoc.",
      "And giving a sense of what it was actually like, Tony, now an author who started working for Gary Neville's Hotel Football in 2017, said: “The reality of Millwall is a very very frightening place on a Monday night. I experienced it and I wouldn’t like to experience it again.",
      "\"It's a very dangerous place. The area itself, the Millwall fans, are renowned for coming from that area, living in that area, and very few people look forward to going to Millwall.",
      "“It didn’t matter who you were, you were going to get a good hiding. But the fact is you come to Old Trafford you were going to get a good hiding and everyone knew it. And if you went to Newcastle you would get a good hiding if you turned up.",
      "“That was football – that was football in the early 70s. That’s the way it was until the introduction of tickets.”",

Carrick is expected to be confirmed as United boss until the end of the season on Tuesday after an agreement in principle was reached.",
      "The 44-year-old, who emerged as the club's preferred candidate after talks with chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, is expected to take charge of his first training session on Wednesday. Saturday's Manchester derby is likely to be Carrick's first match in the dugout as he aims to steady the ship on the touchline.",
      "However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster believes there are also deeper problems that require addressing behind the scenes. The ex-England stopper has now suggested club legend Keane should be appointed to the role of sporting director to tackle the lack of fight being displayed on the pitch.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, Foster said: \"I'm going to put this out there. I think somebody like Roy Keane should be a Manchester United sporting director, somebody who understands the exact type of player that needs to be playing for Manchester United.",
      "\"I want somebody who's going to pick me players that will go out there every day and just battle. If the owners trust him, which they should do, then it's a match made in heaven.\"",
      "Foster's comments come at a time when United's lack of resilience has again been thrust into the spotlight. The club's FA Cup exit to Brighton on Sunday in a 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford prompted caretaker boss Darren Fletcher to accuse the team of being \"fragile\" and lacking the necessary resolve to dig themselves out of trouble.",
      "Goals from Brajan Gruda and Danny Welbeck sent Brighton through to the fourth round, despite a late goal from Benjamin Sesko. As boos rang around the stadium at full-time, Fletcher did not hold back in his post-match assessment.",
      "Darren Fletcher bemoaned Manchester United's fragility following their FA Cup exit against Brighton(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "He said: \"The players are fragile. They need to build themselves up and respond. Confidence is one of the most powerful things in football, but when you don't have it, you have to dig deep.",
      "\"They have to come together. It's only the players that can do something about it. They have to find a way to win. It's about hard work, attitude and application.\"",
      "Foster believes that assessment underlines exactly why a figure like Keane is needed in a senior footballing role, tasked with reshaping the squad's mentality as well as its quality.",
      "Danny Welbeck was on target for Brighton as Man Utd crashed out of the FA Cup(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "The former Watford and Wrexham keeper added: \"Look what Fletch said after the game - he basically said that we weren't good enough. You can see that we were fragile.",
      "\"When you're fragile and you're not good enough, you need to battle. You've got to scrap and do all the dirty, ugly things. They didn't really do that, whereas other teams will be better and win more games and be higher up in the league just purely through battling.",
      "\"He [Keane] is somebody who can identify those players who have that nasty little bite in them, that intensity and that will to want to win every single game.\"",

      "Michael Carrick is set bacome Manchester United interim manager(Image: Soccrates Images, Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is set to tackle several urgent matters as Manchester United's interim manager. The club legend has agreed in principle to take over for the rest of the season, with his contract currently being finalised.",
      "The 44-year-old, who could be at the helm for the Manchester derby on Saturday, was formerly part of United's coaching team under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He also had a brief three-match stint as caretaker boss in 2021, securing victories against Arsenal and Villarreal and a draw with Chelsea, prior to Ralf Rangnick's arrival.",
      "After departing Old Trafford, Carrick took up the role of Middlesbrough manager in October 2022, a position he held until the end of last season. It has been reported that his plans for the remainder of the campaign have impressed the United hierarchy but he faces some pivotal decisions during his tenure.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has had a challenging season so far. The United academy graduate wasn't the first choice under Ruben Amorim, having only started once this season in the Carabao Cup before the Portuguese coach was sacked.",
      "With a new manager stepping in, the 20-year-old will have a fresh start following constant speculation about his future. Promisingly for the United hopeful, his past performances have already earned Carrick's approval, with the former Boro boss speaking highly of the England international during the summer.",
      "Discussing Mainoo, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that has come through the academy, knows the club and feels it - that's massive. To have a talent like that, as he's already shown, you've got to say: 'Right, he gets it, he knows it - let's help him, build on him, and stick with him. I think there's definitely a place for him.\"",
      "These comments suggest Mainoo could be in line for more first team action under Carrick compared to what he might have experienced under Amorim, which would be welcome news for United supporters.",
      "Having previously worked alongside Bruno Fernandes during his time on Solskjaer's coaching staff, Carrick is well-versed in the United captain's abilities. Over 310 appearances for the club, he has netted 103 goals and registered 95 assists, often dragging his side over the line through his individual brilliance.",
      "Yet, United nearly faced losing him after Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal tabled a £100million offer for the Portuguese playmaker. While the bid was turned down, Fernandes recently admitted feeling wounded by suggestions that the club were content to let him leave.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has previously been the subject of transfer interest(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "One of Carrick's primary objectives will be reassuring Fernandes that his long-term future remains at Old Trafford. Although he may only be a temporary appointment, the caretaker manager can demonstrate the club are moving in the right direction through encouraging performances during his brief tenure.",
      "While Mainoo could be poised for more action, United's midfield still requires attention. Amorim had previously expressed a need for reinforcements and his preferred duo of Casemiro and Fernandes arguably didn't bring out the best in the club captain.",
      "United are reportedly planning to spend money in this month's transfer window, with ex-Wolves star Ruben Neves being identified as a potential target, according to The Guardian. The Al-Hilal midfielder claimed to be valued at £20m, with Neves being one of several players linked with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will hope for more game time under Carrick(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick typically favoured a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, which should allow Fernandes to slot into his preferred attacking role. This would leave Casemiro, Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount as senior midfield options, while young talent Jack Fletcher has also been promoted recently.",
      "Whether Carrick secures a new signing or turns to the club's youth system, finding the right midfield balance will be crucial in United's quest for a Champions League spot. It was a problem his predecessor Amorim failed to resolve, but given Carrick's successful playing career as a defensive midfielder, Carrick should be well-equipped to identify the perfect solution.",

      "Michael Carrick has been named Manchester United's head coach until the end of the season(Image: )",
      "When Ruben Amorim started to go nuclear at Manchester United, Michael Carrick was watching it unfold from a beach in Barbados with former Old Trafford teammates Jonny Evans and Wayne Rooney. The trio and their families were enjoying some New Year sun in the Caribbean, but for two of them, it is the January cold of Carrington that now awaits. Carrick and Evans surely didn't see this coming even two weeks ago. But then not many people at Old Trafford did.",
      "In fact, maybe it was only Amorim who knew what was about to play out as he detonated his reign as United head coach. Club bosses felt they had little choice but to act and director of football Jason Wilcox led the search for a replacement, with the desire to appoint a steady pair of hands until the end of the season.",
      "Although United were mocked for focusing on three former players who had also all had a stint in charge, in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick, the tactic was a deliberate one. The decision to appoint Ralf Rangnick as interim manager in December 2021 was an example of a short-term appointment going wrong, and Wilcox felt that opting for someone with knowledge and understanding of the club would reduce the risk of a head coach needing time to adapt to the club.",
      "Solskjaer was making his interest in a romantic return to Old Trafford clear within hours of the news that Amorim had been sacked. The 52-year-old has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August, and there is a sense of unfinished business for him at United.",
      "His three-year spell in charge defies easy analysis. He delivered Premier League finishes of third and second, albeit in a season behind closed doors, and although the wheels came off at the end, Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Amorim have all struggled since.",
      "But Solskjaer thrust himself forward for this job. He sensed it was his chance to return to a club he loves dearly and to perhaps rehabilitate his own managerial career. He garnered plenty of support from Norway, and half a dozen journalists made the trip to Carrington last Friday for Darren Fletcher's press conference, or to Old Trafford on Sunday for the fixture against Brighton.",
      "Between those dates, Solskjaer met Berrada and Wilcox for face-to-face talks. But by the time the Brighton game kicked off, it was Carrick who had emerged as the chosen candidate. He is eight years Solskjaer's junior and is in the early throes of his career in the dugout. He can be sold as a progressive appointment, while Solskjaer would have always felt a retrograde step.",
      "Carrick met Wilcox and Berrada for the first time last Thursday and made a good impression in the talks. His knowledge of the players was considered a major strength, while his leadership skills and ability to work in the kind of structure now in place at Old Trafford also went down well.",
      "Van Nistelrooy was sounded out as a potential candidate but was discarded by the end of play on Tuesday. Darren Fletcher was informed before his first game as caretaker against Burnley that he would also take the Brighton game, and in every dealing with the media, he was asked what he had been told.",
      "He said the right things, but was never really in contention to stay on beyond the FA Cup tie, whatever the result, although his work last week impressed club officials. There was always a desire to bring in experience, however.",
      "One of the factors against Solskjaer was his previous role at United. He was very much an old-school manager once he landed the job on a permanent basis. He left most of the coaching to his first-team coaches, Kieran McKenna and Carrick.",
      "Although Solskjaer has been more of a tracksuit-wearing boss on the training ground elsewhere, his strengths at United in his first stint were as a motivator and a planner. Now United have a structure that doesn't require many of those skills, and Carrick's stronger pedigree as a coach put him at the head of the queue.",
      "By Sunday night, Carrick had emerged as the unanimous choice amongst the leaders in United's football department, but with Amorim's sacking stripping the coaching staff bare, talk turned to how to build a backroom team.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to build the right profile for his coaching staff. Carrick wanted his former Middlesbrough No.2 Jonathan Woodgate to come with him, while they also approached former England assistant Steve Holland.",
      "Although neither Wilcox nor Carrick had worked with Holland, there was a feeling that his wide-ranging experience and his skill set would be beneficial to the task at hand, with 17 games remaining to rescue the season and secure European qualification.",
      "Interestingly, Carrick's official title is head coach, and not interim head coach. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager in December 2018, and Rangnick was appointed interim manager in November 2021.",
      "Now, United have discarded those temporary titles for Carrick. He only has a contract until the end of the 2025/26 season, but if the next 17 games go well, who knows what comes next? A thorough process to recruit a permanent coach is now underway, and Carrick now has the chance to put himself in the frame.",

      "United's defeat in the FA Cup means they will play just 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years. The club's target for the campaign was to secure European football, but Carrick will attempt to steer United back into the Champions League for next season.",
      "Carrick joins United with the team seventh in the Premier League, three points adrift of fourth."

      "Manchester United players have 17 games left to save their season(Image: )",
      "\"True character reveals itself in difficult times.\" That was the view of Darren Fletcher, who has already been through one season that ended Manchester United careers and is now involved with another.",
      "The 41-year-old was part of the coaching staff when United fell apart under Ralf Rangnick four years ago and although this squad is clearly more unified than that group, Fletcher accepts it could be another season when some players fail the kind of test that Old Trafford offers.",
      "United have fallen at the first hurdle in both cup competitions and will play just 40 games this season. If Michael Carrick is to take charge for the remainder of the season, he has just 17 games in four-and-a-half months. There will be long gaps between games, but as miserable as everything feels right now, Champions League qualification is still a possibility this season.",
      "Fletcher used his press conference after the defeat to Brighton to lay down that challenge to the players, while making it abundantly clear it is up to them to raise themselves as well. If they fail to do so, then it might spell the end for a few.",
      "\"True character reveals itself in difficult times. We learned a lot about a lot of the players in that situation [in 2021/22],\" said Fletcher. \"That will be the same about these lads now. In difficult times, true character is going to show. So they have to dig in, show they want to be part of Manchester United's future, learn from this.",
      "\"And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. Sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Every player should take that advice on board and deliver a run of performances in training and on the pitch that shows the future can belong to them. If United qualify for the Champions League this season, a campaign in danger of being wasted will be salvaged and the future will look brighter.",
      "Whatever happens, there is a group of players who have probably done enough to be part of the club next season. They include summer signings Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, although Cunha is at a point where he needs to raise his game a level or two.",
      "There are also a group of defenders who will stick around. Leny Yoro hasn't had a great season but faith in his ability to be one of Europe's top centre-backs remains high, while Ayden Heaven is clearly one for the future as well. Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez should be safe.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui has been a reliable servant since signing from Bayern Munich and has already shown he has the right character. Luke Shaw is closer to the end than the beginning, but with his contract expiring in 2027, it would make sense to keep him for one more year.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's future should be safe now that Ruben Amorim has departed and Bruno Fernandes should clearly stay, although it feels like that decision will come down to what the captain wants. Amad is another whose future is rock solid.",
      "Beyond that, there are question marks everywhere you look. Tom Heaton, Harry Maguire and Casemiro are out of contract. Maguire might yet earn an extension but there's a chance all three depart. Joshua Zirkzee might survive the January window, but he will be off in the summer, and Altay Bayindir is also likely to want a move. Tyrell Malacia's United career has long been over.",
      "Diogo Dalot might consider himself unfortunate to be on the list, but the 26-year-old has had a disappointing season and at some point it feels like there will be an upgrade at right-back. Patrick Dorgu needs to prove he can hit the heights required of a United player, either at left-back or on the wing.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has rarely looked up to the task since moving from Paris St-Germain and needs a big finish to the season. The same could arguably be true for Mason Mount, who has had a better season but still has question marks around his fitness and the level of his contribution. In a year when the midfield is set for a major revamp, the former Chelsea man is vulnerable.",
      "For all of those players, the next few weeks and months will be a litmus test. It is one they need to pass.",

      "Marcus Rashford is eager to stay at Barcelona beyond the summer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Barcelona have reportedly held talks with Manchester United to assess their options for signing Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal this summer. The 28‑year‑old's loan spell is nearing its end, and the Spanish club are keen to make the move permanent - but there's a catch.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Barcelona are reluctant to activate Rashford's €30million (£26m) buy clause and instead, hope to negotiate a lower fee. It's said that a second loan, potentially with a conditional obligation, has also been discussed as an alternative.",
      "Further discussions are expected to take place closer to the end of the season as both clubs look to find a solution. United are keen to cash in on Rashford and believe the clause is reasonable, while Barcelona hold the advantage of the winger's desire to remain at Camp Nou.",
      "While he may yet get his wish, the La Liga giants are hoping to negotiate a more favourable financial deal before committing to the current buy option. Should an agreement be reached, Rashford would reportedly be offered a contract running until the summer of 2029.",
      "The England international, 28, is expected to take on a bigger role in Catalonia next season if a deal can be reached, especially with Robert Lewandowski, who turns 38 in August, out of contract at the end of the campaign.",
      "Rashford has already made it clear that he wants to remain at the club beyond his loan.",
      "\"Of course what I want is to stay at Barca,\" Rashford said. \"It's an end goal, but it's not the reason why I'm training hard and giving it my best.",
      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford won the Spanish Super Cup with Barcelona(Image: )",
      "Meanwhile, European football expert Andy Brassell has suggested that Rashford is currently the 'most sensible' financial deal available.",
      "\"He's maybe the cheapest financial deal out there,\" he observed. \"They may even loan him for an extra year. He's taken a fair hit on his wages and if United are keen on moving him on permanently and if something can be worked out.",
      "\"It feels like one of the best deals out there for Barcelona because they know he works there already. There's not as much risk as there would be buying a player fresh.",
      "\"I think if they go out there and try and buy someone of Marcus Rashford's quality on the open market, it's going to be a heck of a lot more expensive. We've got to bear in mind as well that next season, they'll probably, almost certainly, have Robert Lewandowski's wages off the books.\"",
      "Rashford has made a strong impact since joining Barcelona, producing seven goals and 11 assists in 27 appearances. However, he has slipped in and out of the starting XI in recent weeks, with Raphinha preferred on the left‑hand side.",
      "On Sunday, Rashford celebrated his first trophy with his teammates as the Catalan giants secured a 3–2 victory over Real Madrid in the Supercopa final in Jeddah.",

I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "United have exercised patience with Lacey, who has struggled with muscle injuries, and the youngster deserves credit for staying determined to reach the first-team despite his progress having stalled.",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",

      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",

      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

      "Manchester United will soon be able to call upon Bryan Mbeumo again(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup at the third round stage having lost 2-1 to fellow Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford.",
      "United, under the watch of interim head coach Darren Fletcher, were hit by goals from Brajan Gruda and former United striker Danny Welbeck either side of half-time. Benjamin Sesko bundled the ball over the line in response, but with 85 minutes gone it was always going to be an uphill struggle to find a way back into the tie.",
      "Shea Lacey was then sent off - shown a second yellow for venting his frustrations with referee Simon Hooper's decision regarding a foul - and the afternoon ended in the ultimate misery of elimination from the cup.",
      "It leaves United, who will name a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim after the season's end, out of both domestic cup competitions, with no European football, and only a top-six Premier League finish to play for.",
      "For that sole purpose Fletcher - or whoever is interim manager for the remainder of the campaign - will want a number of absent players and restore the squad to full strength.",
      "United's injury list has actually depleted in recent weeks, leaving just Matthijs de Ligt the only individual sidelined. In his case this has been due to a back problem since November, though the central defender does not yet have a return date outlined.",
      "Meanwhile, Lacey's red card on Sunday means he will have to serve a one-match suspension. The 18-year-old will miss next weekend's Manchester derby at Old Trafford and only becomes available again for the January 25 trip to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Following on, United have three more absentees who have represented their countries at this year's Africa Cup of Nations since December - Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "The tournament has advanced to the semi-final stages, which are to be played on January 14. Both Amad's Ivory Coast and Mbeumo's Cameroon were eliminated at the quarter-final stage.",
      "It means the two attackers should return and become available for the clash with Manchester City on January 17.",
      "As for Mazraoui, he and AFCON hosts Morocco are part of the last-four and will play Nigeria for a place in the final. Regardless of the outcome, the full-back will only be available for United's meeting with Arsenal on January 25 because the losers of the semi-final will contest a third-place play-off on January 17, with the final scheduled for January 18.",

      "Referee Simon Hooper shows a red card to Shea Lacey in Manchester United's miserable FA Cup exit to Brighton at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Simon Hooper was correct to send off Shea Lacey for his act of dissent during Manchester United's FA Cup third-round elimination at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion, says Keith Hackett, the former head of refereeing body PGMOL.",
      "The 18-year-old had been introduced as one of Darren Fletcher's second-half substitutes and rippled the top of Brighton net shortly before Benjamin Sesko's 85th minute goal brought United back into the cup tie at 2-1 behind.",
      "A full fightback was not to be for the home side, who now only have Premier League football to play for the remainder of the season. Heaping more misery on the FA Cup exit was Lacey's sending off.",
      "The forward had been booked by referee Hooper for the first in the 87th minute for bringing down Yasin Ayari. Two minutes later, he did the same to Ferdi Kadioglu.",
      "Although the second foul was not deemed a second bookable offence itself, Lacey reacted by throwing the ball in anger and this was the action that earned his dismissal.",
      "In review, former PGMOL chief Hackett told Football Insider: \"Simon Hooper is correct in cautioning this rather petulant action which, of course, was a clear act of dissent.",
      "\"Hopefully the player will not do it again,\" he added about the United teenager from Liverpool, who was visibly distraught with the sending off in just his third senior appearance for the club.",
      "Lacey protested Hooper's decision before making his way off the field. He pulled his shirt over his face as he approached the Old Trafford tunnel, and television cameras caught the youngster kicking a wall in further frustration over the incident.",
      "After the dust had settled, the United player took to Instagram to post an apology to the club's supporters. He wrote: \"I want to apologise to all of my teammates staff and the fans [sad pensive face emoji]. I let everybody down tonight I shouldn’t let my emotions get the better of me I will do everything I can to make this right [praying emoji].\"",
      "Lacey will now serve a one-game suspension as a result of receiving two yellow cards in one outing. Because these carry across English domestic competitions, it means he is ruled out of next weekend's Premier League Manchester derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on January 17.",
      "The 18-year-old will next be available for selection for United's trip to the Emirates Stadium, where they will play league leaders Arsenal, on January 25.",

      "Darren Fletcher at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup against Brighton on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United fell at the first hurdle in the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town, and another disappointing defeat against Brighton means they will play just 40 games in all competitions this season.",
      "The Reds came into the game on the back of a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday. There were positives to take from Turf Moor, but Brighton drew first blood at Old Trafford in the first half of the game.",
      "Former United striker Danny Welbeck netted to extend Brighton's advantage. Benjamin Sesko scored with five minutes remaining to give hope of forcing extra time, but Shea Lacey was shown a second yellow card.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "At some point this week, a Manchester United great will ride back into Carrington and look to rescue a season that has hit rock bottom.",
      "Surely it can't get any worse than this. Fans of nostalgia will remember Mick McCarthy's iconic response to a press conference question along similar lines. \"It can,\" came the droll response. They are certainly fans of nostalgia around these parts and it's Manchester City and Arsenal up next.",
      "United's cup endeavours are over for another season, embarrassed by a team from the east coast and humbled by one from the south coast. This is a team all at sea. Darren Fletcher's chances of being the white knight are almost certainly over after his team were beaten by a smarter, slicker and more streetwise Brighton.",
      "Defeat in the FA Cup third round means United will play just 40 games this season and they have lost at the first hurdle in both cup competitions.",
      "This season is turning into an annus horribilis, but then so do most of them at Old Trafford these days. A trawl through the record books is difficult in the search for easy comparisons, but 1981/82 was the last time they went out of both cups at the first hurdle.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: One horrible moment with the ball at his feet in the first half, when he was lucky he wasn't punished. Did at least shrug it off well. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Early miss set the tone. Struggled defensively and got decisions wrong in the final third. Brighton got a lot of joy down United's right. 4",
      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Passing continues to be a major weakness and United need more from their No.6. His days are numbered. 4",
      "Read the full player ratings here.",

      "Casemiro and Maguire ON.",
      "Ugarte and Martinez OFF.",
      "There were positives to take from the Burnley game, but this has been regression from United.",
      "Lacey beats his man down the right and plays a wonderful cross to Sesko in the box. That was oldschool wing player from the youngster. Fans around the press box jumped to their feet to applaud the move.",

      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Fletcher needs to have words during the break because this has been poor. Brighton made six changes to their team today, but they are leading at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes just screamed in frustration as his pass to Sesko failed to be controlled by the centre-forward. There was a little bit too much on it, meaning Sesko had little chance of latching onto the pass.",
      "United’s right side is malfunctioning at the moment. A lot of the play coming over this way, but Dalot been poor and Mount struggling with the width. Kadioglu also really exposing Mount when it comes to running in the other direction. It’s a strength for Brighton at the moment.",
      "United are struggling to build up from the back because Brighton are so well-coached.",
      "Brighton almost played all the way through United from their goalkeeper, but Dorgu recovered to thwart the danger. Dorgu has been in decent form over the last few weeks and has started well again today.",
      "United made a really quick start to the game, creating a handful of chances, but have faded.",
      "That is a disastrous goal to concede for United. The space and overload against Dalot was worked so easily and the marking in the middle was poor as well. They had started so well but that is basic stuff. Lucky not to concede a second with some poor distribution from Lammens. Suddenly rocking here and need to steady the ship. They have to get better defensively.",
      "I'm not sure what was going on down that flank. Brighton were given far too much space and time. Fletcher is watching a replay of the goal alongside Binnion on the bench, trying to work out who was responsible. Mount was pulled out of position and Dalot was left totally exposed.",
      "Brighton have taken the lead through Gruda at the Stretford End.",
      "Fletcher turned around to his bench and shook his head.",

      "It felt like United would start games very passively here under Amorim, there was a strange lack of tempo and intensity, but they’ve come flying out the blocks today. No surprise under a head coach like Fletcher, who had the shackles off on Wednesday, but it has immediately got the crowd into it as well.",
      "Fletcher applauds Mainoo for dropping in between the defenders, picking up the ball from Lammens and turning. Mainoo is brilliant at that - he provides the team with an outlet to play from the back.",
      "Huge chance for Dalot but his finish was tame and straight at Steele.",
      "It was a gorgeous ball from Cunha, who picked the ball up from deep."

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "Michael Carrick has asked the Manchester United hierarchy to sign West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta, according to reports.",
      "Carrick is expected to be announced as United’s interim manager until the end of the season this week and will reportedly be backed with funds in the January transfer window.",
      "United opted to appoint an interim for the remainder of 2025/26 after sacking Ruben Amorim at the beginning of January, with a view to bringing in an elite manager permanently in the summer.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel and Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League-winning head coach Luis Enrique are among the leading candidates to replace Amorim, but it is all about Carrick right now.",
      "The 44-year-old’s sole objective is to get the Red Devils back into the Champions League, with fifth place in the Premier League expected to be enough. United are currently seventh.",
      "There is a decent chance the former United midfielder, who oversaw three games as caretaker boss following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s sacking in November 2021, will have money to spend this month, with a midfielder a top priority.",
      "Al Hilal’s Ruben Neves is reportedly a leading target and is available for as little as £20million, in what would be a no-brainer signing.",
      "However, according to a report from Hooligan Soccer, via a ‘team of five elite reporters’ on X, Carrick’s ‘first transfer request’ is West Ham playmaker Lucas Paqueta.",
      "It has been reported that Paqueta wants to return to Brazil, with Flamengo willing to pay around £30million for the 28-year-old.",
      "Paqueta is said to be so keen on leaving West Ham that he has reportedly agreed personal terms with Flamengo and accepted a pay cut.",
      "He appears to have his heart set on a return to his home country ahead of this summer’s World Cup, but United could yet throw a spanner in the works.",
      "Carrick is reportedly ‘looking to expand his player pool’ and has ‘asked’ the United hierarchy to sign Paqueta from West Ham.",
      "The former Middlesbrough head coach is not expected to have much influence over transfers. No United manager will. An interim certainly will not.",
      "Instead, director of football Jason Wilcox is expected to have the final say on all incoming transfers.",
      "Paqueta was previously linked with a move to Manchester City, but an FA investigation into suspicious betting patterns derailed that transfer and has clearly affected the former Lyon star on a personal level.",
      "A fresh start back home appears to be the perfect solution for Paqueta, rather than stepping into the current chaos at Old Trafford.",
      "That said, the prospect of playing for the biggest club in England could yet tempt him to remain in the Premier League.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League manager rankings: where do Amorim and Maresca land in list of all 28(!) managers?",
      "According to reports, Lucas Paqueta is nearing an exit from West Ham United as he has an ‘agreement’ over a transfer after he ‘asked not to play’.",
      "Lucas Paqueta is not getting any sympathy even from the woke folk while Arsenal fans do not really know how to feel.",
      "Set-pieces and long throws may be trendy but who really gets into football for those? We have the five best open-play Premier League goals of the season.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United target Lucas Paqueta leaving West Ham United is a “concrete possibility” and he is one to watch in the coming weeks.",

      "With an epic season of Managergeddon in full swing, it feels like as good a time as any to dust off the ol’ Premier League Manager Rankings for a quick redo.",
      "There are a great many more managers to include, for one thing, because the last time we did this it was all the way back in October. If you want to know just how far back in the ancient mists of time October was, Andoni Iraola was top of this list, and Thomas Frank was in the top eight with Scott Parker just behind him as he steered Burnley to a position outside the relegation zone.",
      "An awful lot has changed, basically. And if we wait any longer to do this then we’d have to include at least two more managers; Michael Carrick once his return to Man United is rubberstamped, and whoever replaces whichever one of Thomas Frank or Nuno Espirito Santo fails to survive this weekend’s El Sackico between Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "So crack on we must. October’s rankings are in brackets below, with the full majesty of the many thousand words of wrongness here to be enjoyed in full if that’s your bag.",
      "Mate. Just…mate. Possibly the worst managerial reign in the entire history of the Premier League, and that is some shout. It’s certainly the shortest.",
      "Look, we sort of get it, we do. We get why he took the job. He probably did need to move fast to get back in the Premier League, try and convince someone to take a punt on him while those memories of Europa League glory were fresh enough in everyone’s minds to stop them thinking too long or too hard about the sheer ridiculousness of taking Spurs to 17th in the league. He wasn’t to know then that Thomas Frank was treating 17th as his target this season.",
      "It’s asking a huge amount to say Postecoglou should have turned down a job that got him straight back into the European competition where he’d just had such spectacular success.",
      "But…he should have turned down that job. Obviously he should. It went wrong in all the ways everyone knew it would go wrong, except at about five times the pace. There were, even among those truly cataclysmically awful results, flashes of what makes Angeball so beguiling. There were some lovely moves and stunning goals.",
      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",
      "It was always just so obviously asking too much of both Postecoglou and Forest’s players to make such a seismic shift in approach work without any kind of pre-season to bring in the right players and get everyone to understand the process.",
      "Postecoglou will walk away with a nice pay-off for barely a month’s work, but with his reputation in tatters. It is only eight months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",
      "There must have been better options with just a bit more patience. But still we’re kind of glad he did it, because Nuno to Ange to Dyche in barely five weeks is something the like of which will never be seen again.",
      "",
      "Got absolutely none of the help he needed from the club in the summer, which meant all the talk during the late-season struggles last term about not judging Potter until he had his own players and a full pre-season to instil his methods became instantly moot.",
      "But while Potter was not and is not the primary source of West Ham’s travails, let’s also not pretend he is blameless. West Ham didn’t help him, but he didn’t help himself either, and a once-promising career suffered another huge step back.",
      "We’ll admit we didn’t really know how or where the road to recovery might begin for Potter, but will cheerfully admit we didn’t have ‘Simply be almost immediately named manager of Sweden’ high on our list.",
      "That admittedly incredible run of promotions with Ostersund is still evidently highly regarded in a country that has had an absolute catastrof*ck of a World Cup qualifying campaign but one that still has enormous potential for absurd redemption with their Nations League success meaning they need only find a way past Ukraine then Poland or Albania to bag a place in North America despite finishing literally bottom of their qualifying group without a win to their name.",
      "",
      "Now looks utterly doomed to a two-sacking season which, considering what he got up to last season, is just ridiculous really. He was our manager of the year in 2024!",
      "What there is, still, is mitigation. His greatest achievement at Forest might have been in how long he was actually there before the falling out occurred, and West Ham might just be the most impossible job in all of English football.",
      "But he is also one of about 10 managers on this list for whom the old classic ‘not the problem, but also not the solution’ clearly applies.",
      "We’ve never really been able to get past the way, specifically, he approached the game at home against Liverpool. The Hammers were actually something approaching upwardly mobile at that point, with wins by 3-1 and 3-2 scorelines in their two previous home games and a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth. Liverpool were in that bit where they kept losing by three goals for some reason.",
      "Yet Nuno decided this was the time to go full and absolute Nuno instead of sensing the weakness and opportunity. Gunning for a 0-0 draw, he instead got a routine 2-0 defeat.",
      "It might seem silly to pin so much of a relegation-haunted season on a game against Liverpool and maybe it is, but it really does seem like a point at which, well, dreams faded and died.",
      "They’ve managed just three draws and no wins in eight Premier League games since. They’ve lost relegation six-pointers in their last two league games; Nuno surely cannot survive making that three in a row in El Sackico at Spurs this weekend, a misery spectacle of such epic beleaguerment that it is literally impossible to conceive a situation in which both managers survive.",
      "",
      "To be honest, we had The Fear when Wolves followed up that six-game winning run in March and April with four winless games to round out the season. Knowing Wolves’ fondness for letting the end to one season bleed into the next.",
      "We didn’t think it would look quite like this, though, even after they followed that little end-of-season slump with the classic ‘let’s sell lots of good players and not really bother replacing them’ tactic.",
      "Pereira went from hero to zero alarmingly quickly, and it was clear he had no idea how to pull Wolves out of the tailspin in which they found themselves.",
      "A real pity given how well he had them playing at one point last season, but hindsight has not been kind to that six-game winning run, either.",
      "It was, rather brilliantly, the second-longest winning run any Premier League team managed in 2025 (and it was only recently that Aston Villa – not Liverpool or Arsenal or Man City – bettered it) but it was also against three of the very worst relegated sides we’d ever seen as well as West Ham, Man United and Spurs who were all enduring nightmares of their own from which none has yet truly awoken.",
      "So… yeah. Good fun, sure, but also perhaps the single most misleading six-game run in football history.",
      "",
      "Fell out with everyone, which given who that ‘everyone’ is at Nottingham Forest is kind of understandable. But f*ck, what a waste. Didn’t get the chance to follow through on the brilliant work he did last season and was the first manager out of a job in the Premier League this season.",
      "Despite that, his volatile, anger-filled few weeks at Forest are still probably his best weeks of the season. Because his punishment for the end of his Forest reign has been severe indeed. Surely not even Mr Marinakis would have wished the West Ham job on his new worst enemy.",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to them.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",
      "Consider this astonishing guff.",
      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",
      "Now that’s the sort of thing you might normally expect to find written on a toilet wall, but written in sh*t. Or worse, on LinkedIn. Or worse still, on a Jake Humphrey podcast.",
      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that was normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing not aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking his crappy little Arsenal coffees.",
      "What felt like inevitable defeat to an Aston Villa side that has streaked past Spurs in recent seasons means that the drudgery of the league campaign is all that’s realistically left for a forlorn club.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "Vanishing unlikelihoods discarded, and you’re left with a manager brought in to prove that Spurs could compete on multiple fronts now competing on none, and if the upcoming six-pointers at West Ham and Burnley go awry that will swiftly be literally and not just figuratively true",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",
      "",
      "A shiny yet fictional pound on its way to the first reader who can remember the game Wolves’ Under-21 boss was in caretaker charge for. No, you don’t get a pound of any kind for saying it was a defeat.",
      "Chelsea, it was. Lost 3-0. But it did take them until the second half to score, so it was very much not the worst Wolves effort of late 2025.",
      "",
      "Not his fault, of course, but it is just enormously post-2013 Man United that their response to another largely self-inflicted crisis has been to think short and soft before concluding that the answer must again be ‘one of Fergie’s boys’. Except, of course, they’re going one better this time. Now the answer is in fact ‘two of Fergie’s boys’ with Fletcher currently interim for the interim, which at present speed and course appears set to be Michael Carrick rather than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Still time, of course, for them both to get a go as United cheerily write off another season. Even if that season is now sure to be the shortest possible 40-game effort that a Premier League team can ‘enjoy’.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was an astonishing and brilliant one-off. A genuine contender in any conversation around the greatest manager of all time. But he is now an albatross around this club’s neck. They can never hope to replicate even a fraction of his success while they remain in such deferential thrall to his era. Nobody is saying it’s easy to move on from what was two decades of quite ludicrous success. But they really must.",
      "It says much for quite where United now find themselves that Fletcher’s two-game reign, encompassing a league draw against Burnley and FA Cup defeat to Brighton, legitimately contains genuine positives. How far they done fell.",
      "",
      "His greatest achievement at Manchester United will ultimately be the fact he’s found a way to disentangle himself from a cursed club with reputation largely intact.",
      "We’re not even being glib; that’s a stunning achievement that for most of his largely dreadful 14 months in charge seemed entirely impossible.",
      "Yet in the end it was really quite simple and contains a valuable lesson for any other managers who find themselves entirely regretting the life choices they have made that have led them to their current predicament.",
      "Just take on the faceless suits. It really is that easy to get away from any club.",
      "Amorim tried more traditional approaches to getting the tin-tack. Absolute mule-brained stubborn and rigid insistence on his own methods even when they failed again and again. Losing just so very many football matches. Finishing 15th in the Premier League. Losing to Grimsby while p*ssing about with his little magnets. Losing a real-life final to Tottenham, for goodness’ sake.",
      "None of it worked. But mildly suggesting that a random Blackburn winger from the 1990s might not be infallible? Game over.",
      "Amorim’s entire Man United career feels like a modern football parable, and its final act one that should strike a chord with us all. While it may always be the head coach/manager – and Amorim was pretty keen to draw a distinction there as well – who must act as the public face and human shield of any football club it is the silent suits (whether those suits be business or track) who wield the power and yet are nowhere to be seen when trouble is really brewing.",
      "",
      "For very much not the first time, Chelsea have treated an established and improving manager rather shabbily and made a deeply unconvincing subsequent appointment.",
      "This one, of course, comes with the added bonus of multi-club chicanery to make it all feel even more unpleasant. See you this time next year for more such nonsense from the nation’s most beloved football club.",
      "Or, who knows, perhaps even sooner. Even that ‘onwards’ up there feels slightly on the optimistic side.",
      "",
      "Must be cursing that the deeply complicated back-and-forth and complex negotiations required to extract Liam Rosenior from Strasbourg meant he was also in charge for the shambolic 2-1 defeat at Fulham rather than just the eerily competent 1-1 draw at Manchester City.",
      "",
      "The initial and inevitable improvement from the Postecoglou silliness has now faded rather dramatically. The new-manager bounce has, as new-manager bounces are wont to do, run out of energy.",
      "But the fact it still contained just enough oomph to tease out a win at an entirely oomph-free West Ham feels significant.",
      "A full-blooded relegation scrap remains possible but for now unlikely, and we’re not sure even Mr Marinakis, chaotic bundle of main character and arch villain energy that he is, can really be arsed with another sacrifice at this time.",
      "And who knows, there might still be genuine glory at the end of it all. Dyche succeeding Postecoglou as Europa League champion as well as Nottingham Forest manager has an undeniable deliciousness to it.",
      "",
      "Doing almost precisely the job you might have expected at this point after a vaguely encouraging start. It’s not been horrendous, but it’s not remotely looking like it might actually keep Burnley up either.",
      "His immediate future rests on whether the club think a) attempting a meaningful fight against relegation this season from this point is realistic and, if not, then b) whether Parker is the right man to keep them in this relegation-promotion time loop next season.",
      "The longer he remains in place working to his current level the more it looks like the answer to a) is ‘Probably not’ and b) is ‘Probably yes’. But at some point surely everyone involved gets a bit bored of it all, no?",

      "The top of the current Premier League Sack Race betting is pretty interesting.",

One is in the middle of relegating a team that has been a Premier League club in all but four of its season, and the other is desperately trying to do the same with an ever-present Premier League club while chatting awful and appalling sh*t about fences and windmills while sipping coffee from a cup featuring the badge of their bitterest and most successful rivals.",

      "As far as Liverpool as a collective go, our current working theory is that fourth is about right. That they have, over the course of the season, played the fourth-best (or, if one were so inclined, 17th least bad) football of any Premier League club this season.",
      "There are two things to note about that. One, it’s still not really good enough. Not when so much has been spent on theoretically improving a team and squad that last season were very much number one.",
      "And two, that broadly and despite the obvious results-driven narratives with which we all inevitably operate, their level hasn’t really fluctuated that much. They’ve been okay but not great pretty much all season.",
      "It’s just that at the start of the season that okay-but-not-great manifested itself in a string of absurd and unlikely late wins, and then after that for ages and ages a run of equally absurd – and also again often quite late – defeats.",
      "Their results remains absurdly streaky. They won their first five league games, then lost six of the next seven, then won four of the next six and have now drawn three in a row. We really don’t think there’s a particularly convincing case to be made that the actual standard of their play was conspicuously better or worse at any time in that run.",
      "Apart, possibly, from the 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United in which the sheer scale of their headloss and panic was genuinely alarming. That was a game in which they spent the entire second half in 94th-minute goal-chasing mode.",
      "And that’s where Slot comes in. He really hasn’t handled the slings and arrows of Our League’s outrageous fortune particularly well this season. And that’s in marked contrast to the cool, level-headed way in which he spent last season merely polishing some of the rough edges off Jurgen Klopp’s heavy-metalers with such devastingly profound effect.",
      "This season just seems to have rattled him entirely. As ever with any discussion of Liverpool this season, it feels unfair not to at least acknowledge the unique and harrowing circumstances in which they found themselves following the death of Diogo Jota. There is ample mitigation for heads not being right anywhere in the club.",
      "But at some point the manager needs to be in charge. To take charge. It was the most impressive thing about Slot’s first season at Anfield. The seemingly gargantuan, arguably impossible, job of carrying enough authority with what was, famously almost exclusively, Jurgen Klopp’s old squad was handled with such casual aplomb.",
      "Yet now, with a Liverpool squad far more his own, he seems to have less authority and control than ever. This feels like a season that is simply happening to Liverpool, and happening to Slot.",
      "Slot’s failure to treat the twin imposters of triumph and disaster just the same in those early months of the season really do feel more and more like tone-setters for the uncertainty of what was to come.",
      "Let’s be honest, we all got carried away with both the start Liverpool’s reigning champions made and the collapse that followed. But we’re not all Liverpool’s actual manager. He’s not supposed to get as lost in the noise as the rest of us. He’s not supposed to basically accuse Man United of cheating because they deployed the darkest art in the game: squad rotation.",
      "He’s supposed to be above that. And now we must face the baffling but entirely real possibility that he could become the third Big Six manager this season to be outlasted by windmilling Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Another Big Six manager who paid the price (or got his escape, depending on your perspective) for off-field disagreements rather than on-field performance.",
      "We haven’t ever, in truth, been entirely convinced by Maresca as an elite coach. But he also probably did do just about everything and more that could reasonably be asked of anyone working under the unique weirdness that is BlueCo’s Chelsea, where you are less a football coach and more a layer of middle-management bureaucracy in a vast and inscrutable player-trading empire.",
      "We were even more frustrated this season than we were last with the way he self-fulfillingly talked Chelsea out of the title race, but we also understand what he was driving at. It must be immensely frustrating to try and work as Chelsea’s head coach, a job where the thing that is in many ways the biggest hindrance to performing to the best of your ability is also the very thing that means you won’t get the full credit if and when it does go well.",
      "“Oh, anyone could succeed when they get half-a-billion quid to spend!” is a pretty compelling argument. But only if you as the coach get that half-a-billion quid to spend on the specific talents and player profile you need or want to try and drive on-field success. Not so much when that money is instead being buried on players that a spreadsheet suggests have the greatest potential for future profit.",
      "It’s not even that BlueCo are wrong, in their own grim way. Chelsea’s sales sheet tells you this is a wild and unscrupulous but undeniably feasible way to run a business. It’s just surely not a great way to build a football team.",
      "And we very strongly suspect Maresca’s work in keeping the whole show on the road over the last 18 months is about to look far, far better in hindsight then it ever really did at the time.",
      "",
      "Inherited a shambles, obviously, but the good news with that is the only way is up. Or at least no further down.",
      "The first seven games, which all ended in defeat, did provide some challenge to that notion. But did also offer occasional hints at progress. The 2-1 defeats at both Arsenal and Liverpool were not those of a club with two points from half a season.",
      "And now look at them. Five points from three games and a nice big FA Cup win against lower-league opposition might not seem much, but it is a veritable feast compared to the famine that preceded it.",
      "They probably will still go down, like, but they do now at least appear set to a) beat Derby’s infamous all-time low and b) potentially chuck some spanners in some works for others elsewhere along the way.",
      "It’s not much. It’s a lot more than looked possible a month ago.",
      "",
      "Slightly odd team, are Everton. Often feels like they’re right on the brink of breaking out into being really quite good and really quite fun, but then they… don’t. And, we slightly hate ourselves for this conclusion, but can’t help it: Moyes, that.",
      "He’s not doing a bad job, obviously, because Everton are not in mortal relegation peril and that has been the general pre-Moyes vibe in recent seasons. There is further mitigation in the initial growing pains that come with any move to a new stadium and the loss of familiarity and atmosphere that is all but unavoidable.",
      "Above all else for anyone thinking of aiming any serious criticism Moyes’ way at all is the extreme cautionary tale that West Ham have become since his departure.",
      "We still maintain that Hammers fans’ desire for more than the perfunctory survival football he was offering by the end was perfectly understandable, but bloody hell.",
      "So yes, maybe Everton do for now still have to be careful what they wish for. But at the same time it is now just one win in seven games for the Toffees, including some markedly insipid efforts against Burnley and Brentford and Wolves and a third-round FA Cup exit that confirms the extension of what is now one of the league’s most eye-catching and embarrassing barren runs will continue into a 32nd year.",
      "",
      "It was October 22 when we declared Iraola the best manager of the first two months of the Premier League season. Four days later they eased to victory over Nottingham Forest – their fifth win in eight games after an opening-day defeat at Liverpool – to move second in the table.",
      "Then simply didn’t bother winning any of their next 11 games in the league before a desperately needed visit from Dr Tottenham. Tottenham, for what it’s worth, were just a point below Bournemouth in third at the end of October.",
      "We do hold our hands up when we get things wrong here. Usually because we have no choice and are bang to rights. But this time we don’t think this is an egregious f*ck-up on our part.",
      "Given the players they’d lost in the summer, what Iraola appeared to be doing two months into the season really was extraordinary and we stand by our assessment.",
      "Such was the strife of the summer that even after that 11-game winless run nobody could really say Bournemouth were in a place wildly different to pre-season expectations. Even now he still gets a passing grade for having them just about clear of the stickiest relegation soup.",
      "But for Iraola himself, if he harbours – as we assume he does – loftier ambitions somewhere down the line then he really does need to sort out this idiosyncratic penchant for absurd alternating streaks of brilliant and terrible results.",
      "There are obvious examples within this very league this season of just how much harder it is to conceal those flaws once you’re at one of the clubs where the spotlight is more harsh.",
      "",
      "Look, overall he’s still doing extraordinary things isn’t he? Nobody’s disputing that about a man who delivered Crystal Palace’s first ever silverware and some absurd above-weight-punching all round.",
      "But… coming to an end, isn’t it? Definite ‘far as I can take them’ vibes coming off the place now, and there’s a bit of a funk developing. Let’s not any of us pretend that becoming the first top-flight side to ever lose an FA Cup game to a sixth-tier one was something we expected; but the idea of Palace getting into some kind of strife at Macclesfield on their first return to the competition since lifting the trophy was very easy to picture.",
      "In all, across four competitions, it’s now nine games without a win over the last month or so. They’ve gone out of both domestic cups in that time, and have made hard work of the Conference League where they must now come through a play-off against European heavyweights Sigma Olomouc or Zrinjski Mostar just to reach the last 16.",
      "Most damningly of all, that winless run even includes defeat at the hands of the good doctor after a really quite pitiful non-performance in a 1-0 home defeat to Spurs.",
      "It’s a real shame because it’s been quite a ride, but it just all feels like it’s over. That’s reality for clubs like Palace, who always knew they wouldn’t have Glasner forever. But it still seems to us like it didn’t absolutely have to peter out quite so meekly as this.",
      "",
      "The FA Cup win at Man United feels like a significant one for Hurzeler and co, bringing interest back to a season that had grown in real danger of aimless drift after a run of one win in eight Premier League games dragged them right back to the very middle of the great mid-table morass.",
      "Absolutely nothing wrong with steering Brighton to comfy mid-table, of course, and the sheer size of that mid-table this season has led to Hurzeler having a slight under-the-radar feel. There is not for him the same links to ‘bigger’ jobs that we saw in Roberto De Zerbi’s time or that you get now with your Glasners and your Silvas and the Iraolas of this world.",
      "Which is odd, really, because Brighton do have a pretty eye-catching way of going about their incessant mid-tabling, always seemingly equally happy to be pulling down the pants of the biggest boys – four points this season off Man City, for instance – as they are donating cheap points to helpless lost causes like West Ham or Wolves or Spurs.",
      "",
      "When you’ve set the standards Guardiola has set, it doesn’t take much to look like failure. And two seasons without a meaningful title challenge, which now seems likely after a damaging run of quite silly draws, would constitute that.",
      "The most alarming element of it all is that City have come unstuck at what looked like the precise moment they would in fact strike. They’d reeled Arsenal in, cutting the lead to just two points somehow, and looked poised to make life extremely uncomfortable for a team that had seen it all before.",
      "Instead, they’ve failed to beat Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton – the latter two setbacks worsened by coming at home in games where they led. Just not very City and not very Guardiola to be letting anyone – either in those matches specifically or their wider league context – off the hook like that.",
      "We keep swinging one way then the other with Guardiola this season. Sometimes we think he’s reinvigorated by the challenge of building a new team and at others we think he won’t last the season without doing a Klopp.",
      "Our internal Guardiola swingometer is once again headed in that direction.",
      "",
      "We really did worry that either he or Fulham were going to do something very silly they would both regret when the ever-tempting sack window of the November international break arrived with Fulham in something approaching doldrum status after a fairly miserable defeat at Silva’s former club Everton.",
      "Happily, six wins and two draws from their subsequent 10 Premier League games have put all that silly talk to bed and lifted Fulham right back to their correct and proper place in the middle of the pack, vying once again with Brighton for the crown of the Premier League’s most mid-table club in what is looking like the Premier League’s most mid-table season.",
      "Obviously the risk now is that he has, if anything, gone too far the other way. He’s almost, for me, Clive, now managing Fulham too well. Because with that comes the danger that he finds himself doing something really stupid like taking the Tottenham job.",
      "Everyone must resist. Fulham and Silva is just one of those rare and precious club-manager combos where no good can come for anyone if it is set asunder.",
      "",
      "A man with a famously excellent record of marching teams into the Premier League in glorious fashion and then meekly steering them immediately back whence they came has, at last, hit upon a formula for bucking that trend.",
      "It’s a fine effort and well worth remembering now just how unlikely it all looked as recently as November. Leeds had lost three in a row and were 2-0 down at Man City at half-time, and it looked like another textbook Farke promotion-and-despair one-two punch.",
      "But while the unlikely second-half fightback in that game cruelly didn’t deliver actual points it did instil belief and confidence.",
      "Leeds have been an entirely different prospect since that day. They’ve beaten Chelsea, drawn twice with Liverpool and hammered Crystal Palace in a seven-game unbeaten run that only ended with an instant classic of a game at Newcastle that could have finished with just about any scoreline but was, unluckily for Farke and Leeds, 4-3 to the home side when the music stopped.",
      "Absolutely no reason that performance should derail what Leeds have going on right now, and they were impressive again in sidestepping a potential FA Cup banana skin at Derby on a weekend when others were far more careless.",
      "",
      "That he and Newcastle now find themselves sixth in the league after what has, for the most part, been a difficult and challenging campaign says perhaps more about this season’s Premier League than it does specifically about Newcastle.",
      "The entire mid-table area, in which nine points separates 12 teams from fourth-placed Liverpool to Bournemouth in 15th, is built to deceive and hoodwink. Find yourself 13th one weekend and it can feel like the sky is falling in.",
      "But win a few games against Burnley, Palace and Leeds and suddenly all is right again. The humdrum reality, of course, is that unless there’s something truly compellingly obvious for good or bad, then caution must be advised about getting over-excited in either direction.",
      "We can all see with our eyes that Brentford are performing wonderfully well, for instance, or that Spurs are f*cking rancid. With Newcastle, though, they weren’t really terrible when they were 14th and they aren’t suddenly great now they’re sixth.",
      "But maybe that’s the point. This is not a season when greatness is a necessity for great things to happen. And for both Howe and Newcastle, for all the difficulties they’ve faced in the transfer market and with injuries and noise, great things remain entirely possible in multiple ways.",
      "They’re back in the Champions League hunt via the league, and they’re going to be in at least the play-offs of this season’s competition, all while remaining active players in both domestic cups.",
      "It’s not been a straightforward season for club or manager, but it absolutely could still be a generational one. Or they might crash out of everything and wind up 11th. That’s part of what makes it all so exciting. There aren’t many others who are crossing the midway point of the season with quite such a wide range of potential outcomes as Howe and his team.",
      "",
      "In the summer, Brentford lost their inspirational manager, the fourth and sixth leading goalscorers in the 24/25 league season (with a mere 39 goals between them), their captain, and their goalkeeper.",
      "They replaced these individuals with their set-piece coach, Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth, some spare parts from here and there, and a Reiss Nelson.",
      "They are fifth in the Premier League. Now even allowing for the congested bunching-up of all the teams who aren’t either challenging for the title or desperately fighting relegation, that’s ridiculous.",
      "We don’t trust Keith Andrews, but we do fear and respect him because we can only conclude some ungodly and dark magic is involved here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland are actually now without a Premier League win in five games. Nobody has noticed this because a) they’re still doing tremendously well, obviously, and more importantly b) they still drew four of them.",
      "The amusing reality is that during this sticky spell since the derby-day win over Newcastle they have still extended their lead over each and every member of the current bottom four.",
      "In summary, then: even when things have been as bad as they been all season for Sunderland, when they have been shorn of their AFCON stars and bedevilled by injuries, Regis Le Bris and the gang are still comfortably exceeding, even in that specific run, any and all pre-season expectations.",
      "If you find yourselves, as a promoted club, in a situation where you can have a bad run and slip all the way down to 10th in the table, then things really are going tremendously well.",
      "",
      "The starkest of all reminders that October was f*cking ages ago. Back then, Emery and Villa were still making their first tentative steps in turning round a miserable start to the season, one that felt full of hangovers and regrets and disappointment at the way 2024/25 had finished on the final day at Old Trafford.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League by cruel and fine margins had felt like a significant sliding doors moment for Emery and Villa, and a difficult summer and even worse start to the new campaign left the unmistakable sense of something wonderful coming to its end without ever really hitting the heights it might have done.",
      "Then Villa – and we really don’t understand why more managers and teams don’t adopt such a policy – simply set about winning all of the football matches.",
      "After no wins and just a single goal in their first five league matches of the season, Villa won 12 of the next 13. Even after a recent ‘slump’ that comprises a defeat at champions-elect Arsenal and goalless draw at Crystal Palace, they remain level on points with City and miles clear of any undignified squabbly scramble for a Champions League finish.",
      "Add in routine FA Cup progress at Spurs, who they have for now overtaken entirely, and serene progress through the very winnable Europa League and this now longer feels anything like something coming to a premature end.",
      "It really might only just be getting started.",
      "",
      "Still as odd as socks, but he has built a champion Arsenal team that, for the first time since The Invincibles, combines both the talent to win the league with the minerals.",
      "There was a good deal of guff after the defeat at Villa, with a large amount read into the body language of the players after conceding the late winner.",
      "Now a lot of that is because it is always and undeniably funny to watch grown adult men have full limb-thrashing toddler tantrums more akin to a three-year-old denied sweets in Tesco. But a lot of it was along more faux-concerned ‘hope not, hope not’ lines about what it indicated about their mental state and preparedness for the battle ahead.",
      "Now it’s true that Arsenal weren’t good in their next match either, and were pretty lucky it was against Wolves. But they did still manage to win it. And then the next four after that. And then draw with Liverpool to preserve what had by then grown into a six-point lead at the top of the table.",
      "We’re not saying Arteta suddenly has a gang of mentality monsters on his hands. But they’re not about to do anything that even the internet can dress up as a bottling, and just as importantly nobody now looks remotely equipped to place them under the kind of pressure that might test that new-found steel in any meaningful way.",
      "They will win the league, they will thoroughly deserve to win the league, and the fact they’ll have done it after signing a ‘missing piece of the puzzle’ striker who is absolutely sh*tbone awful is only more impressive, in a way.",
      "Whether it’s vindication for absolutely all of Arteta’s various eccentricities we’re not so sure. But it will absolutely prove what has been obvious for some time now behind all the banters and whimsy. He is very, very good at this job.",

      "The appointment of Michael Carrick as interim manager at Old Trafford has been greeted with the same indifference that provided the backdrop to the week-long race to the hot seat. Carrick emerged the winner, beating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in what was largely a toss-up with a double-sided coin.",
      "However United came to the decision, it is perhaps the best of the two outcomes. It could be viewed as a triumph for tactics over vibes. Which might be a step forward; it really is hard to tell at Manchester United.",
      "And that wait in itself could become a problem for Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and whoever else calls the shots at Old Trafford these days. While they are doubtless backslapping each other right now – well done, boys, good process – the fear lingers that the board have set themselves up for another fall.",
      "Because there is a chance that Carrick succeeds. What then?",
      "United’s stated aim at the start of this season was a return to the Champions League and, perhaps more because of the ineptitude of others than anything they themselves are doing right, that remains a realistic goal.",
      "It is likely England will have five teams in the Champions League next season. Carrick and his coaching staff walked into Carrington to take over a side one point off fifth in the Premier League with – woefully, but handily – absolutely no distractions whatsoever.",
      "If Carrick drags United back to the top table of European football for 2026/27 while stirring Stretford End sentiment, it would not be an unreasonable expectation of the interim boss to have his title changed to something a little more permanent.",

      "We could find out in May. The fear must be that this United board will simply kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way before gathering the day after the end of the season to thrash out the way forward. Europe beckons? Carry on, Carrick.",
      "But if United want to be taken seriously again, then Ratcliffe, Wilcox and Berrada have to get serious themselves – and decisive. Carrick may fulfil his brief but the board must still use the time bought by his interim appointment to identify a coach with serious credentials, then lure them to Old Trafford and do whatever preparation necessary for the next manager to hit the ground running.",

      "“You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and, as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final.",
      "“No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically, the club met with Carlo shortly before his [Sir Alex Ferguson’s] retirement in 2013 and we could have short-circuited this entire process, starting with him at the beginning of the cycle.",
      "“But, by that stage, he was close to agreeing to joining Real Madrid for his first spell in charge and so what might have been a perfect appointment never happened.”",

      "“If not, Thomas Tuchel is the outstanding candidate.”",
      "Outlining the four key criteria for any new Man Utd manager, Neville added: “You have to be able to handle the media and the noise which comes with this club. It is what it is so get over it and deal with it. It’s why you’re getting paid the big bucks.",
      "“You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "“You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it’s different to competing in many of the European leagues.",
      "“You also have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1 / 4-2-3-1.”",

      "According to respected reporter David Ornstein, Manchester United have ‘reached an agreement’ with Michael Carrick over becoming their new interim manager.",
      "In recent days, Man Utd legend and former Middlesbrough manager Carrick has overtaken Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to become the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "It has been a week since the Red Devils parted company with Amorim, who is set to be replaced by an interim boss until the summer. At the end of this season, the Premier League giants will look to appoint a more established boss to oversee a long-term rebuild.",

      "TalkSPORT have since revealed that ‘legendary former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson recommended Carrick over Solskjaer’.",
      "The same report has provided insight into who will be part of Carrick’s coaching team.",
      "They explained: ‘Carrick wants [Darren Fletcher] to be on his coaching staff as well as Jonny Evans, who worked as Fletcher’s right-hand man for the FA Cup defeat as well as a draw to Burnley in the Premier League last week.",

      "Carrick will no doubt be relishing a return to Man Utd, but former defender Paul Parker has warned him that he could be ‘ridiculed for life’.",
      "Parker said: “From now and until the end of the season will be a nightmare. It is a big worry that the caretaker will have to be there for almost half a season.",
      "“But on the other hand, who wants the job right now at Man United? Almost no one. It is very interesting, because in the ideal world the next manager should be thinking about what he could become. He can become the next Sir Alex Ferguson.",

      "The latest information is that Carrick has overtaken Solskjaer in the running to replace Amorim, with Man Utd looking to have a new manager in the dugout in time for Saturday’s Manchester derby against Manchester City.",
      "READ: Is everybody still ‘thronging around’ Darren Fletcher after that defeat?",
      "On Monday morning, a report from The Athletic’s Laurie Whitwell revealed: ‘Carrick has emerged as the leading candidate after he and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer held face-to-face talks with club executives. Darren Fletcher, in caretaker charge for two games following Ruben Amorim’s sacking, is in line to potentially assist Carrick as a coach. It is thought another coach coming in to support Carrick would also be on the cards.",
      "‘United insist no final decision has been made, but an announcement is anticipated in the next 48 hours. Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada have led the process to appoint an interim head coach, with sign off required by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family.’",
      "Now, The Daily Mail‘s Chris Wheeler has provided more information on the Man Utd manager situation, confirming that Carrick is currently the ‘frontunner’ over Solskjaer.",
      "While Solskjaer is not yet ‘ruled out’, there are said to be two factors behind Man Utd’s decision to favour Carrick.",
      "Wheeler explained:",
      "‘As well as impressing Berrada and Wilcox, the 44-year-old is said to have support from within the dressing-room from the players who worked with him when he was part of the coaching staff under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, before taking caretaker charge of games against Villarreal, Chelsea and Arsenal in the 2021-22 season.’",
      "It has also been suggested that there could be an appointment as early as Monday and this report claims that ‘could be’ the case, but ‘sources believe the process may take longer’.",
      "Man Utd’s board must use the time bought by hiring Michael Carrick to find a serious coach, rather than wait for the interim manager to back them into a corner ...",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘decision’ on whether to keep Darren Fletcher as part of Michael Carrick’s coaching team.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney insists he would accept an invitation from Michael Carrick to become part of his coaching staff at Old Trafford.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "According to respected reporter David Ornstein, Manchester United have ‘reached an agreement’ with Michael Carrick over becoming their new interim manager.",
      "Man Utd have chosen tactics over vibes but are treading familiar ground with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who will reportedly join this week."

      "Manchester United’s worst fears appear to have been realised when it comes to the capture of primary midfield target Elliot Anderson, with sources telling TEAMtalk that bitter rivals Manchester City have already ‘made contact’ over a big-money deal.",
      "The Premier League’s transfer mill is heating up once again, with Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson firmly at the centre of intense speculation ahead of the summer window.",
      "As the winter window looks like it could end without a move for the 23-year-old England international, attention has shifted to what could become one of the most hotly-contested deals of the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "Multiple sources indicate that Man City are preparing a strong push for Anderson’s signature, with manager Pep Guardiola said to be a major admirer of the versatile central midfielder. Indeed, my colleague Dean Jones recently detailed City’s firm interest in the player just last week.",
      "City’s recruitment team, including director of football Hugo Viana, has closely monitored Anderson’s progress at the City Ground, where he has established himself as a key figure.",
      "Indeed, insiders suggest Guardiola views Anderson as an ideal fit for his tactical system – capable of operating as a deep-lying playmaker or box-to-box No. 8 – with the technical quality and composure to thrive in high-possession environments.",
      "Sources close to the situation reveal that City have already made contact with Anderson’s representatives, signalling their intent to formalise interest when the summer market opens.",
      "This has sparked significant concern among rival suitors, particularly Man Utd, who have identified the former Newcastle United academy product as a top option in their planned midfield overhaul.",
      "Indeed, United are targeting multiple reinforcements in the engine room, with Anderson high on the list alongside Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "United’s anxiety stems from City’s perceived advantages: their proven track record of success, Champions League pedigree, and the allure of working under one of football’s most respected tacticians.",
      "Some sources even claim Anderson himself is keen on a move to the Etihad, with whispers that he sees no better opportunity to elevate his career. This has led to assessments from rival clubs that, should City submit a competitive bid, they would enter as clear favourites.",
      "Nottingham Forest, however, hold a strong hand.",
      "Anderson is tied to a long-term contract until 2029, giving the club leverage to demand a substantial fee. Valuations range from £80million to over £100m, with some sources suggesting the price could climb further if Anderson shines for England at the upcoming World Cup.",
      "Forest have repeatedly stated no interest in selling in January, emphasising their desire to retain key assets amid their push for a stable Premier League position.",
      "Other clubs, including Chelsea and Bayern Munich, remain in the conversation, but the narrative increasingly frames this as a potential City-United showdown. With City’s midfield requiring fresh legs to complement stars like Rodri (as he returns to full fitness), Anderson represents a strategic long-term investment.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are still absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in nine games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",

      "Darren Fletcher was unable to part the dark clouds above Old Trafford, but the interim-interim manager has achieved some little victories, if no actual wins…",
      "Fletcher is reporting to Carrington on Monday morning to hear what Manchester United have in mind for the rest of the season. Reports suggest Michael Carrick has emerged as most likely to take over.",
      "He may not have won any games, losing to Brighton after a draw at Burnley, but Fletcher’s brief reign wasn’t a dead loss. There were some positives to take despite the bleak overall outlook.",
      "Handily for features like these, we’ve counted five…",
      "",
      "Mainoo v Amorim was in danger of becoming 2026’s Pogba v Mourinho, especially while the midfielder’s idiot half-brother was hellbent on milking his sibling’s exile for all the attention he could.",
      "Still, it was very clear that if Amorim remained in charge, Mainoo was finished. The manager did not trust the England star to play at the base of his midfield and he was way down the pecking order for the more advanced positions. A parting seemed inevitable…another academy product sold off and most likely to go and be a huge success elsewhere.",
      "But Amorim’s exit makes that prospect far more remote. There is a role for Mainoo in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, but the 20-year-old still has plenty to prove after almost a lost year.",
      "Upon returning from injury for the first post-Amorim game – convenient timing, that – Fletcher has given Mainoo the platform to build upon for the remainder of a season that may be all-but finished for the club, but the next 17 games are crucial for the player.",
      "",
      "Funny though it would have been to see Fletcher stick with a back three after Amorim, the interim-interim boss was never going to pass up the easiest win imaginable by reverting to a back four.",
      "Not only to highlight a contrast between himself and Amorim; a back four simply suits the players at his disposal despite the previous manager’s desperate attempts to shoehorn them into a 3-4-2-1.",
      "Especially the full-backs. Had Amorim stayed, United would have needed at least one, probably two new wing-backs. Literally all those who have played in the position over the last year are more comfortable as full-backs.",
      "It times of struggle, it is always easiest to revert to what comes natural and we would be stunned if any of United’s defenders have grown up more used to a three than a four. These Red Devils evidently don’t catch on quick (ask Ralf Rangnick), so it makes complete sense to simplify things, and the principles of defending in a back four are less taxing on the brain.",
      "All they need to do now is remember the basics of marking and closing down. One step at a time…",
      "MORE: Michael Carrick next? Man Utd have snubbed one of six best caretaker managers",
      "",
      "Another easy win, especially at Old Trafford, can usually be achieved by throwing in a kid. Fletcher resisted the temptation to do that with his sons but threw in Lacey, an 18-year-old who has been tearing it up in the academy.",
      "That is not to say that Fletcher promoted Lacey ahead of time for his own ends; the teenager has earned his promotion. But Fletcher has clearly been more willing than Amorim to facilitate it.",
      "Coming off the right flank, Lacey was bright against Burnley, almost scoring a stunner with his first senior touches, and against Brighton, it was evident his senior team-mates trust him. Of course, his two yellow cards were stupid and United have to hope it serves as a steep learning curve. But Lacey has whetted the appetite for more cameos through the remainder of the season.",
      "To ham up his association with the academy and all that represents at United, Fletcher could have included 15-year-old JJ Gabriel in his squad for Brighton. That he didn’t is a positive. At least let the lad finish school before throwing him into the circus ring.",
      "",
      "Sesko has been a tough watch since he arrived from RB Leipzig for around £70million in the summer. He’s certainly not the only big money striker to arrive from abroad and take some time to settle, but the Slovenian’s confidence appeared to be draining to dangerously low levels.",
      "That’ll happen when you don’t see the ball. Granted, there have been times when it has been slung his way and he’s been shrugged off it too easily for a lad of 6’5″, but far too much of his involvement in United’s play was far too far from the opposition goal.",
      "That seemed to change against Burnley. Not only did he score twice, doubling his tally through the first 16 games in one night, but there was undeniably a greater emphasis on finding Sesko around the box. His two goals came as a result of seven shots on target – the most any player has managed in a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Another goal though ultimately inconsequential followed against Brighton, with his three goals all different finishes: a first-time volley to meet a cross; a one-v-one after a run in behind; and a header from a set-piece.",
      "Whoever comes in needs to make sure Sesko retains a similar supply line that Fletcher has laid for the centre-forward.",
      "",
      "United’s search for a new manager is obviously their most pressing business. But their skipper’s situation needs plenty of attention too.",
      "Reports suggest he’s had enough of United’s s*** and fancies getting away in the summer. You cannot blame him. Fernandes has been brilliant for United since he came through door in 2020 and perhaps only after he leaves will his contribution be truly appreciated by some.",
      "From United’s perspective, hopefully there is still time to show Fernandes that it doesn’t have to be this bleak because literally no one would trust the club to replace his record-breaking creativity – he’s created double the number of chances of any other United player – in a summer when they are preoccupied with a manager.",
      "On that, Fletcher has made a positive start simply by playing Fernandes in a position closer to his best. Under Amorim, he had to play at the base of the midfield and he made a decent fist of things. But United – and Sesko – need him closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Against Brighton and Burnley (he played only an hour upon return from injury) in attacking midfield positions, Fernandes created five chances in each game, above his season average of 3.3 per 90. At Turf Moor, his withdrawal and United’s loss of control was no coincidence.",
      "If United are to salvage something from this shipwreck of a season, it can only happen if Fernandes is flourishing further up the pitch.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 19:42, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions."

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup meaning they will only play 40 games this season; with the club out of both domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle and a league title highly unlikely this term - where do the managerless club go this season?",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 07:50, UK",
      "No manager, no trophy hopes, no noise. The final whistle against Brighton was met with a few boos, then stunned silence. Just where do Manchester United go from here?",
      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",

      "Fletcher confirmed after the 2-2 draw with Burnley that he will stay on in the role to cover the Brighton game, which has bought director of football Jason Wilcox some more time to interview other candidates.",
      "Ruud Van Nistelrooy remains an option for the interim role, but - in contrast to Solskjaer and Carrick - he is well-known to the current Old Trafford regime, and so does not require the same level of interview scrutiny.",
      "\"They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge 10 years ago, then Ole came in charge and you go back to the old boys, then you go for a new one, then you go for more experience.",
      "\"It is almost like a cycle, like a movie we have all seen before and Groundhog Day.",
      "\"What I do think is Ole is someone who absolutely loves the club, he knows the job, he has been in the job.",
      "\"The other names that have been mentioned - Michael Carrick, Ruud van Nistelrooy - these are really fantastic people.",
      "\"I trained with those guys for a lot of years. They love the club intensely, they get the club, but still they are going to come under a lot of pressure in this next four or five months if results don't go their way and they are going to have to be ready for that.",
      "\"Whoever is going to get it out of those three who are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it is a tough role.\"",
      "As talks continue for an interim boss, among those linked with the permanent role are Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and Newcastle's Eddie Howe.",
      "Glasner has six months left on his deal at Selhurst Park but shut down any talk of the position during a press conference earlier this week.",
      "\"I am Crystal Palace manager. It's wasted time for you to ask any more questions. I don't talk about any other club other than Crystal Palace,\" he said.",
      "Howe, meanwhile, also reiterated his commitment to Newcastle.",
      "\"I'm 100 per cent here, working as hard as I can, head down, ignoring all the stuff that you guys write, good or bad, because it's irrelevant,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about today's work and trying to prepare the team as well as we can for Leeds [on Wednesday], so that will never change from my perspective, my commitment to my work and my job.",
      "\"As long as I'm happy and able to express myself in the best way that I can to help the team, nothing will change.\"",
      "Asked if there was anything which could tempt him away from St James' Park, Howe replied: \"No, not at this current time.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club.",
      "\"But, at the moment, I am very happy.\"",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Had Shea Lacey's late strike found the net rather than the frame of the goal, it would have been one of those magical Manchester United moments. A young player who the supporters had wanted Ruben Amorim to trust with more minutes proving the hero.",
      "That Lacey was on the pitch at all was a product of more than Darren Fletcher's desire to lean into United's youth legacy but an attacking switch that saw United finish the game with Burnley at Turf Moor with a midfield duo of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "The away support appreciated it, chanting Fletcher's name as well as that of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick - two men touted with a return. But United need more than mere sentiment right now, they are chasing Champions League football.",

John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",

I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",

      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 16:50, UK",
      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",
      "The extra games United would gain from a cup run could prove very important for the rest of their season, as the new head coach (or coaches) try to bed-in their tactical system, and also get some much-needed game-time for the wider squad.",
      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",
      "In the background, of course, is the much more significant process of deciding who should be the head coach going forward.",
      "After paying around £10m in severance to Amorim and his staff, United will again want to try to avoid a big compensation bill for whomever they employ next.",
      "That is at least part of their thinking about why it is best to kick the can down the road, and postpone the big appointment until the summer.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
