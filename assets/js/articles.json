      "Manchester United are 'exploring' a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. The Red Devils have maintained an interest in the 21-year-old since last summer.",
      "The £100million-rated Baleba's current Brighton deal runs until 2028 and has the option of a one-year extension. He is currently impressing for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.",
      "United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that the Reds' big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet. Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad.",
      "Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Baleba are targets, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen told his old club recently to make Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton their top target next summer. “I’m a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer,\" the Dutchman said via BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don’t think the move will be possible until next summer. He’s got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "“He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He’s great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "“His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It’s an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.”",
      "Meanwhile, Reds boss Amorim suggested on Friday afternoon that there will not be any major reinforcements this month. He said: “The transfer window is not going to change.",
      "“We have no conversations in this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.",
      "“We are near the places of the Champions League, but we are near also for like eight teams behind us, so let’s focus on the next game. Just that. Our focus is to win the next game.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim will have some big decisions to make for his Manchester United starting lineup when they travel to Elland Road on Sunday. The Red Devils will be hoping to bounce back after dropping points against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves.",
      "Portuguese coach Amorim will have limited options to choose from for the trip to Yorkshire, however. United will take a depleted squad after Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries for the busiest period of the season.",
      "To compound matters, Amorim can still not choose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Noussair Mazraoui after they progressed to the last-16 at AFCON with Cameroon, Morocco and Ivory Coast. United's boss relented in his tactical rigidity to change formation for a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "A 1-1 draw against Wolves quickly dispelled any hint that Amorim would stick with a back four permanently. The 40-year-old may have it on his mind to swap back to the system when playing old rivals Leeds, however.",
      "United's boss has admitted he is short of options. \"You can see the squad, it is impossible and we cannot stretch the players that we don't have at the moment,\" he said.",
      "\"I will try to put together a team that is ready to cope with that. I will try to read the game and try to understand what I should do to help them.\"",
      "Senne Lammens is an obvious choice in goal after starting 13 games on the bounce since making his debut in October. Those ahead of him are less certain.",
      "But Amorim could be wise to switch to what worked so well against Newcastle and to utilise a back four. That could see Diogo Dalot, the increasingly impressive Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw line up.",
      "With more bodies in advanced positions, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte should form the base of midfield, with few alternative options outside of academy products. Jack Fletcher was chosen from the bench last time out.",
      "Ahead of them, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha can attack from the flanks. The former has transformed into a goal threat since being moved further up the field.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, widely linked to a move before January arrived, should offer some support to lead man Benjamin Sesko. The Dutch star will hope to get on the scoresheet once again.",

      "Manchester United could be in for a significant financial boost due to a clever clause included in Scott McTominay's transfer to Napoli. The Scottish midfielder bid farewell to his childhood club in the summer of 2024, joining the Italian heavyweights in a €30.5m (£25.7m) deal that brought his two-decade-long relationship with United to an end.",
      "The decision to sell McTominay raised eyebrows among fans given United's proud tradition of promoting academy graduates – but the move could prove profitable thanks to a sell-on clause included in the agreement.",
      "As part of the terms, 10 per cent of any future sale from Napoli will go directly back to United. This could result in a substantial payout as the 29-year-old continues to carve out a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, showcasing impressive form for both club and country.",
      "Last year, McTominay was crowned player of the season in Italy following a stellar debut campaign where he played a pivotal role in helping Antonio Conte's team secure the Serie A title. In total, Napoli's No.8 netted 13 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions, earning him a nomination for the esteemed Ballon d'Or award won by Ousmane Dembele.",
      "McTominay has also showcased his skills on the international stage with Scotland, a country he qualifies to represent through his father. In November, he scored a sensational overhead kick as Scotland triumphed over Denmark 4-2, securing the Tartan Army's place in the World Cup for the first time since 1998.",
      "Transfermarkt now values McTominay at approximately €45m (£40m), with two-and-a-half years left on his contract with Napoli. The Italian club currently ranks third in Serie A, trailing leaders Inter by just two points.",
      "A sale at that price would earn United an extra £4m due to their sell-on clause. However, this figure could potentially rise even further, with Napoli reportedly open to offers around £60m.",
      "There are even whispers of a shock return to Old Trafford. CaughtOffside reports that United are considering re-signing McTominay as manager Ruben Amorim seeks to strengthen his thin midfield options.",
      "The long-term futures of Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte are uncertain, while injuries to Mainoo and captain Fernandes have left United lacking in midfield.",
      "This shortage has forced Amorim to field 18 year old academy player Jack Fletcher for 45 minutes against Newcastle United on Boxing Day, and even deploy centre-back Lisandro Martinez in midfield during a match against Aston Villa. Other rumoured targets include Crystal Palace's standout player Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and former United player James Garner, who is currently with Everton.",

      "Sheffield Wednesday are in talks to keep Manchester United youngster Harry Amass at the club until the end of the season. The 18-year-old's spell with the struggling Championship club is currently set to end following the clash against QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday lunchtime.",
      "The on-loan star has been a shining light under difficult circumstances at Hillsborough. Amass has racked up 20 appearances for the Owls and barely missed a minute playing for boss Henrik Pedersen.",
      "The young star's impressive performances have ensured that more clubs have taken an interest in his situation, with Wednesday's initial deal with United only having days left to run. Stoke and Millwall have been named as two of 12 clubs who have expressed an interest in landing Amass in January.",
      "But the player has been very happy at Wednesday and United may decide not to disrupt his momentum mid-campaign. Wednesday boss Pedersen has confirmed that talks are underway for the Yorkshire club's November player of the month award winner. Communication is taking place between Wednesday, United and Amass' representative.",
      "\"There is a dialogue between the clubs and the agent, so I really hope that we can finalise something soon,\" Pedersen said on Friday. \"Of course, we would love to keep him.",
      "\"He has done really, really well. He's 18-years-old, played so many games, which level he has played [at]. Of course the young guy has a lot to learn, but how he has played for us, it has been great.\"",
      "The Owls are in a difficult position to undertake transfer business as they remain in administration and await a takeover. The club are in talks with the English Football League to establish what is possible in the coming weeks.",
      "Currently, Wednesday are anticipated to be restricted to free agents and loan deals that do not require a fee. The club are operating under a fee restriction ban and are not allowed to sign any players for a fee until the end of the 2027 winter transfer window.",
      "“I know there's a dialogue between the club and EFL now,” Pedersen “I hope that we get an answer very, very soon, and hopefully we can do some things so we can get some support to the players. At the minute there's a dialogue, but we need some clarity about what we can do.”",

      "There remain obvious holes in the squad. A new central midfielder was on their radar in the summer but they lacked the finances to pursue the likes of Carlos Baleba or Elliot Anderson. Wing-backs remain a vital part of Amorim's philosophy and he is yet to address that position.",
      "But the Portuguese head coach said on Boxing Day that sometimes he has \"another idea\" to director of football Jason Wilcox and the board when it comes to recruitment, but maintained that \"common ground\" must be found before a signing is made.",

      "The academy star burst onto the scene under Erik ten Hag and within a year of making his debut was playing for England in the final of the Euros. But since the Dutchman's axing his stock has fallen significantly with Amorim preferring other options. Mainoo has started in only 16 of Amorim’s 61 matches in charge of United and last made the starting XI when he played during the humiliating Carabao Cup Cup exit to League Two Grimsby in August - which will have done little to aid his cause for more involvement.",
      "The Sun reports that the working relationship between Mainoo’s camp and Amorim was strained even before the midfielder’s half-brother wore a ‘Free Kobbie Mainoo’ T-shirt at Old Trafford during the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth last month - which again won't have gone down well with the manager.",
      "Despite all that - and links to other clubs - those close to the 20-year-old United star insist he is determined to revive his Old Trafford career and fulfil his potential at the club where he's been since a child.",
      "United blocked Mainoo’s request to leave on loan in the summer and, despite talk resurfacing ahead of January, Amorim again made it clear that the midfielder would not be departing Old Trafford, even temporarily. Despite his lack of minutes the Portuguese head coach has maintained that he is the future of the club.",
      "Mainoo’s contract expires in 2027 but United have the option of an additional year - meaning there is no hope of the player's camp attempting to force a move away but using that to their advantage. That said, Mainoo declined United’s opening offer of a new contract at the start of 2025.",

      "In between, you have the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United. Both will arguably be disappointed by their current league standing, even if United are faring better than they were last season.",
      "Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the table midweek but Riccardo Calafiori and Declan Rice both missed the game through injury and defensive cover looks like being the highest priority. Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet could be a good option for the present and future, though there is likely to be competition from elsewhere in the league.",
      "Depth in attack could be the order of the day, especially if Villa are able to get out-of-favour loanee Harvey Elliott off the books. Newcastle forward William Osula could fit the bill, with earlier reports of a Frankfurt move for the Danish star dimming.",

Boca Juniors star Milton Delgado, who reached the Under-20 World Cup final with his country earlier this year, would fit the Seagulls' tried-and-tested approach of buying young talents with high ceilings.",

      "Palace's first deal is effectively done, with Brennan Johnson on his way from Spurs. A new centre-back could also be added, with an expectation that Marc Guehi leaves in the summer.",
      "A new striker is on Everton's radar, with Thierno Barry flattering to deceive since his summer move. Ivan Toney is expected to prove too expensive but Jorgen Strand Larsen has been mooted.",
      "Marco Silva is hopeful of adding depth to his Fulham squad, especially in attack. United States international Ricardo Pepi looks to have a chance of moving to West London, continuing the Cottagers' rich tradition of American stars.",
      "Leeds spent big in the summer but may feel they need one or two new faces to bolster the fight against relegation. Harry Wilson has been mentioned, and the Welshman is out of contract in the summer so Fulham may entertain bids despite his impressive form this term.",
      "A new centre-back looks important given Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury. Marc Guehi doesn't look likely to leave Crystal Palace until the summer but Liverpool may decide time is of the essence.",
      "An easy one here. Antoine Semenyo adds genuine Premier League quality to an already healthy front line and a £65m fee would feel like a snip if he makes the difference in the hunt for trophies.",
      "United are likely to make a marquee midfield signing in the summer but a cheaper January option is also possible. James Garner ticks the boxes in price and quality, as well as the less tangible 'knows the club' factor.",
      "A new midfielder would allow Newcastle to cash in on Joe Willock, with the former Arsenal man potentially allowed to leave in search of regular minutes. Kees Smit of AZ Alkmaar has been attracting Premier League interest and Newcastle looks to be the most likely destination.",
      "Forest are keen to strengthen down the left flank, while longer-term they may eventually need to replace Elliot Anderson if a big summer bid comes in. On the left, a reunion for manager Sean Dyche and Everton's Dwight McNeil makes sense if the Merseyside club sanction an exit.",
      "Sunderland were very active over the summer and are likely to be less so in January, but a winger could yet arrive despite Brennan Johnson opting against a move north. Paris FC's Ilan Kebbal has been mentioned after impressing in Ligue 1 with six goals and four assists in 16 appearances.",
      "With Johnson leaving, Spurs have money to spend and may well put it towards a new forward of their own. They looked at Man City's Savinho over the summer and could try again this month, but Cameroon star Karl Etta Eyong is another option with a greater immediate goal threat.",
      "A new striker is high on West Ham's radar, with suggestions they could even sign two frontmen after allowing Niclas Fullkrug to join AC Milan on loan. Lazio's Taty Castellanos has struggled with injury this term, hence his low goal tally, but the Argentine looks like an option for the struggling Hammers.",
      "With a miracle needed to avoid relegation, Wolves may need to look long-term. It's hard to see Jorgen Strand Larsen staying put too long, so a move for Sam Surridge - who scored 24 goals in MLS in 2025 - could help them prepare for a likely season in the second tier.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United face a pivotal month as the January transfer window begins to unfold. Ruben Amorim’s side are in the hunt for a Champions League spot but may need reinforcements to get themselves over the line.",
      "The team have provided reasons to be optimistic throughout the season, overcoming tough moments to stay in contention for the top four. United will hope to bounce back from their underwhelming draw with Wolves and reassert themselves with a positive result against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the transfer window, Amorim’s side were linked with several high-profile midfielders but the Portuguese coach has been given an unexpected squad boost at the start of the New Year. Here is a closer look at some of the biggest stories surrounding Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford is relishing his loan spell at Barcelona but fresh doubts have arisen over whether the England international will remain at the club permanently. The 28-year-old has made it clear that he wishes to stay with the Catalan giants beyond this season.",
      "The United loanee has showcased his quality in Spain, scoring seven and registering 11 assists in 24 games. However, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo reports that Rashford is one of three Barcelona players facing an uncertain future at the Camp Nou.",
      "Rashford, alongside Robert Lewandowski and defender Andreas Christensen, is among a trio of stars whose Barcelona deals end in the summer. It is claimed that the United forward has had positive feedback from Barcelona but it is not yet a formality that his parent club will trigger his £26million buy clause.",
      "The Spanish club will reportedly attempt to lower the agreed fee, with Barcelona’s financial constraints well-publicised. It is added that Rashford could improve his pressing and defensive work.",
      "Despite the speculation, Rashford shared a positive message on social as he welcomed in the New Year. He wrote: \"As 2025 comes to a close, I'm grateful for a year of change and self reflection. Stepping into 2026 feeling excited, motivated, and ready to be ambitious both in sport and life.”",
      "Manchester United have confirmed that midfielder Toby Collyer has been recalled from his loan spell at West Bromwich Albion. The 21-year-old made 12 Championship appearances before returning to Old Trafford.",
      "Collyer has been sidelined since picking up an injury in November, leading to his loan spell being cut short. A United club statement explained that the academy graduate had returned to focus on his fitness, while also potentially adding to the options at Amorim’s disposal.",
      "The defensive midfielder featured 13 times for United last term. However, he was unexpectedly called out by Amorim recently as the United boss made a wider point about some of the club’s youngsters being promoted to the first team too early in their development.",
      "\"He (Collyer) played (for United),\" Amorim said in December. \"He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation, what's happened.”",

      "The January transfer window is officially open, and it could be another busy one for Manchester United. The Red Devils are in the market for a new midfielder, while the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee may be on their way out of Old Trafford.",
      "The winter window gives clubs the opportunity to improve their squads and kick on up the table. But sometimes managers are also caught out by injuries, surprise bids and loan recalls, causing them to dip into the market when they didn't necessarily plan to.",
      "United know more about this than some others. They were forced to get busy in January 2023 after Martin Dubravka was re-called by parent club Newcastle United.",
      "Dubravka penned a season-long deal in summer 2022 and was introduced to provide competition for David de Gea but made only two appearances under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Due to these limited minutes, Newcastle saw fit to re-call him just hours after the January window had opened, leaving United short.",
      "A United statement read: \"We would like to thank Martin for his contribution during his time with our club, and wish him all the best for the future.\"",
      "Signing a goalkeeper certainly wasn't part of the transfer plan that year, but it became a priority after Dubravka unexpectedly left the club.",
      "Five days later, United got Crystal Palace shot-stopper Jack Butland on board at Old Trafford on a short-term contract to provide cover. Once he returned to Palace, Butland would then sign for Scottish club Rangers, who he now plays for.",
      "In the summer of 2023, De Gea's own reign in between the sticks at United came to an end, having been at the club since 2011. The Red Devils then acquired the services of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",
      "Onana was introduced to serve as the number one goalkeeper but he has now been shipped out to Trabzonspor on loan, with Senne Lammens the main man. Bayindir now serves as his back-up, with Tom Heaton third-choice.",
      "Lammens has been solid in goal for United, who seem to have finally found their long-term successor to De Gea. He picked up the Player of the Match away in Tuesday night's 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Discussing Lammens' switch to Manchester from Royal Antwerp, the goalkeeper's agent claimed that United originally planned to keep Onana at the club to mentor Lammens.",
      "Speaking to Belgian outlet HBVL, Mark Volders said: \"Those critical voices... the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez.",
      "\"But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust. Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.\"",
      "United will hope they don't have to unexpectedly dive into the market this January, while there are eight names on a shortlist of midfielders who could arrive at Old Trafford this month.",

      "The New Year is upon us and that means it’s only a matter of months before the Premier League trophy will be hoisted into the air once again. The only mystery remains over the identity of the team who will be lifting it.",
      "As it stands, Arsenal are the favourites to be crowned come the end of the campaign. Mikel Arteta's side have enjoyed a brilliant start to the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "Their dominant 4-1 win against Aston Villa has left them four clear at the top of the table. And should that be a position they keep until May, they will end a long wait that has seen them go over two decades without a league title.",
      "They do however have one issue and that’s Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s side have made winning the Premier League a habit. However, they could only earn a point in their first outing of 2026 after drawing 0-0 with Sunderland.",
      "Despite Champions League, Carabao Cup and FA Cup fixtures presenting the Gunners with a few distractions, they will no doubt be prioritising their Premier League title push. Their first fixture in 2026 sees them up against Bournemouth away from home.",
      "They then follow that up with a home game against Liverpool just a few days later. While Arne Slot’s side have not been at their imperious best this season, a clash against the reigning champions still presents a stern challenge.",
      "A trip to Nottingham Forest is then their next assignment nine days later, while a Sunday showdown with Manchester United at the Emirates comes towards the end of the month. Arsenal round off January with an away clash with a resurgent Leeds at Elland Road.",

      "Their tricky run of fixtures continues with a home game against Brighton in midweek before City travel to Old Trafford midway through January for the latest instalment of the Manchester derby.",
      "A home game with rock bottom Wolves should give City an excellent opportunity for maximum points. The same could also be said of a trip to Spurs but given how many times the North London side have got the better of Guardiola and his team over recent years, it might not be as straightforward as some might be expecting.",

      "Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo all missed the 1-1 draw against Wolves on Tuesday and the decision to bring Collyer back to Manchester may well be motivated by a desire to have more options.",
      "The midfielder made his debut for the club in August 2024 and made 13 appearances last season, but was the subject of critical comments from Amorim recently.",
      "The United boss has been called out for making little use of the academy but suggested several young talents, Collyer among them, were promoted to the first-team too early having played in the ill-fated Erik ten Hag era.",
      "\"He (Collyer) played (for United),\" Amorim said in December. \"He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever. It's the situation, what's happened.",
      "\"I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido (Obi) is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Despite those comments Collyer is highly though of in Manchester, so much so that the club refused to consider him as part of any deal that could've seen the Red Devils sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton.",
      "There had been reports suggesting Collyer could be used as a sweetener to sign Baleba back in the summer. The youngster had progressed through Brighton's academy before leaving in 2022 and the Seagulls had been keen to bring him back to the south coast, where he is from.",
      "Collyer is regarded as one of the finest midfielders in the country and United were surprised they had the chance to sign him - but they were delighted that they did.",

      "However, his relationship with Sheringham was marked by tension and animosity. Now, the 54-year-old has revisited the roots of their dispute, offering fresh insight into this well-documented rivalry, including the three incidents that led to their silence.",
      "\"It started when I was playing for England,\" Cole said on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"I was going to make my England debut.",
      "\"He [Sheringham] was he was coming off and he just snubbed me on the line. So straight away, my head just falls off. I remember growing up as a kid watching England, whoever made their debut, anyone who came off for them would always make a big beeline for that person coming on.",

      "\"Debuts are supposed to mean a hell of a lot to whoever it is, whatever respective country you're going to play for. To know that I didn't get someone respecting me on my debut, it was just playing with my head straight away.\"",
      "Sheringham's arrival at Old Trafford in 1997 saw the pair's relationship deteriorate further. Cole recalled: \"When he joined Man United, I remember sitting there and saying to myself, 'Oh my gosh, problems, problems.'",
      "\"So I've walked in on the first day and I've gone to the dressing room and the boys are absolutely hammering me. Calling us best mates and everything like that. Then pre-season, it was in Milan or somewhere like that and he said something to me. I'm like, 'Do you know how long I've been at Man United now? I mean, I think I know how to play.'",
      "\"That kind of set the time bomb off. Then we played Bolton and it ended 1-1. He said the Bolton goal was my fault. I lost it. Proper lost it. I'm usually the last person off the pitch. I don't rush down the tunnel or anything like that. But I remember then I was the first one down the tunnel.",
      "\"I ran to the dressing room and I'm waiting for him to come in. Then it goes off in the dressing room and then the manager pulls me in. He said, 'This can't go on. I know you two don't get on, but I can't condone that in the dressing room.'",

      "Manchester United won't be seeing their Africa Cup of Nations trio any time soon - but Ruben Amorim can at least take heart from the fact they are being managed carefully while on international duty.",
      "United have been seriously depleted in recent matches, with Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui away at AFCON, while Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Mason Mount have all picked up injuries. It has coincided with the busiest period of the season, forcing Amorim to adapt.",
      "Those adaptions were going well when a much-changed side held on to record a 1-0 win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. But a 1-1 draw against the Premier League's bottom side, Wolves, quickly dispelled any hint of optimism, potentially sending Amorim back to the drawing board.",
      "United were pretty uninspired in attack against Wolves and needed a fluky deflected effort from Joshua Zirkzee to find the back of the net. How the Portuguese boss must have wished he could call upon Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "He therefore won't have been delighted to see that Morocco, Cameroon and Ivory Coast all made it out of the group stages at AFCON. Mazraoui, Mbeumo and Amad are now looking forward to knockout matches in Morocco, rather than United's game against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Cameroon came from 1-0 down to beat Mozambique 2-1 on New Year's Eve, while defending champions Ivory Coast also mounted a comeback to beat Gabon 3-2 and top Group F. The results mean that Cameroon will play South Africa in the last 16, while Ivory Coast will face Burkina Faso. Morocco had already booked their knockout match against Tanzania on Sunday.",
      "Mid-season tournaments are always a tricky thing to negotiate for club managers, who wish their players well but ultimately have selfish motives. They want them back as quickly as possible and without any injuries.",
      "So Amorim will have been pleased to see Mbeumo taken off at half-time in Cameroon's win against Mozambique - not because of an injury, but to manage his minutes. Amad, meanwhile, started Ivory Coast's game on the bench and came on as a 76th-minute substitute.",
      "Morocco and Cameroon play their last 16 games on Sunday - the same day United travel to Elland Road to face Leeds - while Ivory Coast are next in action on Tuesday. It means that, in theory, if their national sides lose, Mazraoui and Mbeumo could be back with United in time for their trip to Turf Moor to play Burnley on Wednesday, January 7.",
      "Amad, however, wouldn't be back until the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton on Sunday, January 11, at the earliest, if Ivory Coast are beaten by Burkina Faso.",
      "Amorim will therefore have to continue to put his faith in United's academy players, who have been given rare opportunities to play first-team minutes. Jack Fletcher and Bendito Mantato came off the bench against Wolves, while Tyler Fredricson got minutes in the win over Newcastle.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson warned against clubs using the January transfer window to find a quick fix. Manchester United have been linked with several deals in the New Year, but the legendary manager advised teams to avoid big-money moves during the winter window.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side are chasing a return to Champions League football but currently sit two points off fourth-placed Liverpool, who could extend the gap with a win over Leeds on Thursday night. Though there have been signs of improvement across the campaign, United’s recent stalemate with Wolves reminded fans of their team’s shortcomings.",
      "The transfer window offers Amorim an opportunity to strengthen his squad, both in the short and long term. However, Ferguson previously explained why he believed making major signings in January was not worth the risk.",
      "In 2012, Ferguson stated that no marquee January signing had ever been an instant success. \"I've never seen it work, a player come in January, sign for big money and settle before the start of next season,” the United boss told The Independent.",
      "He added: \"To go into the market in January you never get full value, people think you're desperate so ask for more.\"",
      "Ferguson largely stuck to his own advice throughout his tenure, despite two of his best-ever signings both arriving in January 2006. Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra cost a combined £12.5million from their respective clubs but did not immediately establish themselves as stars, taking time to settle in at Old Trafford.",
      "While the success rate of major January signings is mixed, there are notable exceptions, including United skipper Bruno Fernandes. Focusing on the current transfer window, United are claimed to have assembled an eight-man shortlist of centre midfielders to bolster Amorim’s team.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Nottingham Forest ’s Elliot Anderson is top of the club’s wishlist, though a deal is unlikely as his team continue to battle relegation. Brighton’s highly-rated Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton were both heavily linked with United in the summer.",
      "England international Conor Gallagher has previously been touted with swapping Atletico Madrid for Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Everton’s James Garner has also been linked with a return to his boyhood club.",
      "Other options mentioned in the report are Bournemouth's Tyler Adams, Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes and Portugal international Ruben Neves, who currently plays for Al-Hilal. Whether United opt to spend big in January remains to be seen but Amorim has been short of midfield options in recent weeks.",
      "Injuries to Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo saw United start with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte in midfield against Wolves, with youngster Jack Fletcher being introduced at half-time. Ferguson would support Amorim utilising the club’s academy talent to solve the club’s midfield issue, rather than seeking an expensive solution in January.",
      "One of the only exceptions Ferguson made during his reign was to sign Louis Saha from Fulham in early 2004, who instantly began repaying his £12.85m fee with seven goals in 14 games. Experienced striker Henrik Larsson was also brought in on a short-term loan as Ferguson sought an immediate boost in 2007. However, the vast majority of his January dealings focused on long-term prospects.",
      "Wilfried Zaha became the last signing of the Ferguson era when he completed his £10m move from Crystal Palace in January 2013. Viewed as a player for the future, he was loaned back to Palace. In the following campaign, Zaha made just four appearances during his sole season at United before rejoining Palace permanently that summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The January transfer window is shaping up to be an intriguing one for Manchester United. Over the past weeks and months, several high-profile stars have been linked with moves to the Theatre of Dreams, while a number of established squad members look to be nearing the exit door.",
      "Historically, United's mid-season transfers have been hit and miss. For every game-changing arrival like Nemanja Vidic or Bruno Fernandes, there has been an Alexis Sanchez or a Dong Fangzhuo.",
      "Ruben Amorim's squad will aim to carry their relatively strong end-of-2025 momentum into the New Year and start the campaign strongly, as the club pursues its first top-four finish in three seasons. Navigating the January window successfully could be crucial - not just for turning United's season into a memorable one, but also in cementing Amorim's long-term position at the club.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has been in sensational form at Bournemouth this season, attracting serious interest from United as a potential solution to their lack of width and firepower up top. His ability to take on defenders and finish clinically has boosted his profile significantly in recent months, with a release clause making him an appealing mid-season target.",
      "However, United seem to have slipped behind in the race, with rivals Manchester City closing in on his signature. Reports suggest a deal at the Etihad Stadium could be completed this week, meaning United supporters might see the Ghanaian in blue rather than red this winter.",
      "Crystal Palace's midfielder has become one of the Premier League's most wanted deep-lying playmakers due to his outstanding passing and calmness under pressure. Amorim reportedly sees him as the perfect 'metronome' to control the tempo of his 3-4-3 system and facilitate transitions from the defensive third.",
      "Signing Wharton will not be cheap, with Palace expected to demand at least £70million for their star - and possibly much more to sanction a mid-season transfer. While United's interest is genuine, a January deal is considered difficult, as the Eagles aim to retain their squad until summer.",
      "Carlos Baleba has impressed United scouts as a high-energy, all-action midfielder capable of rejuvenating the current squad. His capacity to break up play and surge forward with the ball fits perfectly with the high-pressing requirements of modern United football.",
      "Brighton are known as tough negotiators and are likely to insist on a fee close to £100m given his long-term promise, as they did in the summer. While United are said to be eager to secure the Cameroonian, Brighton's valuation may make a move this month unlikely.",
      "After a breakthrough season at Nottingham Forest, Elliot Anderson has become a top midfield target for several leading clubs. His technical skill in tight areas and tireless work rate make him stand out in both the Premier League and Thomas Tuchel's England squad.",
      "Forest are reportedly seeking at least £100m for the former Newcastle United player and are unlikely to consider a mid-season sale. Coupled with strong interest from Manchester City and Chelsea, a January move appears highly challenging.",
      "Stuttgart's playmaker has been identified as a refined alternative for United's midfield, offering exceptional football intelligence and advanced ball progression. Excelling in the Bundesliga and for Germany, he is viewed as ready to step straight into a top European club.",
      "Stiller reportedly has a release clause around £34million, effective in 2026. United could see him as a cost-efficient option compared with other targets - a consideration made even more relevant given injuries and possible departures in their midfield.",
      "In what would be both a sentimental and strategic acquisition, United are reportedly exploring a return for former academy graduate James Garner from Everton to strengthen squad depth. Garner has developed into a dependable Premier League performer, whose energy and tactical awareness would offer a low-risk midfield solution.",
      "Garner's contract runs until the end of the season, allowing the Red Devils to potentially secure him at a reduced cost if Everton are unwilling to lose him for free in the summer.",
      "Ex-Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher has struggled for playing time at Atletico Madrid this season and is reportedly eager to return to England to secure a spot in the 2026 World Cup squad. United value his 'engine' and Premier League experience, seeing him as an immediate boost to midfield intensity.",
      "Atletico are understood to be willing to consider a sale at around £30m, though United may be able to negotiate a lower price given Gallagher's limited appearances this term. It may not be a headline-grabbing move, but Gallagher could be a clever addition for a United side short on energy and depth in central midfield.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt wing-back Nathaniel Brown has come onto United's radar as a solution for their ongoing left-sided issues. His pace and ability to offer width in a back-five make him a highly tactical fit for Amorim's system.",
      "As an emerging Bundesliga talent, the 22-year-old could cost around £50m, representing a high-risk option given his lack of top-level experience. Still, with United in need of elite wing-backs, Brown could be a gamble worth pursuing.",
      "Although hailed as one of United's brightest prospects in 2024, Kobbie Mainoo has dropped out of Amorim's first-team plans and is expected to leave in January. The midfielder wants regular playing time, especially with the World Cup approaching, and is reportedly pushing for a loan.",
      "Several top European clubs are monitoring his situation should a temporary move be approved. However, with United short in midfield, the club are hesitant to allow him to leave without first finding a replacement. A loan appears likely, but an incoming signing may need to come first.",
      "Following a difficult spell on the sidelines and limited first-team opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is widely expected to depart this winter to restart his career.",
      "With his contract expiring in summer, United are keen to sell rather than lose him for free - and are reportedly open to bids as low as £3m for the Dutchman.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has struggled to replicate the goal-scoring form that prompted his move from Bologna. Reports indicate AS Roma have made a formal loan proposal with an obligation to buy, as the striker is keen to return to Serie A.",
      "United are reviewing the offer but may wait until a replacement is secured before approving the move. This transfer looks highly likely, with all parties aligned on a fresh start.",
      "Despite his recent arrival, speculation suggests Ugarte may not fit the specific midfield style Amorim wants. While still a top-class ball-winner, interest from other European clubs has raised questions over his long-term future at Old Trafford.",
      "United are open to selling, but only for the right fee. Turkish giants Galatasaray are among the interested clubs and are reportedly preparing a loan-plus-option-to-buy bid this month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will hope to start the New Year on a positive note as the club prepare to face Leeds United this weekend. Ruben Amorim's side are set to renew their rivalry with the Yorkshire club at Elland Road on Sunday.",
      "The turn of the year also marks the beginning of the January transfer window. United have been linked with several deals, both incomings and outgoings, as Amorim seeks to improve his team in their pursuit of a Champions League place.",
      "Whether a change will come through the manager placing more trust in youth prospects or refining his squad in the transfer market remains to be seen. However, one player has revealed why he chose to leave Old Trafford during Amorim’s reign. Here is a closer look at some of the biggest stories surrounding the club.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted that he purposely avoided bringing on more academy starlets as his team chased a winning goal against Wolves. The club endured a disappointing 1-1 draw on Tuesday night, with Wolves picking up just their third point of the campaign.",
      "The United boss opted to replace goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee with young midfielder Jack Fletcher at the interval, with Leny Yoro and debutant Bendito Mandato being brought on later in the game. However, Amorim avoided utilising the attacking options of Shea Lacey and Chido Obi as he felt they would further disrupt his team, given United's lengthy list of absentees.",
      "“It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,” Amorim explained.",
      "\"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has revealed what convinced him to leave Manchester United this summer. The striker had previously been determined to stay at Old Trafford before securing a deadline day loan move to Napoli.",
      "It has proven to be a beneficial switch for Hojlund, who has already bettered his league goal tally from last season. The 22-year-old, who has scored six in 12 Serie A matches, has shared what eventually persuaded him to leave United.",
      "When asked why he changed his decision, Hojlund told Sports Illustrated: \"United made it very quite clear that I wasn't part of their plans for this year, coming into the season. And with no European football, I think Napoli saw an opportunity to go and get me. As soon as I heard of their interest, I made it quite obvious to my camp and the people around me that I only wanted to go there.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has shared a New Year's message without even so much as mentioning Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently flourishing during his loan spell with Barcelona, netting seven goals and providing 11 assists across 24 outings in all competitions.",
      "It's been an incredibly productive year for Rashford, who earned a recall to the England squad on the back of his impressive form during temporary spells at both Aston Villa and Barcelona. Rashford has managed to capture the best moments of his year in nine photographs on Instagram, predominantly featuring him in a Barcelona shirt.",
      "In his message, he wrote: \"As 2025 comes to a close, I'm grateful for a year of change and self reflection. Stepping into 2026 feeling excited, motivated, and ready to be ambitious both in sport and life. MR14 [red and blue heart emoji].\"",
      "Whilst there's no direct reference to United, there is a Villa photograph that shows the spot-kick he converted against Manchester City, which clearly indicates his pride in that particular moment.",
      "Spain's winter break has meant Rashford and Barcelona have enjoyed an extended rest period - with their most recent match taking place 10 days ago on Sunday, December 21.",
      "Rashford started that 2-0 triumph on the subs bench, but he then entered the action for the closing 28 minutes. Hansi Flick chose to field Raphinha, Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal as his attacking three behind the striker, with the same trio getting the nod from the start in the Champions League victory against Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Rashford subsequently provided an assist after coming off the bench in that match. Despite being overlooked on two occasions, Rashford responded to the team selection decisions in exemplary fashion, according to Flick.",
      "He said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied me; 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions',\" Flick said on Rashford. \"'The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I'm so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "It comes as little shock that most Spanish media outlets are suggesting that Flick would be keen for Barcelona to secure Rashford from United on a permanent basis next summer.",
      "The purchase option included in his transfer is understood to be approximately £26million. Despite the relatively modest fee, questions remain over whether Barcelona could actually meet that figure, though, given their widely documented financial struggles.",
      "Certain reports suggest that Barcelona must decide between Rashford and a high-profile striker signing, given the long-term worries over 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski.",

      "January is arguably one of the toughest months for Premier League managers. Not only have we reached the halfway stage of the season and fixture congestion begins to ramp up with the FA Cup returning for the top flight, teams also have to negotiate a transfer window.",
      "For Manchester United, the January transfer window very rarely offers much optimism for supporters. In their recent history, the Reds have chosen not to make big transfer statements midway through the season, even when new additions were desperately needed.",
      "When everyone knew United needed to add a centre-forward to their attack under Erik ten Hag, the Reds were left to settle with the arrival of Wout Weghorst in the January transfer window. While the Dutchman had performed well for his national team, the Premier League was clearly too big a step for the target man.",
      "Of course, clubs like United have to be wary of overspending in the mid-season window. It appears Ruben Amorim will watch the 2026 window go by without making any alterations to his team.",
      "He explained in his pre-Leeds press conference: \"We have no conversations in this moment about having any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea that is going to continue.\" This prediction is bad news for United.",
      "It is clear to United fans that at least one change should be made this month. In terms of outgoings, Joshua Zirkzee is obviously not a player who Amorim has much faith in.",
      "His substitution against Wolves at half time, despite scoring, was a clear sign the forward has no future at the club. Sadly for Zirkzee, he is not good enough to lead the line for United and, playing deeper in the No.10 role, he is not better than Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad or Mason Mount.",
      "The right thing to do in the January transfer window is to let Zirkzee leave, especially with Roma keen. If that deal was done, there would have been space available to add a striker to the squad who could compete with Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, the claim of no changes being made to the squad in the January transfer window suggests this plan is not under consideration. This is a blow for the Reds as they look to gain some consistency while pushing for a place in the top four.",
      "Fortunately for United, there was some positive news to close out the press conference. Amorim was asked whether he expected any of his players to come to him and request their exit from Old Trafford this month. \"No,\" Amorim replied. \"I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything.\"",
      "If this proves to be the case, it would be great news for the Reds. One of the main fears in the January transfer window is that Kobbie Mainoo will push hard for an exit in an attempt to play regularly before the World Cup.",
      "Mainoo leaving in January would be a disaster for the Reds. Not only would United be losing one of their best academy graduates in recent years, they would also be left painfully short in the midfield. Even if Mainoo only left on loan, a temporary exit would still see him take a step closer to a possible permanent exit.",
      "Injuries to Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes have proven the Reds are lacking playmakers in this squad. The Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro combination does not offer much in the way of creativity, that much is clear.",
      "United cannot afford for Mainoo to leave. If he is looking to stay in Manchester and fight for his place, that can only be good news for the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim said there are no conversations ongoing with the Manchester United hierarchy about signing new players in the January transfer window, despite the club being in the fight to qualify for next season's Champions League.",
      "United are sixth at the halfway stage of the Premier League campaign, level on points with Chelsea in fifth and only three points shy of Liverpool in fourth, but Amorim insisted that wouldn't change the plans the club have made.",
      "Amorim has previously suggested that United would consider making a move in January if the conditions were right and they were open to activating Antoine Semenyo's £65million release clause at Bournemouth, only for the attacker to opt for Manchester City.",
      "But the United head coach has now claimed there are no active conversations with director of football Jason Wilcox or chief executive Omar Berrada over strengthening the squad this month, despite the club finding themselves in a position to achieve their target of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"The transfer window is not going to change, we have no conversation to have any change in the squad,\" said Amorim. \"There is a process, there is an idea, we are near the places of Champions League, but we're also near eight teams behind us, so let’s focus on the next game.\"",
      "Amorim cut a more despondent figure over transfers than in recent weeks. Speaking on December 20, he had sounded more upbeat over the chances of adding to the squad this month.",
      "\"We will see. The only thing we know is we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be the future,\" he said that day. \"It’s not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON, it’s not going to be like that.",
      "\"Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it’s not the position that we need more. We will try to bring now, and [at] the end of the season, players that are perfect for our future. So, I don’t know what is going to happen, but it is possible that we can do something.\"",
      "Amorim also stressed that nobody had asked to leave the club this month, despite Roma showing strong interest in Joshua Zirkzee, while Kobbie Mainoo is open to a loan move having struggled for regular football this season. Asked if anyone had knocked on his door to ask to leave, Amorim siad: \"No, none of them. I don’t expect them to come to me to ask [to leave].\"",

      "Manchester United have the opportunity to secure a key transfer for Ruben Amorim, despite the Portuguese's recent comments on the club's January transfer plans.",
      "Their attempted move for Carlos Baleba in the summer hinted that a new midfielder would be prioritised. A host of names have been linked with strengthening Amorim's midfield, but the possibility of a move weighs heavily on the future of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "However, on just the second day of January, Amorim's words on United's business point towards a window that may disappointment most. Amorim previously suggested that they would consider making a move if the deal was right, although he also stated they must make no mistakes.",
      "Now, the United boss has claimed there are no active conversations with Director of Football Jason Wilcox or Chief Executive Omar Berrada regarding incomings this month. \"The transfer window is not going to change, we have no conversation to have any change in the squad,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"There is a process, there is an idea, we are near the places of Champions League, but we're also near eight teams behind us, so let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim's words will likely cause concern among supporters due to there being areas for improvement within the squad. However, not all is bad, as reports from Italy link United with a move that would strengthen the team in the summer.",
      "Calciomercato have claimed that United are one of the three clubs considering a move for AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan. The France international is now in the final six months of his contract at the San Siro and could leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "Maignan came close to joining Chelsea at the start of the season, but the Premier League side opted against meeting Milan's valuation. The Italian side is keen on extending his stay, but the goalkeeper is yet to commit to his future.",
      "United changed their goalkeeper in the summer with Senne Lammens replacing Andre Onana, who joined Turkish side Trabzonspor. The Belgian has largely impressed in his first six months in England, although he has faced criticism for a number of goals conceded in recent months.",
      "Before Lammens signed, they had shown interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martínez. Next summer, the opportunity to sign one of Europe's top goalkeepers on a free transfer will be available, and it would undoubtedly improve Amorim's squad.",
      "Now that the January transfer window is open, United can agree to a pre-contract. But they will have to act quickly if they decide to make a move. Calciomercato have also claimed that Milan directors will meet with the goalkeeper's entourage after their Serie A clash with Cagliari on Friday.",

      "Ruben Amorim isn't expecting any of Manchester United's injured players to return to the fold against Leeds on Sunday as he prepares to put his faith in youth once again. Harry Maguire hasn't played since November 8 due to a thigh injury and Matthijs de Ligt has been missing for six weeks with a back problem.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has missed nearly two weeks of action with a calf injury, and Mason Mount was withdrawn at half-time against Newcastle on Boxing Day. Bruno Fernandes injured his hamstring against Aston Villa and is still sidelined, while United are already without Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, with Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon into the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim confirmed there were no new injury concerns for his squad, but ahead of a final training session on Saturday before the trip to Elland Road, he didn't expect any players to return. \"No issues, we’re going to see tomorrow, I don’t think anyone is going to recover,\" he said.",
      "United face an in-form Leeds side, who are now six games unbeaten after earning a New Year's Day point at Anfield despite resting Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Noah Okafor. Amorim admitted the pace in Daniel Farke's side could cause his team some problems.",
      "\"They have a lot of pace and sometimes we struggle with pace,\" he said. \"We prove that we can win any game in any situation in every context. We will try to do that. We know they change the system; the last game they rotated two players who are usually the starters. Good players, and a good manager.",
      "\"I heard that it’s a big derby, great environment, big rivalry, but every game in the Premier League is so tough. It’s one more game, I know it means a lot to the fans but we need to go there and try to win.\"",
      "Amorim turned to teenagers Jack Fletcher and Bendito Mantato off the bench against Wolves earlier this week and might have to use the kids once again, despite the hostile atmosphere United are likely to face across the Pennines.",
      "\"We look to everything, but they need to be prepared,\" he said. \"You can see the squad, it’s impossible to stretch the players we don’t have. I try to put a team ready to cope with that and read the game to help them.",
      "\"They have to [be ready]. It’s a game in a hostile environment, but they need to experience that. It’s going to be hard for every player, even players with lots of experience.\"",
      "This will be Amorim's first trip to Elland Road and his first taste of the rivalry between United and Leeds. He has experienced similar fixtures in Portugal as a player for Benfica and coach of Sporting, but expects this to be different.",
      "\"I never experienced this one. In Portugal it [Benfica vs Sporting] is a big rivalry, different environment, different culture. The noise is going to be big, it’s hard to compare different cultures, different derbies, let’s just focus on the derby, we will try to win.",
      "\"When you play for Manchester United you need to be ready for everything and you guys have the best league in the world. You see every week there are a lot of draws, you never control, never understand, it’s going to be tough but it’s tough every week in the Premier League.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has completed his press conference ahead of the clash with Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim expects to have the same squad available to him on Sunday as the one which faced Wolves in midweek. This means the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount have not overcome the injury issues.",
      "United's manager claimed he was looking forward to the clash with Leeds, explaining he knows how important the game at Elland Road is to the fanbase. Amorim also insisted he had no qualms throwing academy players into a game of this calibre.",
      "As for the January transfer window, United fans have been told to expect few changes to the squad in January. They are not currently planning any changes as they head into the second half of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim confirmed he was not expecting any players to request an exit from Old Trafford before the end of the January window.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say below...",
      "Amorim isn't expecting any of Manchester United's injured players to return to the fold against Leeds on Sunday as he prepares to put his faith in youth once again. Harry Maguire hasn't played since November 8 due to a thigh injury and Matthijs de Ligt has been missing for six weeks with a back problem. Kobbie Mainoo has missed nearly two weeks of action with a calf injury, and Mason Mount was withdrawn at half-time against Newcastle on Boxing Day. Bruno Fernandes injured his hamstring against Aston Villa and is still sidelined, while United are already without Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo, with Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon into the knockout stages of the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim said there are no conversations ongoing with the Manchester United hierarchy about signing new players in the January transfer window, despite the club being in the fight to qualify for next season's Champions League. United are sixth at the halfway stage of the Premier League campaign, level on points with Chelsea in fifth and only three points shy of Liverpool in fourth, but Amorim insisted that wouldn't change the plans the club have made.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is all from the first part of Amorim's press conference. Those quotes are tidied up now. The second part of Amorim's press conference will be live at 10:30pm this evening.",
      "No, none have asked. I don't expect them to come to me and ask anything.",
      "We will look to everything but they need to be prepared. You can see the squad, it is impossible and you cannot stretch the players we do not have in the moment. But of course I will try to pick the team that is ready to cope with that and then I will try to read the game and understand what I can do to help them to win the game.",
      "They have to [handle the atmosphere]. It is a game in a hostile environment but they need to be ready. They need to experience that but it is going to be hard for any player - even the guys with a lot of experience but, again, we have already experienced that. Bilbao last year was amazing, the sound, I know that feeling is completely different but we need to be ready.",
      "The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversations in this moment about having any change in the squad. There is a process, there is an idea that is going to continue. We are near the Champions League places but we are near also to like 18th behind us so let's focus on the next game, just that, and our focus is to win the next game.",
      "It is different, I have never experienced this one. In Portugal, there is big rivalries, here it's the same. Different environment, different culture but the noise is going to be big. We just have to perform but it is hard to compare different cultures, different derbies, different history. Let's just focus on the game - it is 11 guys vs our 11 in the beginning and we will try to win.",
      "When you play for United you need to be ready for everything. You guys have the best league in the world. Every game now and you see every week there is a lot of draws, you never understand what is going to happen at the end of that week. So it is going to be tough but it is always tough nowadays in the Premier League.",
      "They have a lot of pace sometimes we struggle with pace. They are confident but we proved we can win any game in any situation, in every context, so we will try to do that again. We know they change the system, they have different players in front. The last game they rotated two players [Calvert-Lewin, Okafor] that usually are the starters. So they have good players, good manager, great environment so it is going to be a tough game.",
      "We are playing better when we have the full squad we are clearly attacking better. We have not been good enough in the details. We should have more points in the moment but of course we are always wanting more and, again, we should have more points in the table.",
      "I heard it is a big derby, a great environment, big rivalry but every game in the Premier League is so tough so it is one more game. I know it means a lot to the fans but we need to go there and try to win.",
      "We are going [to Leeds] with no different issues. We shall see tomorrow, we have more training. I don't think anyone is going to recover but we will see.",
      "Amorim is here and the press conference will be underway shortly...",
      "Following his side's draw at Liverpool, Farke expressed his anger at the 12.30 kick-off time for Sunday's clash with the Reds when his team played on New Year's Day.",
      "I hope they can recover quickly and we'll see probably some late decisions for Sunday, when we have the earliest possible kick-off, straight after breakfast more or less, whyever this is after a late evening kick-off. today. So Man United since two days already on the sofa, whatever. We will find solutions for this fixture and at Elland Road, even if the legs will be a bit tight, we also have a chance, and we'll go for it again on Sunday.",
      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim. Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "There should be plenty of topics to discuss during Amorim's press conference this afternoon, here are just some of the things we are expecting to be on the agenda:",
      "We are just one hour away from Amorim speaking to the media ahead of the clash with Leeds on Sunday. What questions would you like to see the boss asked this afternoon?",
      "Due to scheduling, United have the chance to put the pressure on the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool early on Sunday. Should they beat Leeds, they will move above Liverpool into fourth in the Premier League before the pair have played this weekend. It may only be for a short period but moving into the top-four would be a boost for the Reds.",
      "As always, injuries will be a topic of conversation this afternoon when Amorim speaks to the media. Ahead of this game, United are currently missing a host of first-team players including; Fernandes, Mount, Mainoo, Maguire and De Ligt. Whether any of them can return this weekend remains to be seen. Mount and Mainoo are the two most likely to be back for the trip to Elland Road but Amorim will let us know if they have been cleared.",
      "Somewhat surprisingly on New Year's Day, United confirmed young midfielder Toby Collyer had been recalled from his loan spell at Championship club West Brom. Collyer had not played for the Baggies since the end of November after sustaining an injury against Birmingham City.",
      "Read more about his return here>>>",
      "In an ideal world, Manchester United would have already started their January transfer window with a bang. They were one of several clubs that were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, and although that ship hasn't yet sailed, it is now looking unlikely. Semenyo is set to leave Bournemouth this month, and United would have paid his £65million release clause, but as it stands, it looks like Manchester City are set to win the battle for the 25-year-old. United were strongly in the race, however.",
      "Rather than focusing on a signing to strengthen the attack, this approach for Semenyo was for United to bring forward the pursuit of a long-term target because he was going to be on the move now. It is a theme which is set to condition their January window.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim will be addressing the media at 1.15pm this afternoon at Carrington with an embargo set until 1.30pm. From then, we shall have everything Amorim has to say before the trip to Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Good morning and welcome along to our live press conference blog as we prepare to hear from the United manager for the first time in 2026. The Reds take on Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday.",
      "United will be under no illusions over the threat Leeds pose after they picked up a respectable point at Anfield on New Year's Day. United will hope they have at least one player to call upon again following injury. Mainoo appears to be the midfielder closest to a return to the squad but Amorim has insisted he will not be rushing any of his players back.",
      "Stay tuned for Amorim's press conference..."

      "However, the report also claims that a move is unlikely to happen as the Seagulls plan to keep hold of the midfielder until at least the summer transfer window. United spent heavily in the most recent summer transfer window, but it appears that the Reds' big spending under Ruben Amorim is not finished quite yet.",
      "Amorim wants midfield reinforcements as his No.1 priority to rebuild his squad. Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Baleba are targets, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen told his old club recently to make Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton their top target next summer.",
      "“I’m a big fan of Wharton; I think he should be the number one priority for United next summer,\" the Dutchman said via BestNewBingoSites.",
      "“He would be the perfect player to add to their squad, but I don’t think the move will be possible until next summer. He’s got great feet, and he is an effective and efficient player.",
      "“He is always looking forward when he has the ball, which is a top-quality trait to have as a midfielder. He’s great in small spaces when he is being closed down quickly, and he always breaks the lines to find his unmarked teammates.",
      "“His range of passing is second to none, and he has Premier League experience playing in the same formation that Amorim is playing at Man United. It’s an absolute no-brainer for United to sign Wharton next summer.”",
      "Meanwhile, Reds boss Amorim suggested on Friday afternoon that there will not be any major reinforcements this month. He said: “The transfer window is not going to change.",
      "“We have no conversations in this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to be fit before the end of January, but the midfielder could remain at Manchester United for the rest of the season, rather than being loaned out again. The 21-year-old was officially recalled from his loan with Championship side West Brom on New Year's Day, but he has been at Carrington since the end of November after suffering a calf injury with the Baggies.",
      "Collyer struggled for game time before suffering his injury setback, starting just three Championship games and making 12 appearances in total. After sustaining his injury, he has been undergoing rehabilitation with his parent club. He could have returned to the Hawthorns when fit, but United have made the decision to recall him from a planned season-long loan due to concerns over his playing time in the Midlands, as well as his injury issue.",
      "The former Brighton youngster is expected to be fit again by the end of this month, having not featured competitively since sustaining a calf injury during West Brom’s 1-1 draw with Birmingham City in late November.",
      "Collyer will be monitored now that he is back at United and could stay at the club for the remainder of the season if Ruben Amorim decides to keep him as part of the first-team squad.",
      "The midfielder has made 13 appearances for United, 10 of which came under Amorim last season. Although United will have a light schedule in the second half of the season, there is uncertainty over the futures of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with both attracting loan interest.",
      "If Collyer plays for United this month, it would prohibit another loan move, as players can only play for two clubs during a season. If he doesn't feature, then another loan switch to play first-team football remains an option.",
      "United face an injury crisis in midfield at the moment, but Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are expected to be fit this month.",

      "If Semenyo does opt for the Etihad, United won't switch attention to plan B. There isn't a desperate desire to improve the attack in this window.",
      "If anything, it is the midfield which needs work, and a deal there could depend on outgoings. United are planning a significant overhaul in the centre of the pitch this year, although they will be happy to wait until the summer window to kickstart that process.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has started the ball rolling on speculation around his own future again, although he won't be going anywhere this month. The same is true of Casemiro, who is out of contract in the summer. Manuel Ugarte is wanted by Galatasaray but is currently back in the team and unlikely to depart.",
      "The biggest story of the month is therefore likely to be Kobbie Mainoo, who wants to leave on loan to play regular football, having failed to start a Premier League game under Amorim this season. Napoli are keen to take the 20-year-old until the end of the season.",
      "Mainoo is due back from a calf injury shortly and his departure wouldn't be considered while Fernandes is out with a hamstring injury and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he wants the academy graduate to stay and fight for his place and a loan move later in January might depend on whether the change in formation presents him with more opportunities and if Mainoo pushes to go. If he does, United might have to consider a move for a midfielder, although premium targets such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson will likely be out of reach in January.",
      "There could also be an exit for Joshua Zirkzee in January. Roma remain keen on the Dutch forward and are looking to put together a loan move that could include an option to buy. Zirkzee is only likely to be allowed to move once Amad and Mbeumo return from AFCON.",
      "There is also likely to be a January move for Tyrell Malacia, who was part of the bomb squad in the summer but was unable to find a new club. He made his first appearance in 11 months against Newcastle but will be made available this month.",

      "When Joshua Zirkzee was substituted at half time in the recent draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers, despite scoring, it was perhaps a sign of just where his Manchester United career is at this moment. The Dutchman is clearly on borrowed time at Old Trafford and with AS Roma sniffing around him, there is every chance he leaves in January.",
      "The only issue with that is it would leave United short in the attack. Currently, their only recognised centre-forward is Benjamin Sesko. Zirkzee, on paper, is also a centre-forward but it has been proven time and again he plays much better when not asked to lead the line.",
      "The only alternative then would be young Chido Obi but the teenager is far from being ready for the first-team limelight. That means United would need to add a striker to their squad should Zirkzee leave but this is, of course, easier said than done.",
      "Any striker worth their salt should be unattainable in the January transfer window. Forward Antoine Semenyo was the exception to the rule but that ship appears to have sailed for the Reds with Manchester City closing on his signature. So where could United look to turn?",
      "One option, according to reports, is Crystal Palace centre-forward Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Frenchman, if available, would be a brilliant addition to the United squad. As the summer transfer window proved, United are looking to sign players who, in Jason Wilcox's own words, could plug and play in the Premier League.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha fit that bill perfectly and have arguably been two of United's best performers this season. Mateta would be a transfer straight out of that playbook and considering how much of a nuisance he has been for the Eagles against United, few would complain about him moving to Old Trafford.",
      "At Selhurst Park, he produced one of the more commanding centre-forward displays United have faced this season. Matthijs de Ligt, who has been so dependable for Ruben Amorim this season, really struggled against Mateta.",
      "That's not to mention how he is already familiar with the 3-4-2-1 system so adapting to what Amorim would ask of him should be straightforward. There is a catch though and it is to do with his price tag.",
      "Reports suggested in the summer Palace rejected bids in the region of £50m from Champions League clubs to keep him. Such a price tag is what United will now expect to pay in January or in the summer for Mateta if they do not need to add a striker to their ranks this winter.",
      "That valuation, for a player who turns 29 in June is too much and not how Ineos would look to spend their transfer budget available to them. So, if United are to sign Mateta, they would need to negotiate that figure down significantly.",
      "Experience in the Premier League does cost money and United are crying out for some of it in their forward line. Sesko has plenty of potential but he needs someone who he can share responsibilities with.",
      "But splashing £50m on a player with little to no resale value is not the answer and thus this no-brainer transfer could be out of their hands in January.",

      "Ruben Amorim is keen for Manchester United to strengthen their squad in January, but he has made the conditions of any deal clear. It's why this window may well pass without anything happening.",
      "The Portuguese head coach has readily talked about the \"mistakes\" of the past when it comes to recruitment and it's why he's keen to avoid any short-term deals this month if possible. The names of Odion Ighalo and Wout Weghorst spring to mind when considering January windows of the past.",
      "But there's no doubt United have put themselves in a position where it might be wise to roll the dice this month. They are firmly in the battle for a Champions League place next season, an outcome that could be crucial in accelerating their progress under Amorim.",
      "Their form hasn't always been convincing, but it's been good enough to show signs of improvement from last season and with inconsistencies clear beyond the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa, there is an opportunity there.",
      "Speaking before United's defeat at Villa in December, Amorim said the club would try to do business this month, but that the focus would be on recruiting players who can have a long-term influence.",
      "\"We’ll see. The only thing that we know is that we only would try to bring players that we think that is going to be the future. It's not going to be to save something in this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for AFCON,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not going to be like that, even if we try to bring one player, maybe it's not the position that is more that we need more. We will try to bring now – and in the end of the season – players that is part that they are perfect for our future.",
      "\"So I don't know what is going to happen, but it's possible that we can do something.\"",
      "When Amorim made those comments, it pointed towards a January move for Antoine Semenyo, whose £65million release clause at Bournemouth has made his mid-season exit a formality. United were keen on a deal but it looks like the 25-year-old is set for a move to Manchester City instead.",
      "The fact that United wanted to sign an attacker in Semenyo but had no alternative in that position explains their January strategy. This was an opportunity that presented itself, rather than fixing a desperate need within the squad.",
      "However, if there is an area that needs strengthening this month, it is in midfield, especially with Bruno Fernandes currently sidelined. There are question marks over the future of all of Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are keen to overhaul their midfield in the summer and will move for at least two new players, with Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson all of interest to them. There appears to be little chance of any coming this month, although Baleba has had a difficult campaign at Brighton.",
      "Instead, United's best approach in midfield might be looking at a more low-key signing, but still someone who will have a part to play beyond the end of this season. Ruben Neves could be available from Al-Hilal and they have monitored Bournemouth duo Tyler Adams and Alex Scott.",
      "With Casemiro out of contract in the summer, Mainoo struggling for minutes under Amorim, Ugarte falling out of favour and Fernandes making noises about his own future, it could yet turn into a year for a significant overhaul in central midfield, so making a start on that in January might be wise.",
      "There are likely to be exits this month as well. Joshua Zirkzee has featured in all of the last seven Premier League games, but he is struggling to make an impact and Roma are very keen on doing a deal for him. If that is either a permanent deal or includes an obligation to buy, then it makes sense, as it's hard to see the Dutchman surviving for much longer at Old Trafford.",
      "Tyrell Malacia made his first appearance for United in 11 months on Boxing Day, but his days also appear to be numbered. The reversion to a back four could theoretically give him more opportunities, but Luke Shaw can play that role, as could Patrick Dorgu, while Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui can fill in. Malacia was in the bomb squad in the summer and needs a move this month.",
      "Then there is Mainoo. The 20-year-old has suffered an untimely calf injury at a point when he might well have finally started a game this season. Amorim reverted to a three-man midfield against Newcastle and that opens up more chances for the academy graduate.",
      "Mainoo isn't expected to be out for long and Amorim has urged him to stay and fight for his place. However, Mainoo needs to play more football than the 212 Premier League minutes he has managed this season. His development has stalled while the likes of Baleba, Wharton and Anderson have surpassed him. The only way to change that is by playing.",
      "As unpalatable as it might be, if his fortunes don't change then he should be sent on loan in January. Napoli are keen to sign him and six months playing in a Serie A title race and in the Champions League, while being coached by Antonio Conte, could be a vital spell in his development.",

      "Well it took a little over 12 hours but we have already seen our first managerial departure from the Premier League in 2026. Enzo Maresca and Chelsea's parting was not a shock. Since the draw with Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, speculation has been mounting regarding the Italian's future.",
      "It was initially believed Maresca would be given until later in January to turn around Chelsea's form but the decision was accelerated to a point where he has left before his team's first game of the year at Manchester City. Ultimately it was a disappointing end for Maresca but he is unlikely to lose too much sleep over it.",
      "Chelsea will have granted him a sizeable severance package while also freeing him from one of the toughest manager/boardroom relationships in European football. The Blues will now move onto another head coach who will be given 18 months or two years before feeling the burning desire to leave.",
      "But perhaps the more interesting fallout from this decision, especially for Manchester United, surrounds what happens to Maresca now. As mentioned, the Stamford Bridge gig remains an impossible job so Maresca will exit it with his reputation largely intact.",
      "He delivered the Conference League, which was the least he could do, but more impressively followed it up with the Club World Cup. Not only that, he has managed to take a team who barely had a pre-season to fifth in the Premier League having been out of the Champions League conversation until last year.",
      "When these achievements are set out, you start to wonder whether it ramps up the pressure on Ruben Amorim. Maresca arrived at Chelsea four months before Amorim joined United and while that extra time with his players in the summer was a big advantage, the improvements he made in west London are more stark than what the Portuguese head coach has managed in the north west.",
      "There is a school of thought that the job was trickier for Amorim than Maresca, but the Italian has implemented his style quicker. Now he is available, it would be interesting to know Jason Wilcox's thoughts.",
      "The United sporting director worked with Maresca at City when they were both focused on the academy so the relationship between the two does exist. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is also known to be a fan of the model City have created for themselves hence why Omar Berrada joined Wilcox at United.",
      "If there comes a point where the feeling is that United are struggling to improve as quickly as necessary, the question has to be asked as to whether or not Amorim is still the right man for the club. It is much easier to stick by your appointment when the alternatives are worse but when Maresca is available, suddenly switching becomes more of an enticing prospect.",
      "Does this mean Amorim's job is in immediate danger? No. There is still plenty of goodwill towards the United head coach and there is not currently a push to see him leave.",
      "But, now there is a clear alternative for United, Amorim could start to feel the heat a touch more as he continues his quest to turn the club's fortunes around. Maresca is willing to work under the head coach model too which also stands him in good stead should United wish to appoint him in the future.",
      "All Amorim can do is continue to show further improvements as the season progresses if he wishes to ensure Maresca's availability becomes a non-factor. But this is just another added pressure for the Reds' head coach to contend with.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "The switch to a back four had never been off the table for Amorim, as he explained in his pre-match press conference. However, the move was delayed as he sought to teach his players his methods.",
      "\"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" Amorim explained. \"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\" But perhaps more interesting was Amorim's comment on the back four.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said, and that could set alarm bells ringing for the players who have played well in his 3-4-3 system.",
      "Amad has been excellent since Amorim arrived. Having played as a No.10 in the 2024/25 season, Amorim pushed the forward to the right wing-back role and he has excelled.",
      "The Ivorian is the best wing-back option at Old Trafford, even with Patrick Dorgu's form starting to show signs of improvement. In his absence, it made sense to move to a back four. If Amorim sticks with a back four, it could be bad news for Amad.",
      "In a 4-2-3-1 system, Amad could not drop further back to play as a full-back. If you were to pick out one criticism in his game as a wing-back, it would be his struggles defensively. He is good enough in an attacking sense to warrant starting as a wing back, but a traditional full-back role is far more reserved.",
      "You would need to push Amad further forward if he were to start. But for a team currently stressing over their squad depth, the quality attacking options starts to become stacked.",
      "Amad would be fighting for a place in the three alongside Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha. One will have to drop to the bench and there's a chance it could be Amad.",
      "There is no reason to panic for Amad and considering he is in brilliant form at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) there's every chance he regains his place upon his return to England. But if Amorim sticks with the 4-2-3-1 formation, Amad might not be the automatic starter he has been so far under Amorim.",

      "The thesis on what has gone wrong at Manchester United over the past dozen years or so could make War and Peace look like a children's book, but if there is one area in particular that can be held up as a costly failure, it is recruitment. A failure of joined-up thinking and a lack of diligence have resulted in hundreds of millions being wasted on players who are not up to the task.",
      "In terms of on-pitch success, recruitment is the biggest differential. It explains why United have fallen so far in recent years, but is there light at the end of the tunnel? This year hints at brighter times ahead, and a £245million spending spree across two transfer windows has delivered value.",
      "The £1.5million deal to sign Ayden Heaven in January looks like a steal, and while the jury has been out on the £25million addition of Patrick Dorgu in the same window, he has had his best games for the club in the past week and scored his first goal on Boxing Day.",
      "The summer saw around £218million spent, with Senne Lammens, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arriving. Lammens has been installed as the first-choice goalkeeper after an £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp and has started encouragingly, and Mbeumo has been a revelation after his £71million switch from Brentford.",
      "Cunha is starting to deliver on a consistent basis after his £62.5million move from Wolves, and there have been flashes from Sesko, who is 22 and learning a new league after joining from RB Leipzig for £73million.",
      "That success rate offers encouragement that things are looking up at Old Trafford, with Jason Wilcox now installed as director of football and Ruben Amorim's side starting to deliver on the pitch. Amorim attributes the recruitment to a bit of luck, but also explained that it was now a more collaborative process and that he wasn't just getting his own way.",
      "That is something Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been trying to change since taking charge of football operations after his minority investment, bemoaning the approach of letting managers sign the players they want before then changing the manager and appointing someone with a different style.",
      "\"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason and the board has another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager, because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything. But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player will not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "United have ramped up their data department since Ratcliffe's investment, but as well as crunching the numbers, they are also putting in the work to discover a potential signing's background, and for all the success so far of the recruits under Amorim, he is demanding more from his new boys.",
      "\"We try to make all the assessments of how they live, how they train, the characteristics,\" he said. \"I think we did well but I think they have more to give.",
      "\"If you talk about Cunha, for example, Ayden is a young guy, Cunha and Bryan are our league, so it's easier for them to perform.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford, and the Reds could have the perfect opportunity to scout a possible replacement when they take on Wolves in the Premier League tonight.",
      "Casemiro has been an integral figure for United in recent years following his big-money switch from Real Madrid in the summer of 2022. He has amassed over 140 appearances across all competitions, scoring 21 goals and registering 13 assists in that time.",
      "However, his influence has waned somewhat and, this time last year, there was widespread pundit and supporter theory his \"legs had gone.\" There were suggestions he was no longer able to cope with the pace and power of the Premier League, prompting calls for United to move on and look ahead to the future.",
      "That said, this season has looked vastly different for the midfielder, as he has enjoyed something of a revival this calendar year. He stepped-up in the second half of last season, and he has been something of an ever-present in the squad this term, apart from having to sit out on two occasions due to suspension.",
      "Whether his upturn in form is enough to prolong the 33-year-old's United career remains to be seen. Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season, although the club do have an option to extend that deal by a further 12 months should they wish.",
      "It's no secret United are in the market for midfield reinforcements, likely looking ahead to life beyond Casemiro - and potentially even Bruno Fernandes - who also faces an uncertain long-term future with the club. Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba was heavily linked during the summer window, but a move failed to come to fruition as United instead prioritised strengthening other areas of the pitch.",
      "Crystal Palace and England star Adam Wharton is also expected to be on the move in the next couple of transfer windows, with a number of top European clubs circling. Nottingham Forest player Elliot Anderson has also been a revelation since his move to the City Ground and has been linked with United in recent months.",
      "Another slightly more left-field option for United is Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes. It was reported by Fabrizio Romano last month that the 24-year-old Brazilian is one of the names now under consideration at Old Trafford.",
      "Still, this evening's meeting between the clubs could be the perfect opportunity for United to get a closer look at the midfielder if they wish to weigh up a possible move next month. Gomes did not feature for his club when they faced the Reds earlier this month at Molineux, as he was serving a suspension.",
      "He joined Wolves from Brazilian side Flamengo back in January 2023, and he has already amassed over 100 appearances across all competitions. In that time, Gomes has scored seven goals and registered four assists.",
      "Gomes typically starts in midfield alongside compatriot Andre, although he will have to anchor the midfield without his usual partner this evening at Old Trafford. That's because Andre picked up his fifth booking of the season last time out against Liverpool and will have to sit this game out - due to suspension.",
      "This will no doubt be a significant test for Gomes, especially if he hopes to catch the eye of any would-be suitors ahead of the transfer market re-opening.",

Amorim switched shape for the first time as head coach in the Boxing Day win against Newcastle and could stick with it against Wolves.",
      "After showing signs of flexibility for the first time in his 14 months in charge at Old Trafford, Amorim suggested a back four would be for life and not just Christmas, even when key men return over the next few weeks.",
      "Amorim shifted shape with Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away on international duty, while injuries have mounted with Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes all on the treatment table. But Amorim insisted he had always planned to evolve during his time in charge and only resisted doing so until now to avoid giving the impression he had caved to media pressure.",
      "He has played the 3-4-2-1 shape, which he had success with in Portugal, almost constantly at United, and felt it was important to use that system to bed in the principles he wants to instil at the club.",
      "\"First of all, it's a process. When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim. \"We are trying to build an identity.",
      "\"Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players and we need to adapt, but they already know and understand why we are changing. It is not because of the pressure of you guys [in the media], or of the fans, it's because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same.\"",
      "Amorim has often stressed that, regardless of the shape, the principles of play will remain the same for his side. However, having finally moved away from a wing-back system, a back four that supporters have been crying out for might be seen more often as his tenure enters a new phase.",
      "That flexibility will also present more headaches to opponents. Newcastle were confused to see United set up in a back four on Boxing Day and took their time to work out what they needed to change.",
      "\"We can change the system and I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve,\" he said.",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "Manchester United teenage defender Ayden Heaven will not be switching international allegiances from England to Ghana, according to reports this week.",
      "The 19-year-old, formerly of Arsenal, signed for the Red Devils for a nominal fee at the start of the year and made a handful of senior appearances towards the tail end of last season. He made his first-team debut in March in a Europa League clash against Real Sociedad.",
      "This term, Heaven has made several Premier League appearances, five of which have been starts. He recently played the full 90 minutes in a narrow defeat against Aston Villa, and featured against Newcastle on Boxing Day, where he was named the Premier League Player of the Match as Amorim's side kept a rare clean sheet.",
      "So far, the teenager has represented England at various youth levels and earned his first call-up to the Under-20s side in the autumn. He was not selected for the November international break due to injury, but is likely to be included in one of the squads when international football resumes in the spring.",
      "Despite being born in London, Heaven also qualifies to represent Ghana through a grandparent, and his development has understandably been monitored. Under current FIFA rules, players can switch national teams provided they have played no more than three competitive senior games before the age of 21, have not featured in the latter stages of an international tournament and as long as three years have passed since their last senior appearance.",
      "According to the BBC, Heaven will not be switching allegiances to represent Ghana, with the World Cup fast approaching. Although Ghana did not qualify for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, they did book their place at next summer's tournament in the United States and have been drawn in a group with England, Croatia and Panama.",
      "The article notes that Heaven wants to represent England at senior level and force his way into the first-team squad, a feat he will surely achieve so long as he continues on an upward trajectory at United.",
      "Heaven has earned the praise of manager Ruben Amorim this season, with the Portuguese coach highlighting the youngster's attitude and application in training. \"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" he told the media recently.",
      "\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game.",
      "\"He trained really well. If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "United return to action on Tuesday night with their final match of 2025 at home against Wolves. They will then start the new year with an away trip to Leeds this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "For at least the 27th time in his still relatively brief Manchester United reign, Ruben Amorim has turned a corner only to find himself down another blind alley.",
      "Becoming only the third Premier League team to come away from a game with Wolves carrying anything less than three points in their back pocket would be mortifying enough if it hadn’t come on the back of a win over Newcastle that had some giddy sorts even talking up unlikely title tilts.",
      "Eventually, we will all learn that there is no such thing as good form or bad form at Man United. They are just a bunch of stuff that happens. And also that lad is never, ever getting a haircut.",
      "But what of the manager? If Amorim is done for, the next question becomes who could take over at Manchester United? We have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until after the summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund boss was high in the reckoning for the Tottenham job, mostly we suspect because he is available. The same criteria could get him the nod here, and it’s fair to say that former Dortmund bosses have generally done okay in Our League.",
      "",
      "Whispers of Fulham being unhappy in their marriage were as fleeting as they were ridiculous. Silva would likely be a decent Manchester United manager, but we struggle with the optics of this one. United fancy themselves to be rather above Silva.",
      "",
      "Figures high in the betting for any big Premier League job, but is in the middle of one of those absolutely terrible runs of results that he can get away with at Bournemouth but would absolutely have to cut out if he wants the hassle of Big Six management.",
      "You can’t be going 10 games without a win when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "",
      "He has somehow made Aston Villa the third best Premier League team of 2025 while battling PSR issues. He probably deserves another crack at a massive club, if he can be arsed with the pressure.",
      "We can see this one happening.",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an ‘interesting’ club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "Absolutely everything about Michael Carrick suggests he should be a very good football manager indeed. A thoughtful player – most notably of course for Man United themselves, which always helps – and now a thoughtful pundit. Unfortunately the bit in between where he was actually a football manager was less good.",

      "",
      "That FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has taken the Austrian high up all the lists, and now right to the very top of the two silliest of all. Seems harsh on him, really. In the specific case of this silly club, it helps that he plays the same system as Manchester United. Or maybe it doesn’t, who knows any more.",

      "The Mailbox is fed up with Chelsea’s ‘f***ing incompetent morons’, who ‘desperately need’ to appoint one of four alternatives to Liam Rosenior…",
      "Man Utd should appoint Martin O’Neill with Ruben Amorim reaching the end of the line at Old Trafford in your first Mailbox of the new year.",
      "Xavi fancies a Premier League job but his conditions appear… unrealistic. The other two in the top three might never return to the dug out.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is at breaking point with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim looking to sell him ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports."

      "According to reports, Antoine Semenyo had an ‘agreement’ with Manchester United, but he decided to pull the plug on a move over a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, grabbing nine goals and three assists in his 18 appearances for Bournemouth.",
      "The talented winger has been a key player for Bournemouth for a couple of years, but he has taken his performances to another level this term and has earned admiring glances from other clubs.",
      "In recent weeks, it has emerged that every Big Six club have expressed their interest in signing Semenyo, with this competition and his £65m release clause making a January transfer inevitable.",
      "Man City and Man Utd were said to be the leading contenders for his signature, but it has emerged that he has opted for a move to the Eithad and a deal is likely to be completed in the next few days.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Man City v Chelsea, Man United, Andoni Iraola, Rodrigao Bentinha, La Liga returns",
      "On Thursday evening, a report claimed there had been a ‘breakthrough in negotiations’ between Man City and Bournemouth, who have now reached an ‘agreement’ over Semenyo.",
      "This is a blow for Man Utd, who need to sign another quality option or two in attacking areas to provide extra competition.",
      "United are currently overly reliant on Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, who signed instead of Semenyo in the summer.",
      "A report from journalist Duncan Castles claims Man Utd actually had an ‘agreement’ with Semenyo over persoanl terms, but this deal fell through as the winger ‘took exception to’ a ‘lowball offer’.",
      "“As we discussed in the podcast in September, Ruben Amorim met Semenyo in person to assess his character,” Castles said on the Transfers Podcast.",
      "“United had agreed personal terms with the player only for Semenyo to discover that their salary offer to him was significantly less than what they’d given Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“This allowed Bournemouth to persuade the player to sign a new contract with a release clause.”",
      "Castles has also revealed when Semenyo is likely to complete his move from Bournemouth to Man City.",
      "“I understand that Bournemouth expect to keep the player for the next two games,” Castles added.",
      "“The clause is valid for the first 10 days of January only, and they’re running it to the end of the clause before allowing him to go to another club.”",
      "He continued: “Pretty much all the top clubs in the Premier League have tried to exploit [Semenyo’s release clause].",
      "“Manchester United came back in. Chelsea enquired. Liverpool looked at time. Tottenham made an offer and failed again because he decided Manchester City was the most attractive club to move to.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo’s move to Manchester City is reportedly ‘agreed’, while Pep Guardiola’s side are also ‘in talks’ to sign Liverpool target Marc Guehi.",
      "According to reports, ‘three major reasons’ have prevented Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo from joining Liverpool in next month’s transfer window.",
      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "Man City are ‘closing in on a full agreement’ for Antoine Semenyo with Liverpool not expected to make a late move for the Bournemouth forward.",
      "Former Liverpool man Jermaine Pennant thinks it’s “really stupid” that the Reds haven’t put themselves in the position to sign Antoine Semenyo.",
      "Bournemouth ‘expect’ Antoine Semenyo’s transfer to Manchester City to be completed within the next 48 hours, according to reports."

      "There is some significant jostling for position going on now, with Chelsea throwing a spanner in the works by axeing Enzo Maresca, who had been a relative outsider to be the next out despite his increasingly perplexing post-match musings.",
      "There is now a new frontrunner. Well, we say new – both he and his current club have already been at the head of this market in different lives this season.",
      "Arne Slot has had a few wins to get him out of immediate Mo Salah-instigated danger, but Newcastle’s failure to launch this season, Tottenham’s baffling home-away dichotomy and winless runs at Burnley and Bournemouth are all causing significant ripples.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they end 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they have somehow just about stayed in range of Arsenal at the summit.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should arbitrary position has been handed to them this week. But you still don’t want to find yourself right at the bottom of that group, do you? Having to accept that technically so far this season you’ve actually been worse than Spurs?",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top was very real indeed.",
      "But instead, they haven’t kicked on at all. Their only wins in the last six games, all of which were winnable, have come against Burnley. It’s emblematic of a season stubbornly refusing to get going and could yet prove costly for Howe.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Five wins from the last seven have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that he or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But could really, really do with starting another of the ‘Champions League form’ runs quite soon. A second December draw against Chelsea could be the start of something, but they urgently need a win. Arsenal as the first game of 2026 isn’t ideal; Dr Tottenham straight after it absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs. Although losing an actual Premier League match to someone as ropey as Spurs was also quite careless.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "We didn’t have to wait long for the first Big Six manager departure of 2026, and there are significant whispers that we could be in something of a London bus situation.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim has turned another corner and ended up down a blind alley. Could he really be done for at Man United? And if so, who’s next?",
      "Thomas Frank has tested the patience of bored Tottenham fans once more with a drab 0-0 draw at his old club. Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "A draw at Brentford is a good result for pretty much anybody this season, but the way Thomas Frank did it moved him closer to the edge at Spurs than ...",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed his verdict on whether the Premier League giants will make “changes” in this month’s transfer window.",
      "The Mailbox is fed up with Chelsea’s ‘f***ing incompetent morons’, who ‘desperately need’ to appoint one of four alternatives to Liam Rosenior…",

      "We are now deep in the most Barclays period of any season, a time where games apparently take place every day and nobody actually knows who they’re playing until the game begins or indeed what day it is or why it’s a team they only played three weeks ago.",
      "It’s just games. And then some more games. Just Our League forever and ever and ever. It is the most wonderful time of the year and don’t ask too many questions about why so many of the games seem to be low-effort, low-tempo, low-quality 0-0 draws. Don’t worry about that at all, okay?",
      "We’ve double-checked the calendar and this next bunch of games definitely take place on a weekend. We’ve double-checked their size and confirmed they are large. It is with great confidence, therefore, that we present the latest Big Weekend.",
      "",
      "It already was, probably, before the Enzo Maresca business blew up. We do rather admire the man. If the rumours are true and he really did try and use reported interest from Man City to coax an improved contract out of notorious manager-killers Chelsea, then that is rather wonderful.",
      "You’ve already been there 18 months, man! Look at the history! You’re already an ancient, decrepit manager on borrowed time by Chelsea standards!",
      "Anyway, he’s gone now. We’re not sure it will make Chelsea any better or worse in the long run. He’s never really felt like he’s that important a figure there, frankly. Neither conspicuous problem nor compelling solution.",
      "Now Chelsea have to decide what happens next. Do they double-down on their unique approach to the game? Or do they abandon the experiment altogether after throwing eye-wateringly vast sums of money at it?",
      "And in the meantime, a nice soothing trip to Manchester City to keep things ticking over. That should be easy enough, shouldn’t it?",
      "City’s title-sniffing winning run is over after being held to a goalless draw at Sunderland. But all the great and good get held to a draw at Sunderland these days.",
      "There was little sense of wheels falling off, but it does leave City precious little wriggle room here. They can’t now really afford to be handing more ground to the galloping Gunners and must cash in on any confusion or lack of focus under, as far as know at this point, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane.",
      "",
      "Your man is never, ever getting that haircut, is he? After victory against Newcastle, it appeared but a formality for United’s win counter to tick along to two via a home game against a Wolves side that was losing to absolutely everyone, including 4-1 at home to Man United just a few weeks ago.",
      "But the thing we’re all coming to realise with Manchester United is that what has gone before – even if it’s only a week or three ago – has quite simply no bearing whatsoever on what will happen next.",
      "There is no such thing as good form or bad form with United. You can’t extrapolate anything from anything they do. They simply are.",
      "Sometimes they’ll play quite well and win rather impressively. Sometimes they’ll battle to a result that shows plenty of fight and spirit. Sometimes they’ll lose narrowly to a better team. Sometimes they’ll lose badly to a worse team.",
      "And sometimes they’ll fail to beat a Wolves team that had two points all season.",
      "Ruben Amorim didn’t invent this version of Manchester United. All their recent managers have been capable of confidently turning corners that lead directly down another drab cul-de-sac. Especially Erik Ten Hag, but especially Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But Amorim has now perfected the art. Instead of a buoyant United side with a couple of festive wins under their belts, this is now once again a reduced and uncertain Man United. And they must now head across the Pennines to face a Leeds side who actually have turned a corner in recent weeks and struck upon something that works in a six-game unbeaten runs featuring a win over Chelsea and now a pair of draws against Liverpool.",
      "Does feel like Leeds should probably sort Man United out good and proper this weekend. Which probably means Man United will actually win 4-1.",
      "",
      "Even by Bournemouth-under-Iraola standards of streak, this season is lurching towards the preposterous.",
      "We all know that Bournemouth’s schtick is to either be the best team in the country or the worst at any given time. But they really are pushing it this season.",
      "The run of five wins and three draws in eight games (after an unfortunate opening defeat to Liverpool at Anfield before everyone knew that was quite bad) that lifted Bournemouth all the way up to third in the table now feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "It’s now been 10 games without a win since a 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest back in October, and it’s fair to say Arsenal aren’t the side you’d necessarily choose to face to try and bring a 10-game winless run to an end.",
      "There’s better news ahead, because after that it’s Dr Tottenham and they are 100 per cent the very team you’d choose to try and bring an 11-game winless run to an end.",
      "But it does seem likely to get worse before it gets better for Iraola. And he’s also just clearly got this whole thing backwards too.",
      "Had Bournemouth started badly and then hit their stride he would be a solid favourite for all three of the either definitely or feasibly available Big Six jobs at this time. The bad run at the start of the season would have been attributed entirely to losing his entire defence in the summer and explained away far more easily than it is now this run of despair has come after he’s already proved he didn’t actually need all those brilliant defenders at all actually.",
      "With Antoine Semenyo’s departure also now imminent, it’s an odd old time for a manager who should be looking at the next step up the career ladder having done all kinds of brilliant things in his current job, but who might instead soon find himself coming under actual pressure in his current role having watched Bournemouth slip right down into and now out the back of the great fog of mediocrity that is this season’s Premier League mid-table peloton.",
      "",
      "Never has the disconnect between a manager and fanbase been more transparent than at Brentford v Tottenham last night.",
      "Tottenham left with precisely what they intended to – a clean sheet and a precious point in their noble quest for an 11th-placed finish. But that is not at all what the fans want or expect or consider an acceptable target.",
      "A point at Brentford is not a bad result for anyone this season. We’re halfway through the season and the only visiting team to win there this season is Man City, and that was a tense and tight 1-0 win.",
      "The result is fine. The manner of it not so much. Most Spurs fans would have settled for a point last night; but they will not settle for playing only for that point and showing neither the Dare nor the Do to strive for anything more.",
      "That is what Thomas Frank still doesn’t grasp, and why last night’s draw might actually be his most damaging result yet. Because it highlights the gulf that exists between him and fans who spent the entire game singing for lost heroes from Dele to Christian Eriksen and Mousa Dembele. Even Eric Dier’s song got an airing as, of course, did Brennan Johnson’s. Along with more than one refrain of Boring, Boring Tottenham.",
      "The fans were clear and unanimous in their displeasure – and this is the away fans Thomas Frank has previously praised in contrast to those mean home ones who make it impossible for his players to beat even Wolves at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "But in Frank’s mind, the trip to Brentford represented a job well done.",
      "It also represented the first time since the disastrous trip to Arsenal in November that he had paired Rodrigo Bentancur and Joao Palhinha in midfield, adding a layer of nonsense atop that cement-mixer of a midfield by asking a third defensive midfielder in Archie Gray to play as a kind of false 10.",
      "All three are good players. All three are perfectly valid and useful members of Spurs’ squad. They absolutely do not and cannot together constitute a viable midfield three.",
      "We’ve said before and we’ll say again that Palhinha and Bentancur specifically are an either/or proposition.",
      "But Spurs simply don’t have the numbers and their manager lacks the inclination to gamble.",
      "With Lucas Bergvall, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski, Pape Sarr and Xavi Simons all still unavailable for assorted reasons this weekend, we fully expect to see Bentinha once again in dreary harness in Spurs’ midfield against Sunderland.",
      "Except this time it’s at home. And it won’t just be 1700 travelling Spurs fans voicing their displeasure at the sheer indignity of it all.",
      "",
      "Coventry’s serene march to the Premier League has encountered a minor bump in the road after a run of two wins, three draws and two defeats in the last seven games, but the good news for Frank Lampard and the lads is that nobody else is making a compelling case of stepping up to put any pressure on the leaders.",
      "One team with lofty ambitions to do so would be Birmingham, but after a run of four wins in six games up to the start of last month it’s now seven games without a win after a painful 3-0 defeat at Watford on New Year’s Day.",
      "",
      "La Liga is back, back, back after its Christmas break, with a local derby in Barcelona the headline act.",
      "Espanyol have their own interests too – they get back under way in fifth place and two points behind fourth-placed Villarreal – but certainly won’t mind putting a spanner in Barcelona’s title-cruising works either."

      "",
      "Amorim is the WORST Manchester United manager in 40 years. It’s not even close. People very often say since 2013 we have been crap, but we have never been this crap. We had never finished below 8th. We always challenged for the cups at least if nothing. We made a half hearted attempt at top 4. We didn’t lose to some of the worst teams to grace the Premier League. There is a period between 2013 & till Ten Hag left, and then there is this.",
      "If Amorim won his next 14 games IN A ROW, he will still be 1 win off matching David Moyes’ record at MUFC. That is an abolsutely shocking stastic. His formation is rubbish, his man management is rubbish. He is using Manchester United as work experience to learn on the job, and waste our time, effort & money. Losing to Grimsby & [drawing versus] this Wolves team in the same season is a sackable offence 10 out of 10 times. But the board will never learn. They keep hiring “up and comers” in managers, in strikers, in defense, in everything. Hoping to find a gem in a pile of horseshit, but what we are left with is just horseshit.",
      "I want Amorim to succeed, I want Manchester United to succeed. But he looks so far out of his depth, that I honestly feel 90% of the mailbox, including raigbater champion Stewie would make a better manager at MUFC. It’s that bad. Chatgpt would make better decisions. The whole job of a manager is to have good tactics & plans, manage the players, have an eye for what will work. He knows none of that. He is an embarrassment to the club and just football in general.",
      "This is a manager who was so scared of what the media will say, he preferred to lose playing 3-5-2 rather than change it to 4 at the back and win. In his own words. He is so clueless from day 1 that he himself feels 75% of his decisions were wrong.",
      "These are signs of a weak, fragile & clueless man. I will always hope the manager succeeds, but I can’t help but be frustrated. We couldnt beat fuckin WOLVES!!! And they honestly had the much better chances and should have won. It’s that bad. And all the Amorim supporters say “give him time”… it’s been 60+ games!! If you wanna back him, fair enough. But let’s not be blinded by saying this is the version of Amorim that will ever succeed. He needs to change EVERYTHING about himself, his tactics, his mindset, his knowledge, his attitude and maybe then he will have a chance.

      "His football was awful to watch and stifled exciting players. He’d come up with a tactical masterpiece once every 20 games (PSG, Arsenal), but that’s not good enough.",
      "Now the grass is most certainly not greener. Liam Rosenior could become a great manager, but Chelsea can’t replace one project manager with another. If he does poorly he’s out by the end of the season. If he does ok, he will be given 18 months at most.",
      "Chelsea need an experienced manager, with discipline to guide this young team. A better manager than Maresca is out there (Xavi, Folioli, Ireola, Glasner) and Cheslea desperately need someone in that frame.",
      "They won’t hire any of those though, because Egbahli, Winstanley and Laurence are all f**king incompetent morons. I don’t mention Boehly here (although he doesn’t seem like the sharpest knife), because all the decision making over the last 18 months seems to have been done by the brain society of E,W&L.",

      "",
      "Happy new year! There appears to be a lot of face saving and revisionism from Chelsea fans now, and dare I say it a divide in the fan base, so I want to kind of set the record straight and use only facts to discuss the sacking of Enzo Maresca.",
      "David Ornstein is reporting that back in October, Maresca told the Chelsea board he was already in discussions with Man City about replacing Pep. Then he was doing the same again, a second round of negotiations in December. That is a manager who has had his head turned. Would that be accepted by a fanbase if it was a player? Let’s ask Liverpool FC supporters and Trent Alexander Arnold.",
      "So Maresca isn’t focussed fully on Chelsea at this point. And that appears to have found its way to the dressing room, where he conceivably lost the players confidence and trust. Results have been pretty good since though… no? Oh. No.",
      "Then there is the argument that Maresca wasn’t backed by the Chelsea owners/board. The facts of the matter are he asked for Man City academy products who he knew. He was behind the signings of Palmer (thankfully!), Delap, Tosin and Sancho’s loan. He also asked for Dewsbury Hall, and duly received. On top of this he was handed young players capable of developing into world class talent. Yet he has appeared completely incapable of coaching a defence or improving any individual. His greatest successes in respect of individual players are Robert Sanchez now making fewer mistakes and Reece James being injury free for a year. That’s pretty much it.",
      "There are Chelsea fans saying that Maresca wasn’t given time. He had 18 months. Maresca was the tenth longest serving Premier League manager when the bell chimed on his final minute in charge.",
      "Finally we have the “he had to rotate to keep everyone happy” argument. And Chelsea’s bloated squad is the reason behind the rotation. A reminder then, that in every single competition Chelsea play in, they are bound by the same squad size limits as every other team. They are not trying to give 60 different players minutes in the Premier League. It’s just not a thing. Chelsea have used 25 different players in the Premier League. The same number as Man United, Wolves, Brighton and Sunderland. One player more than Arsenal and Man City. Yet Chelsea have made the most changes to their starting 11.",
      "Maresca’s stubborn refusal to find/use a consistent lineup or even consistent spine ultimately led to Chelsea lacking consistency until his final breath, as it were.",
      "His greatest win is undoubtedly the club World Cup success. A genuine display of tactical awareness caught even me off guard, in a final where we out PSG’d PSG. But an end of season cup competition where Maresca could consistently play his best team, with the fewest changes to each starting line up… well, that’s there for all to see isn’t it. Consistency breeds consistency.",
      "He was given time, he was given players he asked for, he was provided opportunity and he fluttered his eyelashes at Man City at the nearest opportunity.",

So yes, it is extremely significant that spurs have sold Brennan Johnson for a reasonable price instead of holding onto an unrealistic valuation and letting his value decline over time.",
      "An article about this doesn’t need the snide The Lewis Family TM nonsense, both because it really isn’t as clever as Dave thinks it is, but more importantly because pretending the powers behind the throne have always been the same is patently false. The Lewis Family isn’t a single fungible amorphous mass but is instead made up of different people from the same family, and it is clear that the children of Joe Lewis view things very differently from their dad.

      "I used to watch football to be entertained by high pressing with interchangeable midfielders flooding the box and tracking back within the same breath. Fullbacks bombing and kamikaze strikers. And goals — so many goals — like a byproduct of the madness. But thankfully I’ve now evolved to understand that goals mean little, possession is king, and recycling play is how players add to their statistical values that tell you how well they will perform in a computer a year from now even if they look a bit lacking using those prehistoric inventions called eyes. A ball delivered into the box is a needless risk. A back pass is still a pass as the team aims for a thousand of them. I finally understand. I am post football. I am enlightened. 2 + 2 = 5.\nNiall, Annapolis",

      "Now, as a Fantasy Football player, I have 3 teams. One, my regular team, I select using my own thoughts, gut instinct, on who is playing well, upcoming fixture difficulty, etc. Another uses some available online AI tools to suggest transfers and who to select for the current game week, and another using my own Python/AI attempt at selecting the team and transfers.",
      "Guess what? My original team is still better. The AI teams look like they are working, mostly make reasonable changes, but sometimes make bonkers ones too.",
      "You also realise just how many variables exist, with what is really a small data set of games and overall information, making it tricky to get it right. I am sure an EPL club can afford better talent and tools, but would still be subject to the same limitations of a small data set. 38 games is just not enough and as teams change dramatically each season (and half season) not sure that past data is as useful. Wondering if Chelsea and Maresca were one of the teams? Might make more sense of some of his seemingly whacky team selections. No?",
      "The other topic was the most recent pronouncement of the KMI (the body that reviews major refereeing decisions and makes a judgement on which were right or wrong.) It all sounds rather important and impactful but is ultimately another cosmetic PR exercise. No real visibility into the process or at least how any outcome of the panel might impact refereeing process changes.",
      "So yet another cul-de-sac in performance accountability of the PGMOL, it seems. Other than some fans getting more pissed when the KMI pronounced that Everton, for example, should have had a penalty in the game they lost 1-0 Arsenal. A decision that could have a huge impact on the final outcome. Certainly end of season earnings.",
      "While the commonly held belief is that these things even out over a season, as mentioned above, there isn’t enough data so it isn’t likely to be true over a 38 game season.",
      "Whether the decisions were right or wrong, those that track impact of VAR either positively or negatively in the last full season showed Newcastle at the top with a +9, while Bournemouth were at the bottom with a -7. And most would recall several times the PGMOL had to apologize to Bournemouth for their errors. So they clearly don’t even out over a season.",

      "The Wolves game was a very frustrating watch, even though I had a feeling they were going to give us a tougher game than the table suggests. At the end of the game the only apt phrase I could think of was, “what the f*ck was that?”. But I’m not here to dissect a (piss) poor performance, these are to be expected when a team is being built – if this was going to be straightforward then we’d already be competing for the big silverware instead of floundering for over a decade. Instead, I am here to assess the progress we have made up to this halfway point of the season i.e. the long-term results.",
      "In terms of our attack, we are showing signs of being up there with the best of them – only Arsenal and City have scored more. The fact that we spent a decent amount of money on our attack in the summer means this is not a coincidence, and the underlying stats (expected goals) help show that the system and style of play is leading to a healthy number of chances being created. It feels like Sesko and Cunha still have gears to find, which is an exciting prospect. The two who have been playing CM have definitely contributed (9 goals and 10 assists between them). Bruno is just doing Bruno, but Casemiro’s form has been a pleasant surprise. In terms of the WBs, Dalot takes a lot of stick at times but he has produced this season (1 goal and 5 assists – just about as good as any other FB/WB in the league), and Dorgu seems to finally be finding his feet in the PL. Our set-pieces have been on point too.",
      "On the flipside, we haven’t been as strong in defence as only 6 teams have conceded more than us. Instinctively I think are we getting caught out of shape too often or is there an issue around the balance of the team. I can’t exactly deep dive into the stats as I don’t work at this for a living but looking at the high level numbers available, the outlier seems to be goals conceded from open play (15 vs 10) and counter attacks (4 vs 1), not set piece goals conceded (9 vs 8) when compared to the average of teams above us (ignoring penalties and OGs which are negligible). Therefore, on the face of it, this suggests Ruby hasn’t got the balance right yet in transition and/or defence.",
      "Interestingly however (for the nerd in me anyway), a comparison can be made with Palace who employ a reasonably similar shape (3 at the back, wingbacks and 2 in CM). They have conceded 9 fewer goals (20) – only 7 of these have come from open play and only 1 on the counterattack, suggesting this type of system can work in terms of defence. So, whether it’s a personnel issue (individual mistakes) and/or a tweak to the system, Ruby would do worse than look to Palace for some of the answers in defence.",
      "Overall, it’s an A for effort in attack but a D in defence. Yet sitting 6th at the halfway point (assuming Sunderland don’t do any damage against City) is not too shabby and would have been acceptable to any supporter at the start of the season. Yes, we could have picked up more points and could be inexplicably sitting second in the table. I could have also won the Euromillions and sunning myself somewhere exotic in the world instead of freezing my xmas walnuts off in a wintery UK. But the universe is not ready for any of those things to happen right now – this is year 1 of a rebuild so be patient and see where we end up and, in the meantime, I’ll keep wasting money on the lottery.\nGarey (one of these days Rodney, we’ll be champions again) Vance, MUFC",

      "On this rather sleepy and flu-filled NY eve an article about MU scouting for a replacement caught my eye (Man Utd ‘begin work on plans’ to replace Ruben Amorim with PL boss ‘leading the race’ – Football365). I found myself half praying this to be true. I don’t want to be that fan that is constantly calling for change, constantly highlighting the managers shortcomings and overlooking their strengths – but it does feel like Amorim’s race is run.",
      "He keeps making the same mistakes; for a copy of the Everton game this season, see the Lyon game from last season. You might argue that we won against Lyon, but it was in spite of the managers decision making, not because of it. His decision to marginalise some of the playing staff is now biting us on the backside – the likes of Zirkzee, Malacia and Mainoo could have been important for this period (i.e. during AFCON) but because they have had virtually no minutes up till now they don’t have the match sharpness or rhythm to their game.",
      "Amorim may well be a good coach, but this job has come too early for him. The fact that he admits he would do 75% of things differently, means he is only getting 25% of things right – that’s not good enough. Especially when you consider this might be one of the best collection of players we have had since Fergie departed, second only to Mourinho’s side. The decision to revert to 3-4-3 felt like a backwards step last night and the performance was evidence of that.",
      "Anyways, in terms of the article, it seems that Glasner is seen as a safe bet. I can see why; he is out of contract soon, he’s won silverware on the continent and at his current club, he knows how to manage the demands of the league and European football, the rhythm and intensity of the PL is not new to him and generally speaking his stock is at an all-time high. If he can bring Guehi along with him that would make the scousers really lose their heads – we would all get a kick out of that.",
      "Another name has recently come to mind as well, a certain Martin O’Neill. I am not sure he is a name that some fans or Sir Jim would approve, but there is something about Martin that reminds me very much of Ferguson. He has had success north of the border, he knows the game and the English league well, he strikes me as being less rigid in the way he see’s the game (certainly when compared to Amorim), at one point in the early 2000’s he was considered as a replacement for the Great Scot himself.\nIbrahim Khalid",
      "",
      "Watching Ruben Amorim’s press conferences lately, I keep thinking less about tactics and more about tone, and not in a good way. Too often, his interviews sound like a manager making excuses instead of setting standards.",
      "It reminds me of a boss I had at McDonald’s. On paper, he was fine. He knew the systems, followed the manual, and checked all the boxes. But his team talks before a rush were dreadful. Everything was framed around what might go wrong, who needed to be careful, and why today would be difficult. You didn’t feel motivated; you felt prepared for failure. Unsurprisingly, shifts with him always felt harder than necessary.",
      "That’s the same feeling Amorim’s media appearances give off. There’s a constant lowering of expectations, a subtle sense of limitation. We’re not quite there, this will be difficult, we must be realistic. Honesty is fine, but elite football isn’t a therapy session. At some point, messaging influences mindset, and mindset affects performance.",
      "People love to say players don’t listen to press conferences. That’s nonsense. They hear the tone, absorb the narrative, and it seeps into the dressing room whether anyone admits it or not. You don’t need Mourinho-era bravado, but you do need conviction. Right now, Amorim often sounds like someone hoping to survive rather than take charge.",
      "At McDonald’s, the difference between a bad shift and a good one was often just a manager who spoke like we could handle it. In football, the margins are thinner, the stakes higher and sounding like you’re already managing the explanation before and after kick-off is rarely the mark of a side about to surprise anyone.\nGaptoothfreak, Man.

      "To go from 15th last season with no real hope to being 6th and actually seeing us play some decent football more often than not is already more progress than any realistic fan could have hoped for this year. We pose a very real attacking threat against anyone even with Sesko not coming to the party. Our build up play and passing is very good in spells and our keeper is a massive upgrade. Our midfield is clearly in need of improvement and our defence is still leaking way too many goals but so what. Last season we were shit with absolutely no hope. This season we are up there just behind the actual decent teams having made some very clear improvement and also having some very clear areas we need to improve.",

      "Very Generous of Johnno to start considering Arteta as being hired because he was what it takes to win it.",
      "Unai Emery isn’t a perfectly decent manager; he’s an excellent manager. He’s Aeons beyond Arteta. £675m net spend in 5 years for Arsenal and only an FA Cup Trophy to show for it. £65m net spend for Villa over the same period, in which Emery has taken a Villa side from battling relegation to top 3 this season and competitive in cup competitions. He’s won trophies at every club he’s been at, including the same trophy with two different clubs; he’s won a championship in France – he’s probably going to win a trophy this season with Villa, albeit it won’t be the league.",
      "Emery took over from a longstanding club legend and improved on the league finish in his first season – look at his squad available to him and the squad available to Arteta – let me know which of those players would get into today’s team. Emery got Arsenal to a European final; Arteta couldn’t even get past Villareal (Emery won it that year with them). Emery should have been given the time that Arteta has been afforded and the transfer budget to match – Arsenal would have likely won considerably more than they have in the last few years.",
      "I’d take Unai Emery at Leeds over Arteta any day of the week.

      "First half villa definitely shaded it in every way. Better chances, defending competently and Martinez winding up the crowd. Marvellous.",
      "The game turned on Arsenal battering our best midfielder in the game (Onana) meaning he had to go off. It’s not a surprise we then struggled in set pieces and lost our defensive screen that was working so well. Arsenal fans booing the referee was genuinely mental. They committed TWICE as many fouls as we did. If we are accused of going down too easily I refer you to Gabriel going down like a sack of spuds in an arial battle with… checks notes… 4’2” Emi Buendia. I saw Benduia in Sainsbury’s once. He’s tiny.",
      "Second half a mistake (another one…) by Martinez let Arsenal in and we struggled after that as it bouyed the home team and the crowd. Small margins and all that Scott Parker nonsense. Arsenal did indeed then ’smell blood’ as Arteta put it and put us to the sword.",
      "Lastly, let’s not forget the background to Arsenal/City/Liverpool/Chelsea. Our bench cost roughly £70 million. Or roughly one Eze. When they have almost another £200m worth of players on the bench it is a mismatch like 90% of the games Arsenal and the others play. Every Villa fan I have spoken to (I don’t deal in social media noise) found the talk of a title challenge either confusing or hilarious. No one took it seriously for this very reason. No one can compete with this, built in, financial imbalance over a whole season. You can point to Leicester but that was 10 years ago and the gap has widened even more considerably since then.",

Most Arsenal attacks have always come from the right side where Saka plays. However, Saka wants to dribble, shoot or pass backwards. In yesterday’s game, Trossard was moving the ball faster and releasing it even faster. No wonder, Villa could not cope with the second half intensity, and Gyokeres was getting service. All the four goals originated from the left hand side. This is the way to break down low-block and stubborn teams. With Saka dilly dallying, the defenders have ample time to close shop.I hope he learns from this game.\nYiembe, Mombasa",

      "This year’s January transfer window is already shaping up to surpass last season’s equivalent, with Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo emerging as the early favourite to be the most expensive signing as a £65m deal nears.",
      "There have also been murmurs of Arsenal and Manchester United doing business if the right opportunities arise, while Spurs are also likely to be active as they are set to recoup £35m after ‘agreeing’ a deal to sell Brennan Johnson, who also has other options, to Crystal Palace.",
      "This will see Tottenham accept a £15m loss on Johnson, who joined the north London outfit via the Harry Kane money as a £50m signing to fill the huge void left by the Bayern Munich superstar.",
      "Johnson overcame an uninspiring debut season to star in Tottenham’s Europa League triumph by scoring some vital goals, but the Welshman, like Dominic Solanke, has been derailed by the summer appointment of Thomas Frank, who has preferred other attackers.",
      "So, with Johnson retaining most of his value but lacking minutes, he is the most obvious candidate to be sold to fund Tottenham’s moves in January and next summer, while the player can benefit from being a bigger fish at a very reputable Premier League club. Really, everybody wins.",
      "And this got us thinking. Theoretically, if the remaining Big Six sides also had to pick one player bought for £50m+ within the last three years to cut ties with to finance their next lot of signings, who would they choose and why? From Arsenal to Manchester United, here is what they should do in this scenario…",
      "",
      "It’s just not working, is it?",
      "Gyokeres was billed as Arsenal’s final piece of the jigsaw when he was supposedly bought to fix Mikel Arteta’s striker problem in the summer, but they are arguably in the same boat as they were without the Swedish international.",
      "The 27-year-old bulldozer scored at a ridiculous rate over two years for Sporting Lisbon, but the Premier League is a completely different level and he has been found out this term.",
      "His tally of five goals in 17 Premier League games is not disastrous on paper, but two of these goals have been penalties and he has only scored once in his last seven outings.",
      "Gyokeres is a different profile from Arsenal’s other strikers, and he is certainly the best finisher inside the box, but he has offered next to nothing in general play and Gabriel Jesus has looked far brighter when replacing him in recent weeks. This will likely also be the case once Kai Havertz is back up to speed.",
      "Arsenal made the biggest statement in the title race so far on Tuesday night by brushing in-form Aston Villa aside to win 4-1, but Gyokeres was the noticeable weak link before he was replaced. He could feasibly end this season as Arteta’s third-choice striker, so the north London outfit would be astute to cut ties before his value declines even further.",

      "",
      "A major hallmark of Todd Boehly’s reign at Stamford Bridge has been Chelsea’s unrelenting insistence on hoarding up-and-coming wingers and ignoring other positions in desperate need of upgrades: a new goalkeeper, centre-back and striker.",
      "This continued in the summer as the Blues brought in Gittens, Estevao and Alejandro Garnacho to fill the squad spots previously occupied by Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke.",
      "In fairness to Chelsea, it is at least the case that the latest batch of wingers are upgrades on last season’s options, but Estevao and Garnacho have certainly outshone Gittens.",
      "Estevao could become something quite special, though it appears that Garnacho also has a higher ceiling than Gittens, who is much further from being the final product than his two teammates, despite being in a similar age bracket.",
      "Chelsea are proven to adopt a cut-throat approach regarding player sales under this regime, with Gittens standing out as the most obvious casualty of their current group of wingers.",

      "",
      "Isak eventually got what he wanted in the summer, but was his move to Liverpool really worth all of that effort?",
      "By resorting to drastic measures to seal his move to Liverpool from Newcastle United, Isak sacrificed pre-season to leave himself playing catch-up with his new teammates and just as he started to show signs of being back to his usual self, he suffered a leg break in a challenge with Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven and will have months on the sidelines.",
      "Isak remains a world-class striker capable of starring for any club in the world, but this unfortunate run of events have contributed to a chastening few months for Liverpool’s new British record signing, with his situation made more problematic by Hugo Ekitike’s performances.",
      "While Isak’s start to life at Liverpool has been ponderous at best, Ekitike immediately hit the ground running and has surely surpassed the expectations of even the most optimistic figures at the club.",
      "Especially considering Liverpool’s dire decline, 13 goal involvements in Ekitike’s first 25 competitive appearances is a fantastic effort. This is made even better by him also being a sublime technical footballer, resembling Thierry Henry in his pomp.",
      "So, as good as Isak clearly is, Liverpool would be just fine with Ekitike if push came to shove and the £130m that went on an unnecessary second new striker could be redistributed to land multiple new centre-backs and a successor for Mohamed Salah.",
      "",
      "The 2024/25 campaign was certainly a rare one to forget for Man City as their era of dominance ended with a whimper, though January signing Marmoush was a highlight of an otherwise poor campaign.",
      "Signed as part of Man City’s accelerated squad overhaul, Marmoush scored seven goals in his first 16 Premier League games and was Pep Guardiola’s best player during last season’s run-in.",
      "The 26-year-old was expected to kick on this season, but he has dramatically gone backwards and is still without a Premier League goal this term.",
      "Injuries have played their part, but also the freakish form of Erling Haaland has meant he has not had a sniff up front, while he has also been outperformed by other Man City wingers, particularly Jeremy Doku.",
      "And with Semenyo on the brink of joining Man City in January, Marmoush is already on the back foot and could even join rivals Spurs as they look to replace Johnson with a successor with a far greater output.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was another option for Man Utd as he has been unconvincing in the shadow of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, but Ugarte is their last fully fledged flop and needs to be sold as soon as possible by INEOS.",
      "Signed as a potential successor to Casemiro, Ugarte, who was also expected to benefit from a reunion with Ruben Amorim, has actually proven to be a huge dud for the Red Devils as an incredibly limited midfielder.",
      "Casemiro’s unexpected resurgence has further exposed Ugarte’s limitations in possession, with Man Utd looking far worse when the former Sporting Lisbon player is on the pitch instead of the veteran.",
      "Ugarte’s woes have forced Man Utd to get back to the drawing board for a new No.6 as they eye Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson, with their current star’s possible move to a Turkish giant to play a huge role in the club’s priority midfield overhaul next year.",

      "",
      "An initial loanee from Real Madrid in 2021, the current captain dethroned Theo Walcott as the Gunners’ king of January soon after the move was made permanent.",
      "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ran Walcott close as one of the few top-class winter signings Arsenal have ever made, but Odegaard’s influence on the most exciting side the Emirates has seen for too long makes him a worthy choice.",
      "The Norwegian was handed the armband in 2022 following Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette’s departures and Odegaard has flourished with the added responsibility.",
      "",
      "It feels likely that Rogers has triggered the necessary clauses to double the value of his initial £8m signing from Middlesbrough in January 2024. Which is a shame because a reported £80m price tag would make that a delightful sort of mark-up.",
      "Villa might nevertheless update those demands soon to better reflect the importance of a player with 10 goal involvements this season, as well as extensive Champions League and international experience.",
      "There is a simple lesson here: all the best footballers are somewhere in Boro.",
      "",
      "It was once Steve Cook but much like the Bournemouth record for Premier League appearances, Smith has opened up a commanding lead through sheer longevity.",
      "More than a decade has passed since Smith made the permanent move to Dean Court, having spent a season on loan with the Cherries in League One a few years before. And the captain is still going relatively strong, starting eight games this season to stretch his lead as Bournemouth’s record Premier League appearance maker to 61.",

      "",
      "Sean Dyche brought in Charlie Austin, Ashley Barnes, Kieran Trippier, Michael Keane, Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady in January transfer windows. But his most impressive purchase must surely be that of then-23-year-old Tarkowski, who transformed from Football League stalwart into fully-fledged England international at Turf Moor.",
      "Not many predicted he would be featuring for a World Cup semi-finalist while he was plodding around at Oldham and Brentford.",
      "",
      "In an alternate universe, the January arrivals of Kevin de Bruyne (2012) and Mohamed Salah (2014) might have heralded a dawn of complete Chelsea dominance.",
      "The Blues even once spent almost £300m in one winter window but Enzo Fernandez and Malo Gusto cannot quite compete with a club legend just yet.",
      "While Chelsea have historically struggled to add another attacking dimension to their squad mid-season, they have fared much better with defensive reinforcements. Gary Cahill was a fantastic addition in 2012, perhaps bettered only by that of Ivanovic four years before. The Serb spent nine years at Stamford Bridge, winning ten trophies in the process.",

      "But in terms of sheer value for money, Coleman pips his former team-mate. The Ireland international joined from Sligo Rovers for £60,000 as an unknown gamble and soon became one of the Premier League’s best right-backs. He is still going reasonably strong under his 427th Goodison Park manager at the ripe old age of 37.",

      "The Cottagers have done well out of the January market.",
      "Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey arrived in the mid-season window, as did Aleksandar Mitrovic, who pushed Hangeland hard for his crown. But the centre-back left a huge mark on Craven Cottage. He was one of Roy Hodgson’s first signings at Fulham in 2008 from FC Copenhagen and the defender became a stalwart through one of the greatest periods in the club’s history, with all of his seven seasons at Fulham spent in the Premier League.",
      "He made 270 appearances before he was released by Felix Magath, who Hangeland later claimed had instructed him to ease a thigh injury by placing a block of cheese on his leg. “I always try to see the good in people,” Hangeland said. “But Magath was an awful human being.”",

      "Garry Monk initially signed a player he had only briefly worked with at Swansea, but it was under Marcelo Bielsa that the true brilliance of Hernandez – completely out of place in England’s second tier – became apparent.",
      "A three-time consecutive Player of the Year for the Whites, Hernandez played as big a role as anyone in dragging Leeds back to the Premier League. The bit-part season he spent in the top flight offered flashes of his quality too.",

He assists, he plays, he behaves, he’s fair, doesn’t dive, doesn’t try to put opponents in the stands with an accumulation of cards,” the Portuguese added, doing one of his weird winks in the general direction of eventual winner Suarez.",
      "Dzeko arguably never earned the adulation he deserved at the Etihad, with a respectable 50 goals in 130 Premier League games, of which only 74 were starts. Only Sergio Aguero scored more goals (40) across the club’s first two title-winning seasons than the Bosnian (30).",

      "Chris Wood was the only bad buy among the five Eddie Howe made in winter 2022 – and his subsequent form at Nottingham Forest suggests it was just a case of incompatibility – but Guimaraes, signed from Lyon for a then-club-record £38m, was the best of the lot.",
      "Howe has numerous times described the Brazilian as “a bargain” and Guimaraes remains a player of expensive intrigue to the elite Newcastle cannot displace.",
      "",
      "Perhaps it’s recency bias and there might be an element of rule-bending in including a January loanee who scored just one goal before making his move permanent and netting a bucketload more.",

      "The 28-year-old has been sporadically linked with Man Utd in recent months and he has seven goals in his 18 Premier League appearances this term.",
      "The forward is only under contract until 2027, so Palace are running out of time to cash in on him if he does not sign a new deal and the report claims ‘talks have stalled’.",
      "This is said to have caught Man Utd’s attention as they have ‘turned to’ him ahead of January. The report claims: ‘Manchester United have turned their attention to a January move for Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, sources have told Football Insider.",

      "Another report from Football Insider says Neves would need to ‘sacrifice huge money’ to seal a move back to the Premier League, with football finance expert Stefan Borson explaining his situation.",
      "“I mean, on the face of it, it’s very expensive. But for the player to leave now and come to England would be sacrificing a huge amount of money from a tax perspective, I would think,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“It may well be that the player has decided that he doesn’t particularly care about the cash side of things, so he’s happy to fit in.",
      "“I think in any event, if he was on very big money, United simply wouldn’t do it under this new regime of trying to put some restraint into their wage bill. They have to do that. They’ve got no Champions League.”",
      "He added: “All the players have got let’s say a 20 per cent reduction on not being in the Champions League, and so by its very nature, their average wage bill right now could be £200,000.",
      "“If they’re getting the Champions League, the average maybe goes to £250k. Is Neves really going to fit in at £200k? I don’t know. It seems unlikely given that he’s probably been on closer to £500k a week in Saudi Arabia.",

      "Ruben Amorim has had a full season and now an entire calendar year as Manchester United boss. Whichever timeframe you view it from, and whatever context you apply, it’s been turgid.",
      "The manager will point to the league table as evidence that United enter 2026 in better shape than they stumbled into 2025, when Amorim was still getting his feet under the table at Old Trafford. A year later, this is his team, in his image. It was matched and, in some metrics, bettered than a team now mainly concerned with not being the Premier League’s worst ever.",
      "Being held by this Wolves side would inevitably prompt handwringing and teeth grinding on the Stretford End, but Tuesday’s 1-1 draw was not a result in isolation. It is the latest in a pattern of results and performances that Amorim owns to make it very difficult to be optimistic going into the new year.",
      "Everton: two wins in eight when they turned up. West Ham: two wins in 10. Bournemouth: two wins in 11. And Wolves: no wins in 18. All came to Old Trafford in the last six weeks and collectively left with double the number of points taken by the hosts.",
      "A bigger sample: Amorim has won just nine – losing the same number – of his 23 Premier League home games. Under him, United have a 39 per cent win ratio at Old Trafford.",
      "The manager knows that is not an acceptable record. That he doesn’t try to spin it any other way earns him more credit with many United fans than perhaps he is due. It resonates that Amorim is generally as exasperated as the fans over what his team have made them watch.",
      "But there is only so long that such honesty provides a pass before it washes no more. If that hasn’t expired after 12 months in charge, it certainly doesn’t stretch beyond a full calendar year.",
      "The deflating draw with Wolves underlined that United and Amorim appear to have had very different objectives for 2025.",
      "While the club were seeking simply to achieve a level of competency that would represent chronic underachievement in many previous years, Amorim appears to have been on a mission just to show United and the world how clever he is.",
      "Finally, after so long that many had given up hope of it ever happening, Amorim deviated from his precious 3-4-2-1 for the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day. Lo and behold, putting footballers in a shape more suited to their individual characteristics prompted one of the better performances of the year, at least for 45 minutes.",
      "Amorim deserves some credit for ducking out of a corner his dogmatic tactical approach had backed him in to. He insisted he would never deviate from his formation, even going so far as to warn the Pope not to bother trying to convince him to choose a path of enlightenment.",
      "So insistent was he that he was almost damned either way: for sticking with methods that were not succeeding; or for going back on his word.",
      "United fans were far more willing to forgive the second of those sins than the first. Four at the back sparked an improved performance with limited resources and an all-too-rare home win, despite yet more peculiar in-game changes that bordered on further self-sabotage.",
      "Next up: winless Wolves at home. And while weighing up whether to stick with what worked or return to his old ways, it is hard to shake the suspicion that Amorim looked at the visit of the league’s worst side as an opportunity to show his system can work if we would all just give it a 427th chance.",
      "In many ways, we have brought this on ourselves. It is not just United fans – but it’s especially United fans – who demanded a philosophy, a coach with a clear, discernible style. Everyone insists on recognisable patterns of play, as if predictability isn’t the easiest thing in football to defend against.",
      "Players want it too. Too many now cannot think for themselves having been prescripted every pass and run. Maybe it is easier to play that way, but it certainly a lot less fun for everyone involved.",
      "Well, you wanted a philosophy, you’ve got one. And, as a consequence, one of the many managers who views validation of their principles above all else.",
      "While that remains the case in 2026 and for as long as Amorim won’t change, nor will United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has turned another corner and ended up down a blind alley. Could he really be done for at Man United? And if so, who’s next?",
      "Chelsea parting ways with Enzo Maresca leaves Nuno Espirito Santo in a familiar position as the Sack Race favourite…",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has revealed his verdict on whether the Premier League giants will make “changes” in this month’s transfer window.",
      "The Mailbox is fed up with Chelsea’s ‘f***ing incompetent morons’, who ‘desperately need’ to appoint one of four alternatives to Liam Rosenior…",
      "Man Utd may never beat their worst January signing ever, but it’s Leeds who bought ‘the most expensive player in football history in terms of cost per game’.",
      "Man Utd should appoint Martin O’Neill with Ruben Amorim reaching the end of the line at Old Trafford in your first Mailbox of the new year."

      "Asked if the club are working on reinforcing the squad this window to help move up the table, Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation in this moment to have any change in the squad.",
      "\"There's the process. There's an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of Champions League, but we are also near eight teams behind us. So let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Prodded further as to whether players had come to him to ask to leave the club this window, Amorim added: \"No. None of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask for anything.\"",
      "\"It's an ambition [of mine] to be the best midfielder in the world. I just want to work hard, to take some advice, to take something from the midfielders. Not just in the Premier League, because I learned a lot from here,\" he said.",
      "\"Rodri and others, but I try to take [lessons from] outside of the Premier League. Like Ligue 1, Vitinha or Joao Neves.",
      "\"In LaLiga, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets. I try to learn every day. I'm watching them on YouTube.\"",
      "Baleba took his love for the game to France from Douala, Cameroon, with Lille beckoning. After rising through the ranks in France, a move to Brighton and the Premier League soon followed. He made the move to the Amex in August 2023 but it was his performances in the 2024/25 season that made everyone take note.",
      "Under the guidance of Fabian Hurzeler, Baleba emerged as one of the league's finest midfield prospects. But after a whirlwind summer, it's been a slower start to this campaign. The spotlight was always an ambition for Baleba but he didn't expect the speed at which his reputation would rise.",
      "\"When I see my name everywhere, I'm happy,\" he says. \"When I was a kid, it was a wish for my dad and my mum. It's a wish for me.",
      "\"I'm happy with it all. But it was overwhelming because I've done everything so fast. I've done things that some players at my age, they don't do the things like I did. But I'm really happy.\"",

      "Fourteen losses, 11 draws and 13 wins represent Manchester United's 2025 in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim. But nothing has been more reflective of their uncertain future under the Portuguese boss than his team selections, shape and approach.",
      "In November of 2024, a then-confident and vibrant Amorim, in his first interview with the club, explained the importance of establishing an identity.",
      "\"We know that we need time, but we have to win time,\" he told the club's official channels.",
      "\"To win time is to win games. But the most important thing for me is identity. So, since day one, we will start with our identity.\"",
      "On the heels of Amorim's first words as United boss was the now infamous 3-4-2-1 set-up. The three defenders, two pivot midfielders in between wing-backs behind a forward line of three, instantly came to define Amorim's United. In September 2025, Amorim said \"not even the Pope\" could change his approach to the game.",
      "Up until recently, his set-up had not changed, and fans and media alike questioned the former Sporting boss' ability to adapt after the approach bore very little fruit. It was an approach new to Old Trafford and its results did very little to inspire. A 15th-placed finish in the league and a Europa League final defeat were its offerings.",
      "While in game, naturally, roles would shift and change and, match to match, there were certain nuances that added difference, the three at the back was a fixture.",
      "In December, though, it was as if a switch had been flicked. As United managed a half-decent run of games, according to Amorim, it felt like the perfect opportunity to finally adapt.",
      "Somewhat forced to relent by Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo departing for the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim rejected any notion that outside pressure was to blame for his newfound tactical flexibility.",
      "On Boxing Day, in the win against Newcastle, Amorim started with four at the back for the first time since his appointment.",
      "\"When I came here last season, I understood that maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of the process,\" said Amorim ahead of Tuesday's draw with Wolves",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, so we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.\"",
      "But against Wolves, it was back to basics for the Portuguese. A tactical reversion called a \"backwards\" step by Gary Neville as Amorim returned to a back three. But why did he change back, are Man Utd ready to move beyond the back three and what changes has Amorim made to his approach throughout this season?",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Manchester United's Premier League curtain raiser was the first opportunity fans had to see some of the new signings in action. Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha started with Mason Mount also named too.",
      "Cunha played centrally, with Mount in the left attacking midfield role and Mbeumo to his right. United finished the game with more possession and twice Arsenal's number of shots.",
      "An early set-piece and Altay Bayindir mistake was the cause of United's defeat but there were immediate signs of a change in attacking approach. United's wing-backs and a willing runner in Mbeumo were impressive as Amorim's side used every occasion they could to send the ball over the top and stretch Arsenal's defence.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: After an underwhelming spell of games following the promise of the Arsenal performance, which included a harrowing loss at Brentford, an under-pressure Amorim travelled to the champions in the hope of securing back-to-back wins for the first time in his Premier League tenure.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was on the bench, despite starting the previous two and United returned to a forward line consisting of Cuhha, Mbeumo and Mount. United took the lead after just two minutes through Mbeumo. His run was rewarded as United caught Liverpool cold with an Amad pass in behind.",
      "United won through an emphatic Harry Maguire winner. But with less possession, United showed a rare staunch defence that managed to keep Liverpool out despite their mounting pressure. The win ensured a first victory for Man Utd at Anfield for almost a decade.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"Every time you play in this environment, if you [low] block well, especially in the beginning, you can feel the fans turning.",
      "\"We feel that in our stadium. All the big teams suffer from that. We tried to do that. I think we have to have more possession to help our players. They struggled in the end. But a good win, let's focus on the next one.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Amorim's first real stark deviation from his three at the back led to one of the more chaotic and entertaining Premier League clashes in recent history.",
      "The personnel said 3-4-2-1 but the positioning disagreed. Leny Yoro's role as a \"secret right-back\" as Gary Neville dubbed it saw him wider and higher than usual. In a 4-2-4 at times, United were able to flow forward freely.",
      "In the first half, United produced the second-highest non-penalty xG of 2.49, most shots (17), and joint-most touches in the opposition's box, with 30, of any side in the Premier League up to that point.",
      "United's attack came to the detriment of United's defensive performance, but it was a showing that gained real plaudits. Amorim showed a flexibility he had not in the past and it appeared to get the most out of his playing squad on the night.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"A fun game. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work on. We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work on, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: Full of confidence following on from the Bournemouth game, Amorim's tactical tweaks saw United impress again at Aston Villa. This fixture was the first without Amad and Mbeumo who had joined up with their respective nations for the AFCON.",
      "It was back to Amorim's tried and tested formation; however, United were full of energy, on the front foot and pressing high in another different take of Amorim's approach.",
      "Wing-backs Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot found great joy high and wide with Bruno Fernandes playing higher than usual too, in between Mount and Cunha, who had started in the 10s, behind Sesko.",
      "Fernandes' injury played a part, with Lisandro Martínez replacing him in midfield. That meant Manuel Ugarte stepped into the creative role.",
      "It was also one of United's more defensively secure performances of the six selected. United faced the second fewest shots on target among the selected games, winning possession the most and making the most recoveries. Unfortunately for Amorim, Morgan Rogers' sublime double, either side of Cunha's equaliser, was enough to beat United.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"I think we were the better team today. We were unlucky, even with the injury of Bruno, but during the game even without him, we were the better team. We did a very good job but no one is going to remember tomorrow because what matters is the result.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: A pragmatic Amorim had more tricks up his sleeve as United returned home to face Newcastle. So much so, Eddie Howe seemed to rely on goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale going down in order to gather some tactical thoughts.",
      "Dorgu playing on the right wing was a curious move from Amorim but given the fact he stroked home the winner, any questioning was made obsolete. In the first half, United impressed with Cunha and Dorgu causing Newcastle huge problems.",
      "But the second half was cause for concern. United held on but Newcastle finished the game matching United's 1.2 xG and having 16 shots at Old Trafford to the hosts' nine.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"In the first half, I think we showed that I felt that was the only way to create more danger - to have more opportunities was with the back four with a lot of guys inside.\"",
      "How did Amorim approach the game: As United fell back into a three at the back, so did their predictability. After finding joy with a back four, United's lack of inspiration with a back three was telling.",
      "Amorim made just one change with Joshua Zirkzee replacing the injured Mount but United looked well off the pace. Zirkzee off the right managed to score but that would be his only highlight before he was hooked at half-time.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced by Jack Fletcher and the formation looked closer to United's 4-2-3-1 from the Newcastle win but still Amorim's side struggled to find openings. Wolves, who remain winless in the league, saw their xG trump United's at 1 compared to 0.8 for the home side.",
      "United perhaps did not get the points to show for their performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle, taking just four points, but they competed. Against Wolves, it was a far cry from that, raising the question as to whether United are even ready to evolve from Amorim's approach.",
      "What Amorim said after the game: \"We struggled for the whole game. We had a lack of creativity but we knew that it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across Saturday's games and is tipping BOTH Wolves and Burnley to win...",
      "Nottingham Forest's attacking output is wobbling and confidence is a fragile thing for sides built on structure and discipline. Teams coached in the Sean Dyche mould can be notoriously streaky going forward and it can work both ways as when belief dips, chance creation tends to dry up. Forest arrive in that exact space, scoring just once in their last three and struggling to consistently provide quality in the final third.",
      "That's a problem at Villa Park. Aston Villa under Unai Emery are ruthless and have won their last 10 matches at their home fortress. They can win again, without conceding, which is a 2/1 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Burnley's 10-game winless run jumps off the page and most will declare this a home banker at 1/2 with Sky Bet - but dig a little deeper and there are signs of life. Scott Parker has been proactive rather than stubborn, tweaking personnel and roles to try and spark something.",
      "He's found an exciting dynamic in his attack in the Marcus Edwards-Armando Broja pairing, who looked genuinely dangerous against Newcastle. Edwards' ability to receive between the lines and commit defenders gave Burnley a threat they've lacked for weeks, while Broja's power and direct can stretch a backline.",
      "Brighton look vulnerable again priced up as the odds-on favourites. They're six without a win themselves and games at the Amex have recently lacked the control and fluency that once made them so reliable. If Burnley play with the same attacking edge they showed last time out, this could quickly turn into an uncomfortable afternoon for the hosts.",
      "This has all the hallmarks of where a extraordinary run finally snaps.",
      "Wolves reaching the 20th game of the season without a win is the kind of unique run that rarely drags on forever. Football has a habit of correcting these extremes, especially when performances are starting to hint at a shift beneath the surface. And Wolves' recent displays suggest this isn't a team completely lost.",
      "The performances against Liverpool and Manchester United were quietly encouraging. Wolves competed, pressed with purpose and crucially, showed a level of bravery in possession that has been missing at times this season.",
      "West Ham are criminally soft when coming under pressure in games and Wolves may just need one moment to take advantage in what is likely to be an ugly affair. The home side to win by one goal looks a bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "It's currently impossible to build a credible case for Bournemouth against anyone in the Premier League, let alone the league leaders. Their defensive numbers have nosedived to worrying levels and the eye test matches the data. They look open, fragile and far too easy to play through. Conceding 2.25 goals per 90 across their last 12 matches is alarming on its own, but the expected goals against figure of 1.9 per 90 suggests this isn't bad luck, it's an underlying issue that has shown no signs of being fixed.",
      "Arsenal don't need many invitations to punish mistakes and Bournemouth are currently handing them out far too frequently.",
      "It's back to our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals that has landed in five of their last seven games.",

      "But when you draw at home to a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches in all competitions, there will be scrutiny. Particularly when Ruben Amorim switched back to his favoured back three to 'match up' with a side still winless in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim talked of the difficulty in relying on inexperienced players afterwards but he introduced one - Jack Fletcher - when removing Joshua Zirkzee, United's goalscorer, at the interval. \"It was tactical,\" he confirmed. They could not deal with Wolves' midfield, he argued.",
      "If that change was strange, the like-for-like substitution of Ayden Heaven - perhaps United's best outfield player again - for Leny Yoro was also difficult for supporters to understand. They booed that late switch, having booed the team off at half-time and full-time.",
      "Amorim remains confident, he insists, that United will be far stronger when his stars are back but the frustration is that the opportunity is being missed in the here and now. His team could have gone fourth with a better display against the bottom club.",
      "Five of the last seven games in which they have scored first have not been won. Home games against 10-man Everton, a woeful West Ham, a Bournemouth side they were beating three times and now this Wolves team, adrift in the table, have not been won.",
      "And the worry is that Amorim is a big part of the reason for that. The man in whom everyone is supposed to trust sometimes feels like a stumbling block to success rather than the architect of it. Leeds and Burnley await. Those games come with real risk now.Adam Bate",
      "Martin Odegaard's role in Arsenal's second goal against Aston Villa typified all he brings Mikel Arteta's side at his best. First, the off-the-ball alertness to pounce on Youri Tielemans' loose pass. Then a through-ball so perfectly measured that Martin Zubimendi didn't even need to break his stride.",

      "\"I think he was very, very good today.\"",

      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",

      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",

      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",

      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",
      "The teenager scored on his Leipzig debut in the cup before netting in three consecutive appearances in October and bagging a hat-trick against Freiburg just before travelling out to Morocco to represent Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "The prospect of losing Diomande so quickly would not have been part of the plan when they paid €20m to sign him in the summer but Leipzig are pragmatic about their business model, honing young talent and selling them on for a significant profit.",
      "\"Yan is an outstanding talent, a high-potential profile and we exactly looked for this profile. Yes, it was a certain amount we spent but there were so many clubs in competition to sign him. So we are really happy, really proud to sign a young jewel.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim claims journalists and pundits calling for him to change his team's formation left him with little choice but to stick with it, fearing he would lose the dressing room if the players thought he was reacting to criticism from outside",
      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",
