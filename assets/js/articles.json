      "Manchester United's Premier League campaign is just over a week away, but their transfer business could continue beyond then. Ruben Amorim's squad has been bolstered with the addition of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon, with all signs suggesting there's more to come.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is next in line, though - at the time of writing - a deal for the striker has been agreed but not completed, with a medical now set to be completed. United have also explored a move for Carlos Baleba, but it could be tricky to find the funds to sign the Cameroonian midfielder on top of a £70m+ deal for Sesko.",
      "United take on Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly on Saturday, looking to round off an unbeaten run of matches in Europe and the United States. The stand-out result was a 4-1 victory over Bournemouth, while Amorim's team also beat West Ham and drew with both Everton and Leeds.",
      "They will begin their Premier League campaign the following weekend with a blockbuster game against Arsenal. The Gunners suffered a second pre-season defeat on Wednesday, following up a 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Hong Kong with a home reverse against Villarreal.",
      "Christian Eriksen could be about to make an immediate return to the Premier League with Burnley. The Danish midfielder has been a free agent since leaving Old Trafford at the end of June, and opted against dropping down to the Championship with Wrexham.",
      "According to The Mail, Scott Parker's newly promoted Clarets have made contact over a potential move, though they face competition from elsewhere in Europe. If they succeed, they would reunite Eriksen with his former Tottenham team-mate Kyle Walker after landing the right-back earlier in the window.",
      "Burnley also confirmed the signing of former United loanee Martin Dubravka on Thursday. The Slovakian goalkeeper, who joins from Newcastle, played two cup games while on loan at Old Trafford during the 2022-23 season.",
      "Carlos Baleba is a player who United clearly rate highly, and their former captain Roy Keane agrees. Keane made a glowing assessment of the Brighton midfielder last season, before United's recent interest came to light.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said during Brighton's FA Cup run last term. \"Fantastic. Great example. The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "United are unlikely to be able to bring in Baleba this summer without raising significant funds, though the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund could yet move on. It may end up being a case of letting the midfielder spend another year on the south coast before swooping in 2026.",
      "If and when Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, he will be entering an environment which has a new set of rules in place. Ruben Amorim imposed a number of changes since arriving in November as the permanent successor to former boss Erik ten Hag, and he was the one who put those new rules in place.",
      "Some of the rules are specific to players, including banning them from going on holiday during international breaks. This is unlikely to be a big factor for Sesko, who is one of the first names on Slovenia's team-sheet, but others have been impacted.",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, while ordering players to pick up equipment if they lose the mini-matches played during training sessions. The final rule concerns coaches - getting them to simplify advice - but this too will affect the playing staff.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Brighton are demanding €120million (£104m) for Carlos Baleba, with Manchester United eyeing a move for the midfielder. The Red Devils have made contact with Brighton over Baleba, but are aware a deal may be unrealistic this summer.",
      "United have spent more than £130m so far this summer to bring in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon, while Benjamin Sesko is set to complete a £74m move to Old Trafford after flying into the UK for a medical.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim is hoping to continue strengthening his squad and the United boss is a big fan of Baleba. According to ESPN, Brighton have set an asking price of £104m for the 21-year-old.",
      "The report states that both United and Manchester City are interested in Baleba and claim that the Red Devils' move for Sesko will make it 'more difficult' for them to sign the Cameroon international.",
      "Baleba is also said to be happy to remain at Brighton for another season, with a big move more likely to occur next summer. If Baleba does leave Brighton, he will become the latest player to earn a big-money move after impressing for the Seagulls.",
      "Moises Caicedo, Marc Cucurella and Joao Pedro have all been signed by Chelsea in recent seasons, while Arsenal have previously raided Brighton for Ben White and Leandro Trossard.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister has become a Premier League winner after leaving Brighton for Liverpool, while Tottenham spent around £30m to sign Yves Bissouma. Baleba has impressed in his three seasons at Brighton, having been signed from Lille in 2023 as a replacement for Caicedo.",
      "When asked about Baleba's future, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told BBC Sussex: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me.",
      "\"So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens.",
      "\"We don't want to sell our best players. Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has 'liked' a post confirming Manchester United's agreement to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian has been at the centre of a rollercoaster transfer saga, but he is now set to sign for the Red Devils after snubbing Newcastle's more lucrative offer.",
      "Ruben Amorim is now nearing his third significant summer signing, with Sesko now in Manchester to complete his medical and sign his contract. The Athletic reports that a deal worth €75.6million (£65.5m), plus €8.5m (£7.4m) in add-ons, has been agreed to strengthen United's attacking line-up.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo became the second summer recruit following his long-awaited switch from Brentford, while the deal to bring Matheus Cunha to the Theatre of Dreams was more straightforward as his release clause was activated.",
      "The pursuit of Sesko has been widely reported, with the saga reaching its crescendo this week. Newcastle were first to have a bid accepted for the 22-year-old, before the Red Devils launched their own offer.",
      "The Bundesliga club ultimately gave the green light to both, leaving Sesko to make the final decision - opting for Manchester over Newcastle",
      "And the social media account of United striker Hojlund was among those, despite the fact that Sesko's arrival could mean increased competition for a starting spot.",
      "The MEN reported on Wednesday that the former Atalanta striker seems resigned to being pushed out by Manchester United once Sesko finalises his move.",
      "Sources close to the Dane have hinted that while being sidelined might boost Hojlund's performance, he may ultimately need to consider a transfer before the September deadline if he remains out of favour.",
      "His limited playing time could also jeopardise his spot in Denmark's national squad. His nation are on track to qualify for next year's expanded World Cup, but Hojlund lost his place in the team in June following a spell of just one goal in 15 appearances for his country.",
      "During the recent pre-season tour in America, Hojlund shared his determination to secure his position in Amorim's team. \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens,\" he declared.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has touched down in the United Kingdom ahead of his £74million transfer to Manchester United. The RB Leipzig striker only saw his move to Old Trafford get the green light on Thursday afternoon, but has wasted no time travelling across Europe.",
      "Sesko will sign a five year contract with the Red Devils, having sensationally snubbed a more lucrative offer from Premier League rivals Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side opened the bidding war earlier this week, seeing a second offer worth £71m up front accepted.",
      "However, the feeling was that the Slovenian was waiting on an offer from Manchester, which was launched on Wednesday. That deal will see Leipzig rake in £66.4m up front, add-ons of £7.6m and a friendly against the 20-time champions of England.",
      "The Bundesliga side ultimately accepted that proposal, leaving the player to pick his preferred destination. That proved to be with Ruben Amorim, despite reports that Newcastle had offered him a bigger salary.",
      "Sesko left Leipzig, in Eastern Germany at around 5.30pm on Thursday afternoon, with more than 10,000 eager supporters tracking its progress.",
      "With the player touched down in Manchester, it is now expected that he will complete his medical and sign his contract on Friday. He will then be officially presented to fans on Saturday, when his new team-mates face Fiorentina in their final pre-season match.",
      "He will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively, in a new look Manchester United attack worth more than £200m. Amorim made attacking reinforcements his number one priority this summer after a dismal season which saw them finish 15th and score just 44 league goals in the process.",
      "Amorim's attention can now turn towards a new midfield player, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba at the top of their wishlist. The 21-year-old is the latest Seagulls star tipped for massive things, following the sales of players like Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Joao Pedro.",
      "Baleba has three years remaining on his deal at The Amex, with Brighton unwilling to sell at this point. Nevertheless, contact has been made via intermediaries with the Red Devils boss desperate to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park.",
      "Sesko’s arrival could signal Rasmus Hojlund’s exit from the club just two years after his own blockbuster transfer. Hojlund, 22, arrived to much fanfare in the summer of 2023, signing from Atalanta in a deal worth an initial £64m.",
      "However, he has struggled since arriving in the Premier League and now looks destined to be on the move before the end of the window. United are said to be willing to take a big hit on the forward, who is available for around £40m.",
      "Marcus Rashford has already departed during the window after falling out of favour under Amorim. Alejandro Garnacho is also poised to exit, with Chelsea advancing in talks to sign the Argentine.",
      "Antony, signed for £85m in 2022, is another high-profile summer signing with no future under the Red Devils boss. He spent the second half of last season in Spain with Real Betis, but is yet to secure a permanent exit.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been given a full pre-season with his Manchester United squad for the first time, and he'll hope it does the business. The Portuguese has the team playing in his preferred three-at-the-back system, and has already added the likes of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the roster.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is next in line, with the Slovenian opting for United over rivals Newcastle. Profit and Sustainability regulations may limit what else can be done, but some high-profile exits could yet free up funds.",
      "Marcus Rashford's wages are off the books after his loan move to Barcelona, while Jadon Sancho is expected to join Juventus once the Turin club can shift some players themselves. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund are among the others potentially available for the right price, though Harry Maguire is staying put.",
      "Aside from the new-look front-line, United have looked into midfield reinforcements in the form of Carlos Baleba. The Brighton star could set them back a cool £100million, though, and that may be a tall order this summer.",
      "Despite their lowly finish last term, United actually conceded fewer goals than top-half finishers Brentford and Brighton and only three more than sixth-place Aston Villa. It may be for this reason that Amorim has decided against major surgery at the back.",
      "Andre Onana remains United's first-choice keeper for now despite some high-profile errors last term. He should be helped by the return of Lisandro Martinez after a long-term injury, with the Argentine sorely missed towards the tail end of last season, though it remains to be seen how soon he'll be Premier League ready.",
      "Martinez will be first choice on the left of the back three, with Leny Yoro on the right and Matthijs de Ligt between them. Harry Maguire will also be an option in the middle, with the former captain expected to extend his contract, while the versatile Noussair Mazraoui can expect to get minutes at centre-back or wing-back depending on the opposition.",
      "We're including those wing-back roles as part of the midfield here, for simplicity's sake. Here, the likes of Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot remain options, but United's best XI may well be one with the more attack-minded Amad and Patrick Dorgu out wide.",
      "In the middle, signings further up the field are expected to push captain Bruno Fernandes into a deeper role for the most part. Baleba would be his natural partner if a deal can be done, providing a ball-winning option alongside the Portugal star.",
      "If Baleba stays at Brighton, though, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro will battle it out for that other spot. Toby Collyer and Kobbie Mainoo will also have a role to play, though there were times last term when Amorim appeared keen to play Mainoo further forward.",
      "United scored just 44 league goals last season. Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko scored 48 between them, which our rudimentary maths leads us to believe is more than 44.",
      "The addition of £74m man Sesko could well help ease the pressure on £72m Hojlund, too. However, without European football to share the workload around, there may be questions over the minutes afforded to the Dane.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee will provide a solid rotation option, and showed last season that he could be handy when not being asked to put up the kind of goal numbers he has never put up in his career. There will also be times when Fernandes plays behind the striker to accommodate an extra defensive midfielder - perhaps even for the opening game against Arsenal if Amorim doesn't want to throw all three new boys in at once.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The 21-year-old is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', having been frozen out alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Rashford has since joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy, but the other four players are still in situ. However, Garnacho could be set to get his move away, with Chelsea ready to offer him a fresh start.",
      "According to the Athletic, talks over a deal for Garnacho have 'advanced' and the player is said to have 'ruled out all options this summer' other than joining Chelsea or remaining at United.",
      "Chelsea have had a longstanding interest in Garnacho and it is claimed that he expects the move to happen. Garnacho and Amorim fell out after the winger was benched for United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Immediately after the final, Garnacho was critical of Amorim and told reporters: \"It's hard for everyone. The season was s***, both now losing the final tonight, and in the league, where we didn't beat anyone, that's the truth.",
      "\"Up until the final, I've played every round, and today to play 20 minutes… I don't know. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens after.\"",
      "And when asked about Garnacho's future earlier this month, Amorim said: \"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy. But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that.",

      "Benjamin Sesko turned down a bigger money offer from Newcastle, such was his desire to instead sign for Manchester United. The RB Leipzig striker is to sign a five-year contract at Old Trafford with the dramatic transfer saga reaching its conclusion.",
      "Sesko will complete Ruben Amorim’s attacking overhaul, joining in a deal that could eventually reach £74million. The Bundesliga club have accepted a bid worth £66.4m up front and a further £7.6m in add-ons to sign.",
      "The Slovenian will arrive in Manchester for a medical after deciding against signing for their Premier League rivals Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side opened the bidding war earlier this week, offering £71m up front and more in incentives.",
      "And with Leipzig accepting both offers, it came down to the 22-year-old to make the final decision on his destination. But despite Newcastle boasting Champions League football, the Red Devils have won the race.",
      "After missing out on Europe altogether following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, there was apprehension they would be unable to land some of their top targets. Instead, Sesko was so enamoured with making the move to Manchester, he is leaving money on the table.",
      "He will join Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively, in a new look Manchester United attack worth more than £200m. Amorim made attacking reinforcements his number one priority this summer after a dismal season which saw them finish 15th and score just 44 league goals in the process.",
      "Amorim's attention can now turn towards a new midfield player, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba at the top of their wishlist. The 21-year-old is the latest Seagulls star tipped for massive things, following the sales of players like Moises Caicedo, Alexis Mac Allister and Joao Pedro.",
      "Baleba has three years remaining on his deal at The Amex, with Brighton unwilling to sell at this point. Nevertheless, contact has been made via intermediaries with the Red Devils boss desperate to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle have been left licking their wounds again after yet another near miss in the summer window. Howe had hoped for a transformative window on Tyneside after returning to Europe's elite with a top-four finish.",
      "However, they have now missed out on a host of their top targets, with the future of star striker Alexander Isak remaining up in the air. The Magpies had initially targeted France international Hugo Ekitike, with the idea of pairing him up front with Isak.",
      "Instead, Ekitike made the move to Liverpool, with Anfield bosses now hoping to double down and snatch Isak from St James' Park as well. The Sweden international missed the club's tour of Asia and has been asked to train away from team-mates since their return.",

      "Sesko had been heavily linked with Arsenal earlier in the summer and the Gunners, like United, are long-term admirers of the striker.",
      "However, talk of a move to the Premier League was put on ice when Arsenal instead chose to pursue a move for Viktor Gyokeres, who joined the Londoners from Sporting Lisbon, having grown frustrated with demands from both RBL and the Sesko camp.",
      "Newcastle made a big play to sign the striker and actually made a bigger offer to the German club, but it quickly emerged that Sesko's preference was a move to Manchester United. United have also agreed to play RBL in a pre-season friendly next summer.",
      "Sesko's arrival should be confirmed in good time ahead of the new season, which starts next week. United face Arsenal at Old Trafford in their season opener on Sunday 17 August."

      "Roy Keane's glowing assessment of Carlos Baleba might just be vindicated this summer as Manchester United ramp up their interest in the Brighton enforcer. The former Ireland captain was one of many who heaped praise on Baleba last season, and it seems United have sat up and taken note.",
      "They've made enquiries to Brighton about the 21-year-old's availability, according to The Athletic. After Moises Caicedo's big-money move to Chelsea in 2023, Baleba filled the void at the Amex and has quietly impressed in the role. Though not often in the spotlight, the Cameroon star has become an essential part of Brighton's engine room.",
      "Despite his low profile, Baleba's ability hasn't gone unnoticed - with United legend Keane waxing lyrical about him back in March. The 53-year-old not only commended Baleba's displays but also applauded Brighton's consistently sharp recruitment, with the club seemingly set to reap the rewards of their investment in the midfielder.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said on ITV following Baleba's standout performance in Brighton's FA Cup victory over Newcastle. \"Fantastic. Great example,\" he added. \"The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "Although discussions are underway, United understand that signing Baleba from Brighton will be difficult. He still has three years left on his current contract, and the south coast club have gained a reputation for driving hard bargains - having secured big-money sales for players like Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "To complicate matters further, United are still prioritising a move for Benjamin Sesko - a transfer that could consume much of their remaining budget. With approximately £130million already committed to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, landing Sesko could take their total spending close to or beyond the £200m mark.",
      "With no income yet from player sales and PSR concerns still looming, the Red Devils can ill afford to spend recklessly this summer. That said, signing a defensive midfielder is reportedly high on their agenda, and Baleba is among the leading candidates.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, hold the advantage in negotiations. Not only is Baleba secured on a long-term contract, but the club has already brought in over £100m in sales this summer, cashing in on players like Pedro, Simon Adringa and Pervis Estupinan.",
      "Baleba, who has previously attracted attention from Liverpool, has also indicated he's content at Brighton for now. \"If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future,\" he said in May.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "Having arrived from Lille for a fee of around £24m, Baleba's price tag has reportedly skyrocketed, with suggestions Brighton could demand close to £100m for the promising midfielder.",
      "The Seagulls' reputation for uncovering undervalued talent, developing them, and selling at a premium has set a benchmark in football recruitment in recent years. Even as their spending power grows, they continue to generate impressive profits through strategic player sales.",
      "This summer may see a showdown between Brighton's calculated transfer planning and United's drive to land elite talent. Whether Keane's prediction proves accurate remains to be seen - but if negotiations advance, this could become one of the window's most compelling transfer sagas.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand feels Harry Maguire has practically 'risen from the dead' under Ruben Amorim. The seasoned centre-half joined Manchester United back in 2019, but his Old Trafford tenure has been far from plain sailing.",
      "Maguire played a big part in the club's eighth-place finish under Erik ten Hag in the 2023/24 campaign. As a result, the 32-year-old received a wealth of criticism for his performances on the pitch by fans, pundits and club legends alike. Maguire was phased out under Ten Hag as United kicked off last season, deemed surplus to requirements by the Dutchman.",
      "But when Amorim arrived as his successor in November, the Sheffield-born player was able to fight his way back into the team and show some incredible individual performances – despite United ultimately finishing in 15th in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, Maguire now appears to be a part of Amorim's plans for the new season. While he is out of contract next summer, and with a wealth of interest coming from three Premier League clubs – as well as two teams in Italy – it seems increasingly likely that Maguire will stay put. All five transfer approaches were knocked back by United, as per The Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire is said to be keen on signing another extension, which would see him retire at Old Trafford. While the club are said to be on the same page, no formal talks have begun as of yet.",
      "Speaking about Maguire's career resurgence on his Rio Presents podcast alongside Joel Beya, Ferdinand was quick to praise the character and resilience he had shown in hard times.",
      "The former Manchester United and England star said: \"I ain't got that bad energy energy for players or for the club, I want them to do well. But if they don't play well, I'm gonna say what I see, and I had that discussion with Harry Maguire.\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"We had the tough questions like that, what's it like you having criticism? And someone who risen from the dead almost, shown character. He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",
      "Maguire's decision to remain at Old Trafford last summer despite Ten Hag's decision has seemingly paid dividends, with Amorim since finding a role in the squad for the former club captain and rewarding him with a one-year contract extension in January.",
      "On top of that, Amorim has also included Maguire in a six-man leadership group alongside Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, as he looks to utilise the passing down of experience of senior players to younger members of the squad.",
      "Speaking about the cohort, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "Maguire has also excelled during United's pre-season tour of America, starting in the side's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "It will be interesting to see if he starts when United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford come Saturday. Their Premier League opener follows on Sunday, August 17 against Arsenal, where Maguire could face former Red Devils target Viktor Gyokeres, who Amorim knows all about from their time together at Sporting CP.",

      "Paul Pogba has launched a luxury jewellery business with wife Zulay as he looks to get his life back on track following his doping scandal. The French midfielder recently signed a two-year deal with AS Monaco, restarting his footballing journey after receiving a ban for failing a drug test.",
      "Now, Pogba is eager to put his recent troubles behind him as he launches 'Unbreakable', a luxury collection in collaboration with his wife and jewellery house Elke Berr. Speaking to Var-Matin, Zulay described the struggles her husband has been through as something that created an extremely strong bond between them.",
      "She said: \"Paul’s problems were public. It affected us as a couple. It affected our children. We have been through very tough times, but we have stayed united. This is what we wanted to communicate through the collection: you are not alone in facing difficulties, what matters is getting back up.\"",
      "Pogba was once revered as one of the brightest talents in Europe. He found success at Juventus before returning to Manchester United, winning multiple trophies at the highest level. However, in 2023, the midfielder was initially suspended from playing after failing a drug test, with DHEA found in his system while in his second stint in Turin.",
      "More failed results followed, and the Italian side mutually agreed to terminate his contract after Pogba was banned from playing for four years by the Italian Anti-Doping National Tribunal. This ban was later reduced to 18 months, and he was allowed back into the competitive foray by March of this year.",
      "It wasn't just the stress of Pogba's drug ban that brought the couple closer together, though. The French international saw his brother, Mathias, sentenced to three years in prison in 2024 - with two years suspended - for attempted extortion of the ex-United star.",
      "The former footballer had been accused, alongside five other men, of attempting to extort €13million (£10.7m) from Pogba, and was found guilty last year - despite protesting his innocence throughout.",
      "Now, the current Monaco midfielder is trying to put his past behind him and focus on the future with his wife and children, with the jewellery business a joint venture between the two. Discussing their struggles, Zulay said: \"Unbreakable isn’t just about Paul and me.",
      "\"It’s a shared story – that of a child with their mother or father, sisters, brothers, two best friends. These bonds help us not to be defeated by life’s roller coaster. For us, Unbreakable is more than just a jewellery collection. It’s a symbol.\"",
      "The collection offers many different styles of jewellery, from necklaces to rings and bracelets, and is available on the Elke Berr Joaillerie website. Pogba and his partner plan to open a showroom in Monaco next September in collaboration with Monte-Carlo Diamonds.",
      "The Bolivian model added: \"What we went through was seen by many because it was public. But getting back up isn’t just about returning to sport, it’s about returning to life.\"",
      "As Ligue 1 returns in a week, Pogba will hope his life will remain positive. For now, fans will assume a spot in France's 2026 World Cup squad is a potential pipe dream - but the 32-year-old will be back on the pitch soon enough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba highlighted his elite mentality when dismissing transfer rumours last year. The Brighton star has attracted interest from a number of top clubs, but rather than getting caught up in all the noise, Baleba has insisted he just wants to get his head down and work hard.",
      "United have splurged well over £100million on attacking talent this summer and are nearing a deal for another forward - Benjamin Sesko - for a fee of around £74m.",
      "But they are yet to secure a central midfielder, arguably one of the areas they most need to bolster, especially considering Ruben Amorim's doubts about Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte, as well as the fact that Casemiro is not getting any younger.",
      "That could soon change, though, as reports emerged on Wednesday evening claiming United intermediaries had reached out to Brighton to discuss a potential deal for 21-year-old Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba matches the profile of the midfielder Ineos have been targeting for United, considering his age, skillset, and top-flight experience. Rio Ferdinand told United chiefs to prioritise a move for him over Sesko last month, labelling him as a midfielder who can 'do it all'.",
      "The 21-year-old has also shown valuable traits, including a strong work ethic and humility during his short time at Brighton. He demonstrated his character last year when quizzed about being linked with a transfer amid rumoured interest from clubs like Liverpool.",
      "When asked about talk of a potential move to other Premier League sides, Baleba emphasised he was not focused on other clubs. Instead, he stated he was eager to keep progressing and even hinted he may not be ready to be a star player at a top club.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don’t know if I’m going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn’t do it for me.",
      "\"It’s not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "The Red Devils appeared to receive a boost in their plans to sign Baleba when journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that agreeing personal terms is unlikely to be a stumbling block with the player, who still has three years remaining on his current contract at the AMEX Stadium.",
      "However, Brighton chief Paul Barber has since denied claims of United making an approach for the player, labelling the transfer links as mere \"speculation\". The Athletic also reported that Brighton have no plans to sanction a sale this summer and wish to retain Baleba for another year.",
      "That could be a significant setback to Ruben Amorim's hopes of signing him, given Brighton's reputation for being tough negotiators. At this point, it also seems unlikely that United will be in the financial position to offer the sort of money that would be required to tempt Brighton into parting with their star player.",
      "The Cameroon international joined Brighton in 2023 following the departures of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo. Since his arrival, he has developed into one of the Premier League's most impressive central midfielders, featuring in 77 matches for the Seagulls across all competitions.",

      "But as Nunez prepares to undergo a medical before completing his £46million move, Saunders has questioned why Liverpool's domestic rivals decided against pursuing a move for the striker.",
      "\"Nunez, he’s up for grabs. Would you rather not have Nunez than Sesko and Gyokeres?’ Saunders said on talkSPORT. \"They paid a lot of money for them, and I thought, ‘He’s up for grabs.’ I would take a chance on him.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He’s got every finish in his locker, both feet, headers, he’s gone round the keeper, he’s slotted the keeper, he’s chipped the keeper, he’s scored from distance.",
      "\"We’ve seen him do every finish, but somehow he manages to conjure up a miss – I don’t know how many times he hit the post and the crossbar last season.",
      "\"There’s definitely a player in there, you look at him and think, ‘What a handful he is to play against.’",
      "\"He scored a lot of goals for Benfica in his second season and a couple of seasons ago he got 20-odd for Liverpool. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nunez goes somewhere else and scores 20 goals next season.\"",
      "With Nunez now off the books at Anfield, Liverpool are expected to sign a replacement before the transfer window shuts next month. Isak remains their primary target, however, Newcastle do not want to sell their star striker and it's thought Liverpool would need to pay at least £150m to bring the Sweden star to Merseyside.",

      "Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, may have some big boots to fill in football after his dad burst onto the scene at Everton and barely looked back, but he's enjoying his own rapid rise at Manchester United. The youngster is one of the stars of the club's academy and is enjoying an impressive time as part of the setup.",
      "The 15-year-old is stepping up to the Red Devils' Under-19 side after earning a surprise call-up for the Mladen Ramljak Tournament in Croatia, per reports. Rooney will face players four years his senior at the competition hosted by Dinamo Zagreb.",
      "The forward jumps three age groups after impressing for United already in a pre-season tournament, Northern Ireland's Super Cup NI. The youngster produced a goal and assist as his team reached the final to lose to Southampton.",
      "And now he has the opportunity to light up a tournament that has seen the likes of Luka Modric and Eduardo Camavinga shine in the past. Some way to spend the school holidays.",
      "United will be joined by Rapid Bucuresti, Juventus and Dinamo Zagreb in Group A in Croatia and get underway against the former. The winner of that group will take on the victor of Group B, which will see Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Bologna and Shakhtar Donetsk contend for a place in the final.",
      "The son of United's top goalscorer ever is not alone in being fast-tracked into the U19 squad either. Rooney will be joined by some of his contemporaries in the U15 and U16s, including JJ Gabriel who has been dubbed Kid Messi and the Red Devils battled to keep at the club.",
      "Rooney Sr watched from the stands when Kai competed in the tournament in Northern Ireland. The former Derby and Birmingham boss saw young Southampton ace Jude Daniels troll him by using his own celebration when scoring against United.",
      "Daniels tapped home from close range before facing the crowd and replicating Rooney's iconic punching celebration to rub salt into the wound. The youngster then fell slowly backwards for his team-mates to catch him.",
      "Rooney Jr has seen some success this year however and scored the match-winning goal when the Red Devils won the U15 Premier League Floodlit Cup North title. The academy star capped off a remarkable turnaround for his side in extra time after the team came back from three goals down with just 12 minutes left on the clock, against local rivals Manchester City.",
      "The youngster has had to contend with having a famous father too during his time coming through the youth ranks. \"A few years ago, I remember my son Kai took a penalty at St George’s Park, where we were for a tournament,\" Coleen told the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It went to penalties, Kai stepped up and just skied it. Afterwards I asked him how he could take a penalty like that, and he told me he was just fuming as the goalkeeper was saying ‘Your dad’s s***’, and he got dead angry.",
      "\"It doesn’t happen to him very often, but it did then, and you can see in some games where they give you a little push. He’s strong-minded though and usually shrugs it off.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Danny Welbeck has previously tipped Manchester United transfer target Carlos Baleba to become one of the best midfielders in the world. United head coach Ruben Amorim has mainly focussed on bolstering his attack this summer, but is turning attention to the middle of the park.",
      "The Red Devils began the transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, before going on to splash £71million on Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, while 18-year-old defensive prospect Diego Leon also arrived in-between those arrivals.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also closing in on a mega-money move to Old Trafford, and it seems that once that deal is done, United could turn to Baleba, having now been linked with a swoop for the Cameroon international.",
      "The Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder, who has previously been admired by Chelsea, has caught United's eye with his impressive performances for Fabian Hurzeler's side. He has also more than impressed team-mate and former United forward Welbeck, who believes Baleba has the potential to become one of the best in world football.",
      "In an interview with BBC Radio Sussex back in November last year, Welbeck explained his thoughts on the 21-year-old. The ex-Arsenal forward said: \"He can be unstoppable. If he keeps up with that desire and passion, he can go right to the top. He’s got all of the attributes to be a world-beater.”",
      "Welbeck is not the only former United star who has been impressed by Baleba. Rio Ferdinand recently admitted he would like to see his former side try and sign the promising box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the former England and United skipper said: \"I’m being greedy, and [if] we are able to shift the other players that are surplus to requirements, I’d be going for Baleba in midfield.",
      "\"[He] beats the press on a regular basis. [He’s] confident on the ball. [He] can move, is mobile. He is a Ruben Amorim midfielder.”",
      "According to The Athletic, United have already made contact with Brighton about a potential move for Baleba. However, it's also claimed the Red Devils would need to sell some unwanted players such as Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, before they can make a meaningful bid for Baleba.",
      "The midfielder has three years left on his deal, which gives the Seagulls plenty of room to demand a high fee. Two seasons ago, Brighton extracted £115m from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo, a Premier League record transfer at the time.",
      "It's understood Brighton may demand a similar transfer fee for Baleba, although United are thought to value him at around £70m.",
      "When asked about the Red Devils' interest in Baleba, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told spectators at a supporters event: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [head coach Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Baleba, 21, is entering his third season with the Seagulls, having joined them from French side Lille in 2023 for £23.2million. Two years later and the Cameroonian is valued at around triple that amount.",
      "Considered one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League, Baleba's stock has been steadily rising over the course of that time. Reports emerged on Wednesday claiming that United had been in touch to explore the conditions of a move.",
      "Financing the deal would be one part of the equation while convincing Baleba would be another. Fortunately for the Red Devils, they can turn to Leny Yoro.",
      "Defender Yoro played played alongside the 21-year-old for Lille and the pair were said to be good friends at the Ligue 1 club. They follow one another on social media and regularly like each other's posts.",
      "Should Yoro need some help, Bryan Mbeumo and Andre Onana both play alongside Baleba for Cameroon. If they were to become team-mates again, though, it'd be on Brighton's terms.",

      "Benjamin Sesko will have to adhere to a host of new rules when he joins Manchester United. The Red Devils are closing in on a £74million deal for the RB Leipzig striker, despite competition from Newcastle.",
      "Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford over the Magpies and has told RB Leipzig chiefs of his desire. United have made a first bid - although it was lower than Newcastle's offer - and are continuing talks to strike a deal, with the Slovenia international increasingly likely to be the No.9 that Ruben Amorim has chased for much of the summer.",
      "However, the 22-year-old may be in for a stark wake-up call should he arrive in the northwest, given how Amorim has wasted no time in laying down the law since his own arrival last November. The Portuguese tactician has implemented a number of new rules since taking over from Erik ten Hag, with hopes of turning the tide at United.",
      "The first major rule that the 40-year-old implemented upon his arrival was banning his coaches from dishing out complex instructions, with the ideology that things need to be simplified before they are passed down.",
      "He also decided to ban players from using international breaks as holiday opportunities, after Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetted off to the United States in November for leisure after being left out of their respective national teams.",
      "Amorim said of the changes: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays after emphasising that he looks to prioritise physical fitness within his team, while the fourth rule that Amorim has put in place sees losing teams in training sessions forced to pick up equipment used on the day.",
      "Amorim has upped his standards ahead of the new campaign, following a disastrous Premier League campaign that saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the league standings. Diogo Dalot has stressed that the club may not be for everyone at present.",
      "Speaking about Amorim's way of doing things, the Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",
      "Amorim's side have made a decent impression in his first pre-season at the club. The Red Devils held a newly-promoted Leeds United to a goalless draw last month, before embarking on their Premier League Summer Series tour of the United States.",
      "They secured 2-1 and 4-1 wins over West Ham and Bournemouth, as well as a 2-2 draw with Everton. The side are now set to return to Old Trafford to face Fiorentina on Saturday, before their Premier League opener against Arsenal lands on August 17.",

      "Manchester United’s next transfer has been branded a “bully” by a top Premier League midfielder. With United closing in on a move for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, attention has shifted to stiffening up Ruben Amorim’s midfield.",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba has emerged as the club’s number one target. It's understood contact has already been made with the south coast club, although his arrival would need to be coupled with departures following United’s summer spending spree and United have quite the job on their hands persuading Brighton to cash in on a player they rate as being worth £100m already.",
      "The 21-year-old has been a revelation since joining the Seagulls from Lille in 2023. Aston Villa midfielder Amadou Onana was at the French club at the same time and saw a young Baleba take no prisoners when he stepped up to train with the first team.",
      "Onana told the Inside Scoop: “When I arrived, he was playing with the B team. I just saw a strong kid, he’s the strongest kid I’ve ever seen. Jacked! He used to come up [to train with the first team] and be free, he’d bully the pros.”",
      "Onana, 23, said he wasn’t surprised that Baleba is now rated so highly, as he praised his down-to-earth nature. He said: “He’s done his thing and I always knew he had what it takes to get to the high level. He’s a really good kid, really humble, works hard.”",
      "Brighton don't want to sell Baleba this year and will demand £100m given he has three years left on his contract. United value him at closer to £70m and it has been suggested that Baleba could ask the Seagulls to lower their asking price. But with Brighton preferring to sell in 2026 and planning for the upcoming campaign with him, they're unlikely to budge.",
      "Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has tried to play down the speculation surrounding Baleba. He told a fans’ forum: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",

      "First, United are looking to finalise a deal for Sesko, having lodged a bid of around £65.3m plus £8.7m in add-ons. Newcastle also want the Slovenian, but he is believed to be favouring a move to Old Trafford.",

He was rushed back from a hamstring injury for last season's Europa League final but suffered a different injury three weeks ago. After being left out of the squad that travelled to Stockholm for the pre-season opener against Leeds United last month, he was included in the squad that jetted off to the US, but he did not feature in any of United's three Premier League Summer Series outings.",
      "\"I've got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now,\" Zirkzee said during the tour. \"I've got great physios working with me every day. It's not a serious problem. It's pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",

      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has been pictured in Manchester as he prepares to complete his transfer to Manchester United this week.",
      "The Slovenian became United's top priority once Bryan Mbeumo had joined from Brentford. Unlike the Mbeumo negotiations, it appears that the Reds have managed to complete a deal with the Bundesliga side much quicker.",
      "Despite competition from Newcastle for his signature, United have managed to persuade Sesko that their project is greater and it has been widely reported that United have agreed an initial £66m fee for the striker. Upon reaching an agreement with Leipzig, the club have worked quickly to get Sesko to the UK.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, Sesko was pictured by the German media boarding a private jet in Leipzig ahead of his imminent arrival at United. Now, the forward has been spotted heading into the airport terminal building having arrived at Manchester Airport.",
      "With this not being deadline day, there is less pressure on United and Sesko to complete the necessary paperwork and medical on Thursday evening. Instead, it will be expected that the centre-forward will complete these formalities at Carrington on Friday ahead of a potential announcement Saturday, prior to the pre-season fixture against Fiorentina.",
      "United have often used home matches to unveil new signings to their supporters. Rasmus Hojlund was presented to supporters at Old Trafford while Ayden Heaven and Patrick Dorgu received the same treatment in the January transfer window.",
      "Should Sesko complete his move this week, he will be in line to make his debut for the club against Arsenal on August 17. The Gunners were credited with interest in the Slovenian during the summer transfer window but eventually abandoned their pursuit after welcoming Viktor Gyokeres to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Ironically, Gyokeres is a player that United's head coach Ruben Amorim knows well having signed him from Coventry City and developed him into Sporting's talisman.",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, Manchester United have had no choice but to attack in this summer's transfer window.",
      "A bottom half finish, a trophyless campaign and another season that featured more upheaval off the pitch meant United signed off for the summer with very little optimism for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao ended United's hopes of qualifying for this season's Champions League, meaning they will be without European football for the first time since 2014/15 this term.",
      "The biggest concern immediately raised on the back of United's failure to qualify for Europe's premier club competition was about this summer's window. With no European football on offer, it was feared United could find life difficult in the market.",
      "Instead, with just under four weeks to go until the September 1 deadline, United are still in with a chance of having their strongest summer window in years - and much of it stems from rolling back the years and readopting a former blueprint.",
      "Having finished last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings in this summer's transfer window, so far bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "The duo were among the Premier League's best players last season, scoring 35 league goals between them. United wasted no time in signing Cunha, triggering his £62.5million release clause on the opening day of the window, before setting their sights on Mbeumo and eventually getting him through the door last month.",
      "Cunha, who is well-versed in a three-at-the-back system, is a tailor-made fit for the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's team, whereas Mbeumo offers a multifunctional option in the attacking department. Both players are goalscorers and were linked with moves to Premier League clubs that could have offered them Champions League football this coming season before putting pen to paper on long-term deals at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha, who finalised his move to United on June 12, became the first attacker United had signed from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent basis since Alexis Sanchez arrived from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "United were big spenders in the 2017/18 campaign, making four statement signings, of which three already played in the Premier League. Prior to signing Sanchez in the mid-season window, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic arrived from Everton and Chelsea respectively ahead of the start of the season.",
      "Since signing the aforementioned trio, United have not signed three Premier League players in the same window. However, that could change before the end of this window amid their interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Despite making attacking signings a priority this summer, United are desperate to strengthen their midfield before the bell sounds at the start of next month. They lack energy and aggression in the middle of the pitch, making the addition of a new midfielder vitally important.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined Brighton from Lille in 2023 and has gone from strength-to-strength ever since, becoming one of the most exciting youngsters in the Premier League. According to The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton via intermediaries.",
      "Although the Cameroonian is only 21 and has just 61 Premier League appearances to his name, he has quickly proven he is a quality operator at this level. He was one of the best all-round midfielders in the division last season, demonstrating he can provide the traits United are desperately lacking in the engine room.",
      "Baleba, who has previously addressed his hunger for winning silverware, is another example of Brighton's fabulous scouting system. The Seagulls are the masters of unearthing hidden gems, polishing them and selling them on for a handsome profit.",
      "Although no transfer offers the guarantee of success, there is less risk involved when signing players who are already proven in the league you need them to perform in. Cunha and Mbeumo are statement signings for United, and Baleba would be the same if he were to end up at Old Trafford.",
      "After taking one too many gambles on overseas imports in recent years, it has been refreshing to see United roll back the years this summer. Mbeumo and Cunha are excellent additions and have the necessary qualities to thrive in M16, meaning Baleba could potentially follow suit.",
      "This particular approach rarely let Ferguson down.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of completing their fourth major signing of the summer with Benjamin Sesko in England to finalise the transfer.",
      "Should the move go as expected, Sesko will join Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in joining the Reds in Manchester this summer. The arrival of the Slovenian is seen as a statement of intent by United considering the competition from Champions League bound Newcastle.",
      "Of course, Sesko's imminent arrival has led to questions about the future of one man in particular. MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the rumours swirling around Rasmus Hojlund and the club in general this summer.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Milan club are now prioritising a move for Hojlund ahead of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic this summer. It is believed that AC would like the deal to be a loan with an option to purchase the Dane next summer.",
      "Hojlund's stock remains high in Italy thanks to his spell at Atalanta before joining United. It is claimed that AC could look to include an option to buy worth as much as £30m in 2026.",
      "What MEN Sport says: We understand that there is an acceptance in Hojlund's camp that he may have to leave this summer should Sesko be signed to take his place in the squad. Were he to leave, a move back to Serie A could be ideal for him. Like United, AC are a historic club with a huge fanbase and the Dane could see this as the perfect team to rebuild his career. With the World Cup on the horizon, Hojlund needs to play and it just does not seem like he will do that at Old Trafford this season so why not move back to Italy.",
      "In an interview with Quotidiano Sportivo, Fiorentina defender Pietro Comuzzo has explained why he is happy to stay at the Italian club despite transfer links to United. \"The contract renewal was a strong signal from the club, a demonstration of respect,\" he explained.",
      "\"President [Rocco] Commisso is a wonderful person, and I have a special bond with him. When my mother passed away, he was one of the first to come and console me.",
      "\"This is also why I’m happy to have stayed here, in a city that is a second home to me.\"",
      "What MEN Sport says: Comuzzo is a player that is highly thought of in Italy and at only 20, he has a bright future ahead of him. However, the links to United have not been particularly strong as a centre-back is unlikely to be a top priority when other areas of the squad needed the finances more. Bringing in a goalkeeper is arguably more important than signing a centre-back but even that deal is subject to Altay Bayindir leaving. Perhaps United could go in for Comuzzo next summer - it will be interesting to see if this develops.",

      "Chelsea, on the other hand, have had no trouble bolstering their attack. The Blues have added Liam Delap, Joao Pedro and are currently in talks with Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Arsenal are predicted to finish second for the fourth consecutive year - a forecast that is unlikely to please Mikel Arteta. Despite significant investment in the squad, including the addition of Viktor Gyokeres as his No.9, Arteta may still fall short of the title he so desperately seeks, with pressure mounting.",
      "Manchester City had a disappointing season last term and are facing their first year without Kevin De Bruyne in a decade. Despite bolstering their squad, Shearer doesn't believe Pep Guardiola and his team will reclaim their crown, instead placing them third in his predictions.",
      "Nottingham Forest, last year's dark horse, will need to juggle domestic commitments with European commitments, either in the Europa League or the UEFA Conference League. Their fate depends on the outcome of Crystal Palace’s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a Europa League spot.",
      "Despite this new challenge, Shearer is confident they will remain in the top half of the table. Tottenham, having dismissed Ange Postecoglou despite his European triumphs, are entering a new phase.",
      "Thomas Frank faces a daunting task, but Shearer believes they will secure an eighth-place finish, just behind Aston Villa. The West Midlands club, who benefit from Unai Emery's leadership, are predicted to slip due to intense competition at the top.",
      "Brentford, now under Keith Andrews' management, are tipped to narrowly escape relegation, finishing just above the bottom three in 17th place. West Ham, with Graham Potter entering his first full season in charge, are also expected to face a challenging year.",
      "For clubs like Everton and Palace, it's another year of comfortable mid-table football. Fulham, Wolves and Bournemouth are expected to stay relatively safe.",
      "Brighton, sitting at tenth, might have anticipated more under Fabian Hurzeler. Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland have all made their return to the top flight.",
      "They'll be keen to break the recent pattern of promoted teams being relegated straight back to the Championship. However, Shearer predicts that all three clubs will only enjoy a single year in the Premier League before returning to the second tier.",

      "Manchester United's priority in the transfer market all summer has been resolving last season's goalscoring woes.",
      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last term than United, and three of them ended up being relegated to the Championship.",
      "But with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and their pursuit of Benjamin Sesko looking like it is going to reach a successful conclusion, attention over the last 24 hours has turned towards what is next for United in the transfer market.",
      "It is hardly a secret that Ruben Amorim wants more dynamism in his midfield and after the departure of Christian Eriksen this summer, United need another body in midfield to compete with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo for a starting place.",
      "And their search has seemingly taken them towards Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba who is said to be a leading target for United this summer.",
      "The 21-year-old is an international teammate of United stars Mbeumo and Andre Onana and has impressed at Premier League level for the Seagulls across the last couple of seasons.",
      "His mentality and attitude are credited among his biggest strengths and, on the evidence of what we have seen during his time at the Amex Stadium, he is exactly the kind of player Amorim covets in his midfield.",
      "The problem is Brighton owner Tony Bloom is renowned as a master negotiator and a tough seller. Brighton have negotiated large fees for the likes of Moises Caicedo, Joao Pedro, Yves Bissouma, Marc Cucurella, Alexis Mac Allister and Ben White in recent seasons.",
      "Baleba will be a difficult and expensive transfer to make and while he may be one of United's top targets, they may well be forced to seek possible alternatives.",
      "With that in mind, using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Baleba, one of the top results is a little-known German midfielder who has been a revelation for Freiburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Patrick Osterhage joined the German side from Bochum last summer and made 30 league appearances last term to help his side almost qualify for the Champions League.",
      "The 25-year-old was seen as an astute buy and his ability to screen the back four at the base of their midfield was one of the big reasons behind their success last term.",
      "Speaking after his arrival at the Europa-Park Stadion, Freiburg sporting director Klemens Hartenbach not only praised his ability on the pitch but also cited his character away from the field as a big reason as to why they chose to sign him.",
      "\"We’ve had our eye on Patrick for a number of years,\" Hartenbach said.",
      "\"When he was younger, he battled through tough times thanks to his remarkable attitude. He can play anywhere in the midfield and we’re convinced that he still has a lot of potential.",
      "\"Patrick can pass well, but also likes to shoot himself. He’ll be a great addition to the side given his dynamism, pace and excellent stamina. We’re really excited.\"",
      "And while Osterhage's physical qualities would appeal to Amorim, that attitude is something the United boss is demanding from his United side.",
      "\"It is a key point in our way to do things now,\" Amorim said when discussing why United signed Mbeumo and Cunha this summer.",
      "\"It's not just how they play, it's really important of course, but the character is really important.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to know the players, to talk with everybody before we bring a player to our group. That is going to be massive in our decision to bring players.\"",
      "Transfermarkt value him at £8.68million and given he has the qualities Amorim seeks from new arrivals, he could prove to be an absolute steal as a possible Baleba alternative.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

Baleba, 21, is an all-action defensive midfielder with his best years well ahead of him, and could add aggression and energy to the engine room.",
      "Signing Baleba would be very expensive, over £100m according to TBR Football, and some fans think that a deal should only be done for a considerably smaller fee. Brighton have done a roaring trade in recent years by buying young prospects from around the world and developing them into elite players, and then banking significant sums from top clubs.",
      "Some fans say that getting another top \"Premier League proven\" player in is exactly the sort of business that Manchester United should be doing - even if absences down to Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) participation is something to contend with. Reader Fanaticmanufan says: \"Bottom line is that we need a player of this calibre. If he goes to the Africa Cup of Nations, then Casemiro and Ugarte will need to cover this position!\"",
      "Commenter Icemu writes: \"We desperately need someone like Baleba.\" Un4u agrees: \"Please, we need Carlos in the team.\"",
      "Crazyeighty8 says: \"I dont know the Brighton lad but he looks like the type of midfielder we should buy, but never do. Today you need a player in the middle that's strong and athletic, we constantly get out-fought in midfield by mid-table or lower teams.\"",
      "The price will be a sticking point for Cantonalives: \"Thought SJR wanted to find players before they became really expensive... Happy enough with the summer activity so far, but frustrated how Brighton keep unearthing gems that turn into expensive players, when we do things the other way round.\"",
      "Cromwellswart responds: \"Hopefully, the Leon, Dorgu, Chido, Heaven and Kone signings is proof that the club are trying to unearth the rough diamonds. They're certainly proving promising so far. What we need to remember is that players will sign for clubs like Brighton knowing they can flourish and develop without the 24/7 pressure and bright lights of Old Trafford, and that players like Moises Caicedo may choose the Brightons and the Brentfords for that reason.\"",
      "Kevmal says: \"Baleba is a perfect fit for Utd, but way overpriced. 45m at best.\"",
      "DAVES writes: \"It's become apparent that Ugarte simply isn't good enough & must be replaced. Baleba ticks every box, but he won't come cheap.\"",
      "On our Facebook page, James Ikyerga writes: \"MU stands in good stead to buy him. They have splashed the cash on average players in the past. The player is damn good.\"",
      "Daffodial Maisamara isn't so keen: \"It will cost too much, and the sad thing is he will miss many games, just use what you've got.\"",

      "Manchester United are eyeing up a potential summer move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba. Ruben Amorim's side are in the market for a new central midfielder and Baleba, 21, has emerged as a top target for that position.",
      "The Cameroon international has three years left on his contract and United have contacted Brighton through intermediaries to explore a move to Old Trafford. The Reds are understood to be among the several suitors and interest is building in the ex-Lille man, who has impressed since his move to the Premier League in 2023.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, do not want to sell him until at least next summer. There is also a recognition that a move to United now might be unrealistic, especially if the Reds get a deal over the line for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Unless United are able to secure a number of lucrative sales, they are not expected to be able to afford a move for Baleba this summer. He is said to have a £100million release clause in his Brighton contract.",
      "But if United can sell a raft of players and sign Baleba, he would complete a 'dream' midfield for Amorim next season. Baleba would slot into the No.6 position in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "Next to Baleba in central midfield would be Bruno Fernandes. Yes, the Portugal international's best and preferred role is the more advanced No.10, but with new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo expected to be used as the two attacking midfielders, Fernandes is set to drop into a deeper position.",
      "A midfield two of Baleba and Fernandes has the potential to be among the best in the Premier League, that is for sure. Ahead of them would therefore be Cunha and Mbeumo with Sesko as the No.9.",
      "How would that leave the other midfielders in the United squad? Well, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte should be kept for much-needed competition, as should Mason Mount, who can be used anywhere across the midfield.",
      "However, in order to fund a move for Baleba, Kobbie Mainoo could be sold. The 21-year-old doesn't have a clear role in Amorim's system and United would be able to fetch around £70m for his services.",
      "It's a deal that would make sense all-round. United would make pure profit on a big-money asset and Mainoo would have the chance to be used in a more suited role somewhere else, such as Chelsea.",
      "Toby Collyer is the other first-team midfielder named in the United squad not mentioned thus far, but he would be kept as back-up and competition in case the Reds get a series of injuries throughout the season.",

      "According to a report by The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton, via intermediaries, to explore the possibility of bringing him to Old Trafford.",
      "Despite prioritising attacking signings so far this summer, United remain in the market for a midfielder ahead of the transfer window closing on September 1. Baleba was excellent for the Seagulls last season, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's most highly-rated youngsters.",
      "Capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, the 21-year-old would provide the energy, aggression and ball-carrying expertise United sorely lack in midfield. However, it remains to be seen if United will be able to fund a deal for him amid their ongoing pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Signed from Lille in August 2023, Baleba has gone from strength-to-strength in Brighton colours, producing a collection of eye-catching midfield performances. His all-round game makes him a very attractive player.",
      "Taking inspiration from Manchester City midfield star Rodri, Baleba revealed in May that he has ambitions of winning the Ballon d'Or in the future, admitting he has earned encouragement from Premier League colleagues, including United ace Cunha.",
      "\"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me,\" Baleba told The Sun earlier this summer. \"I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.",
      "\"I watched him during the Euros and before his injury I played against him and time I got the ball, he was right in front of me. It was my first game against Manchester City, and it was very difficult.",

      "On the cusp of spending £75m to land Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, and having already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbuemo for a combined £132.5m, Manchester United have not been shy about spending this summer.",
      "While the ability of a side that finished last season in the Premier League fifth from bottom, and has no lucrative European football to look forward to this coming season may have been questioned by rival fans, the explanation is a pretty simple one.",
      "Manchester United remains one of the world’s biggest sporting teams, not just football teams, sporting teams. They rank alongside the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Lakers when it comes to size and scale, dwarfing some of those in terms of actual revenue.",
      "United remains a big business. They are a global football brand that has fans that run deep into the hundreds of millions. That means that there is always cash coming into the business and, even with some fallow years in terms of competitive success, as long as they remain PSR compliant, which they have been, with accounts submitted being for Red Football Limited as opposed to Manchester United Plc, then they can spend.",
      "It gets more challenging and more fraught with risk the longer they spend outside of the Champions League, but it is a brand built over decades, and that means that they remain a big fish. The fact that they continue to have pull for top players even without Champions League football should be instructive.",
      "But some of the risks attached to being such a big side still and being able to pay the big money, something which co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously bemoaned before this summer splurge, are that the large number of players that still sit on their books and are no longer part of the Ruben Amorim vision are hard to shift to anywhere else but the Premier League, and selling talent to rivals isn’t normally the preferred course of action.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been heading for the Old Trafford exit for some time, with Amorim clear that he is not part of his plans. But on wages that while nowhere near the £250,000/£300,000 mark of some of his teammates, are still far above what many top sides outside of England can pay, it becomes a small market.",
      "Previous suitors have been told, according to The Athletic, that £70m is the valuation on Garnacho. That may be what United want, but it is hard to see that is what they are going to get because there will be few options available to try and get a bidding war going. Outside of the Premier League’s bigger sides, Spanish giants Real Madrid, Bayern Munich of the Bundesliga and the Saudi Pro League, the likes of Italy and France, save for Paris Saint-Germain who have moved away from that model in recent times, cannot play in that space.",
      "The broadcasting revenues in Spain, Germany, Italy and France are dwarfed by the Premier League, and only clubs such as Madrid and Bayern, as well as Barcelona when they finally get their house in order after the pandemic hit them badly, can lay claim to generating revenues in line with Premier League sides, even those in the bottom half.",
      "That makes shifting players difficult. Twenty years ago it would have been a normal sight to see the likes of AC Milan, Juventus or Internazionale in the running for top talent, but those clubs have fallen so far behind the Premier League in revenue terms that they cannot be active participants in that market. Sure, the odd loan happens here and there, but it is often heavily subsidised on the wage side and requires some give from the players to leave world football’s elite domestic league.",
      "Marcus Rashford would have been sold before now if there was a fully functioning market. But his huge wages mean that few could afford both the salary and the fee required. Barcelona have opted to take a punt on the deal in the knowledge that if it works out then his value will be far lower next summer due to him being a year out from the end of his contract.",
      "But then there is Garnacho. His behaviour creates some red flags for recruitment teams in the Premier League and that will have hurt his value proposition. United may posture about wanting £70m, but there will be a lot of room for negotiation as they know his value won’t be increasing over the next 12 months if he doesn’t play, and his wages will be a burden. They need a suitor, and with the player wanting to stay in the Premier League, Chelsea offers them the chance to sell, and they know that as an academy graduate he represents pure profit from an accounting standpoint.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another example. United want to offload but there are few clubs able to come to the table to offer the kind of money that United want and the player wants. Players don’t like taking pay cuts, especially hefty ones, regardless of how much they are on. It impacts the leverage they have when it comes to contract negotiations in the future if they accept less than what it was deemed at one stage their value was.",
      "Players like Rasmus Hojlund are also difficult to sell. United vastly overpaid for the Danish striker when they signed him from Atalanta in the summer of 2023 for a fee that could rise up to £72m if all conditions were met. Report suggest that the club would now accept £30m, and that would barely recoup the remaining book value he has.",
      "Paying good money for players is something that is afforded to the biggest clubs. The best players cost the biggest fees, but it isn’t always the case that the bigger the fee the more guaranteed success is.",
      "United have spent a lot. There is obvious wisdom in signing Cunha and Mbeumo, Premier League proven, albeit for two players who at 26 and 27 likely won’t carry enormous resale value in three or four years' time. Sesko has no Premier League experience but has a far greater chance of a big resale value or recouping funds if it goes awry.",
      "But the whole ecosystem continues to be buoyed by the Premier League, with the occasional Saudi side stepping in to offer big wages for fading lights. United’s pursuit of Carlos Baleba from Brighton & Hove Albion is an obvious long-term play, but without moving on some of the high earners from previous regimes, where structure and strategy was absent, then it is hard to press the reset button truly.",
      "Whoever took the reins at United needed time. It is a big job to turn around. But the past in the market should provide some lessons, and the club will have to be mindful that when it comes to moving on mistakes in the market, the options are limited, and that is a result of the willingness of United and others to meet huge demands that have made the system deeply flawed.",

      "Baleba has three years left on his current deal at the AMEX Stadium and is one of the most sought-out youngsters in his position after moving to Lille. It's understood that Brighton want to keep the Cameroon international for at least another year while United need to sell players to afford further additions.",
      "On Wednesday evening, Brighton held their annual pre-season Fans' Forum with head coach Fabian Hurzeler and Barber taking questions ahead of the new Premier League season. Asked if this summer would be the right time to sell the 21-year-old, Barber revealed an insight into the current situation regarding Baleba and United.",
      "After Hurzeler jokingly seemed to avoid the question for Barber to answer, the Seagulls chief, via BBC Sussex, said: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players.",
      "\"Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Old Trafford icon Rio Ferdinand has heaped praise on Harry Maguire, saying he \"rose from the dead\" under Ruben Amorim. The experienced defender joined Manchester United back in 2019, but his time in Manchester has not exactly been smooth.",
      "Maguire was a significant factor in the club's eighth-place Premier League finish under Erik ten Hag in the 2023/24 season. Consequently, the 32-year-old faced a barrage of criticism for his on-field performances from supporters, pundits and former club greats alike.",
      "Maguire found himself sidelined under Ten Hag, at one point seemingly deemed unnecessary by the Dutchman. However, the Sheffield-born star managed to claw his way back into the squad and deliver some remarkable individual displays despite United ending last season 15th in the league.",
      "As a result, it seems Maguire is now part of Amorim's plans for the upcoming season. Although his contract expires next summer, and despite interest from three Premier League clubs and two Italian teams, it appears increasingly likely Maguire will remain at United.",
      "All five transfer enquiries were ultimately rebuffed by United, according to The Daily Mail. It is reported Maguire is eager to sign another extension, which could see him retire at Old Trafford. While the club are believed to be in agreement with that line of thinking, no formal discussions have commenced as yet.",
      "Speaking about Maguire's career revival on his Rio Presents podcast alongside Joel Beya, Ferdinand was swift to commend the player's character and determination. That's despite facing scrutiny from football figures far and wide, including Ferdinand himself.",
      "\"I ain't got that bad energy energy for players or for the club, I want them to do well,\" said the ex-England defender. \"But if they don't play well, I'm gonna say what I see, and I had that discussion with Harry Maguire.",
      "\"We had the tough questions like that, 'What's it like you having criticism?' And someone who [has] risen from the dead almost, shown character. He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",
      "Maguire's choice to stay at Old Trafford last summer despite Ten Hag's stance has clearly reaped rewards. Amorim has subsequently discovered a place in the squad for the former club skipper, granting him a one-year contract extension in January.",
      "Beyond that, Amorim has also incorporated Maguire into a six-man leadership collective alongside Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui as he seeks to harness the transfer of knowledge from experienced players to younger squad members.",
      "Speaking about the group, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "Maguire has also impressed during United's pre-season tour of the United States, featuring in the team's 4-1 victory against Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series. It remains to be seen whether he will be selected when United take on Fiorentina in their final pre-season friendly at Old Trafford on Saturday, which will also mean a reunion with David De Gea.",
      "Their Premier League campaign kicks off the following Sunday (Aug 17) with a clash against Arsenal. Maguire could come up against former Red Devils target Viktor Gyokeres, whom Amorim is familiar with from their time together at Sporting CP.",

      "Manchester United are closing in on a young striker for a fee in excess of £70million for the second time in two years.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund did not arrive with Premier League experience and his time at Old Trafford has not gone as hoped. There is also no guarantee that Benjamin Sesko will succeed in England.",
      "United are rolling the dice with Sesko after Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale this summer. Watkins would have been a similar signing to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who are both established Premier League players, but talks are advancing with RB Leipzig over a move for Sesko.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7) in add-ons in an attempt to sign Sesko. Newcastle have offered a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but the player's preference is set to be decisive.",
      "The expectation is that United and Leipzig will agree on a slightly higher fee than the initial bid.",
      "Fans who have been season-ticket holders at Old Trafford for years will wonder how paying such a significant fee for a raw striker is now considered normal, but the modern market is grossly inflated.",
      "United will essentially pay the going rate for one of the most promising young forwards in Europe, but they are investing in potential and Hojlund is an example of the danger of those deals.",
      "Watkins would have been a safer bet at a time when Ruben Amorim can not afford to take risks. Watkins has scored 75 goals in 184 appearances in the Premier League and demonstrated his quality with England at Euro 2024.",
      "There would have been a higher chance of Watkins hitting the ground running at United, but that point is redundant when Aston Villa always seemed destined to say he wasn't for sale.",
      "In comparison, Sesko had earmarked this summer for a move away from Leipzig and Arsenal were the front-runners to sign him at the start of the window. Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyökeres from Sporting Lisbon instead, which opened the door for United and Newcastle to battle it out for Sesko.",
      "It doesn't make much sense to harp on about Watkins being more suited to a transfer to United than Sesko because one player wasn't for sale, and the other player was up for grabs.",
      "Having said that, concerns can be voiced about Sesko's move. He is younger than Hojlund and will need time to adapt in the Premier League. Will history repeat itself and the pressure of leading the attack become a burden on Sesko's shoulders? It's possible his time at United will be similar to Hojlund's.",
      "On the other hand, it's entirely possible that Sesko is better equipped to succeed at Old Trafford and makes an immediate impact, scoring goals and providing presence in the opposition box.",
      "Amorim will desperately hope it's the latter. United's head coach needs a dependable goalscorer and Sesko should be targeting 15 goals in his first season.",
      "Christopher Vivell has been crucial in the proposed deal for Sesko, to the extent that Sesko will feel like a 'Vivell signing'. United's director of recruitment oversaw the signing of Sesko during his stint at Leipzig and holds him in high regard.",
      "And when Leipzig signed Sesko in the summer of 2022, Vivell said: \"Sesko is among the top international talents and has enormous potential to become a top player as well. He has everything it takes, is extremely fast, has tremendous jumping ability, and is very strong in the air.\"",
      "Vivell believes Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers, but United sources said the same when Hojlund arrived from Atalanta in a deal worth £72million two years ago.",
      "It will be a disaster if Sesko isn't a success in Manchester, given that his profile is similar to Hojlund's, albeit he has shown more than Hojlund did before his move to United.",
      "Sesko has 39 goals in 87 appearances for RB Leipzig and his record for Slovenia (16 goals in 41 games) is encouraging. Sesko was a livewire at Euro 2024 and his explosiveness will help him in the Premier League.",
      "The 22-year-old could prove to be an outstanding signing if he continues to develop in the next few seasons. Sesko obviously comes with risk but there is plenty of potential there.",
      "Every United fan will be hoping lightning does not strike twice.",

      "Danny Welbeck tipped Carlos Baleba to become one of the best in his position, before Manchester United identified him as a transfer target.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has been busy enhancing his attack this summer but is now shifting focus to midfield reinforcements. The Red Devils kicked off their transfer activity by acquiring Matheus Cunha from Wolves for a hefty £62.5million, followed by a £71m outlay on Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, with 18-year-old defensive talent Diego Leon joining in the midst of those signings.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is nearing a high-profile switch to Old Trafford. It appears once a deal for the RB Leipzig ace is finalised, United may well pursue Baleba, who has been a shining light for Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "He has previously caught the attention of Chelsea in the past, impressing with his performances under Fabian Hurzeler. His abilities have not only caught United's interest but also earned praise from team-mate and Red Devils academy graduate Welbeck.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio Sussex in November last year, Welbeck shared his views on the 21-year-old midfielder. The former Arsenal player said: \"He can be unstoppable.",
      "\"If he keeps up with that desire and passion, he can go right to the top. He's got all of the attributes to be a world-beater.\"",
      "Welbeck isn't the only ex-United player taken with Baleba's talent. Rio Ferdinand has also expressed his desire to see the young midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "On his Rio Presents podcast, the former England and United captain said: \"I'm being greedy, and [if] we are able to shift the other players that are surplus to requirements, I'd be going for Baleba in midfield.",
      "\"[He] beats the press on a regular basis. [He's] confident on the ball. [He] can move, is mobile. He is a Ruben Amorim midfielder.\"",
      "The Athletic reports United have initiated talks with Brighton regarding Baleba, but they would need to offload some players deemed surplus, like Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, before tabling a significant offer for him. With three years remaining on his contract, Brighton are in a strong position to command a hefty fee for Baleba.",
      "Previously, the Seagulls received a record-breaking £115m from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo. Brighton might ask for a similar amount for Baleba, although United reportedly value him closer to £70m.",
      "Brighton's chief executive Paul Barber, when quizzed about United's interest in Baleba at a fan event, said: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [head coach Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "The match will see more than 50,000 fans in attendance, with De Gea making his return to the club where he spent 12 years. He left United on a free transfer in the summer of 2023, and joined Fiorentina a year later.",
      "Ahead of the match, De Gea has hinted at his excitement, writing: “See you soon,” to the official United X (formerly Twitter) account.",
      "It seems Fernandes shares that excitement.The midfielder has shared a United post on his Instagram stories, and added the caption: “See you soon my friend @d_degeaofficial.”",
      "Fernandes has also replied to De Geas’ latest post on Instagram with “Mi Portero”, which translates into English as “My goalkeeper.”",
      "They’re not the only messages that Fernandes has sent De Gea about his return to Old Trafford. In a video shared on United’s official social media accounts, he says: “David my friend. Can’t wait to see you at The Snapdragon Cup. Hope you enjoy being back at Old Trafford to see your fans, to see your hours, to see your home.",
      "“At the same time, I hope I score some goals against you and we enjoy the day together. See you soon my friend.”",
      "The game against United will be Fiorentina’s third in England over the last few weeks. They fell to a 2-0 defeat against Leicester City last Sunday, a game in which De Gea was left on the bench.",

Despite fierce interest from Newcastle United, Sesko is understood to prefer a transfer to Old Trafford. And with Manchester United reportedly resuming discussions with Leipzig on Thursday, an agreement could soon be reached.",
      "Nevertheless, the 22-year-old might face a rude awakening should he arrive in the northwest, considering how Ruben Amorim has been swift to establish his authority since his own appointment last November.",
      "The Portuguese manager has introduced several fresh regulations since replacing Erik ten Hag, aiming to reverse United's fortunes. The primary rule that the 40-year-old enforced upon his arrival was prohibiting his coaching staff from delivering complicated instructions, believing that matters must be streamlined before being communicated.",
      "He also chose to prevent players from treating international breaks as vacation periods, following Marcus Rashford and Casemiro's trip to the United States in November for relaxation after being omitted from their respective national squads, reports the Mirror.",
      "Amorim commented on the alterations, saying: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim has also outlawed food in the changing room on matchdays after stressing that he wants to focus on physical fitness within his squad, whilst the fourth rule that Amorim has implemented sees defeated teams in training sessions compelled to collect equipment used during the session.",
      "He's raised his expectations ahead of the new season, following a catastrophic Premier League campaign that witnessed the Red Devils finish 15th in the table. Diogo Dalot has emphasised that the club might not suit everyone at this time.",
      "Discussing Amorim's approach, the Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",

      "The Red Devils were held by newly-promoted Leeds United to a scoreless draw last month, before beginning their Premier League Summer Series tour of the United States. They claimed 2-1 and 4-1 victories over West Ham and Bournemouth respectively, alongside a 2-2 draw with Everton.",

      "Manchester United know what they have to do to complete a deal that could lead to them being taken somewhat seriously again. And Liverpool may or may not want a PSG forward…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nNewcastle have taken another gargantuan L.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nThe Brazil winger is being linked with Liverpool too but no-one’s heart is really in it – yet. We get the sense that Arsenal and Liverpool would be happy to take him, and Real Madrid would be willing to sell, but finding common ground over a price might be tricky. And the player seems to want to stay. If anything happens around Rodrygo, it feels like a late one. Arsenal certainly need a winger and Liverpool want another attacker if Nunez leaves.",

      "",
      "18) 🔼 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nHaving missed out on Sesko, Newcastle have been linked to Jackson more than any other striker. The Blues’ asking price is £80-100m or £60m, depending on who you believe. According to Craig Hope, the Magpies striker shortlist is: Jackson, Rodrigo Muniz, Ollie Watkins, Jorgen Strand Larsen, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Lois Openda and Goncalo Ramos.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nOoh. Baleba would make United a very passable football team. It emerged on Wednesday evening that the Red Devils had reached out to Brighton via intermediaries to suss the midfielder’s situation. Word hadn’t reached Brighton chief-exec Paul Barber by that point but it seems that the Seagulls would want something like £100million including add-ons, while United would open at £70million. That’s a big gap to bridge, especially when United don’t do this well and they are dealing with Brighton as reluctant sellers. Baleba, though, is keen to hear what United have to offer and his signing would be a bigger statement of intent than Sesko.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet.",

      "",
      "8) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United…",
      "",
      "5) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Mads Hermansen – Leicester to West Ham\nIt was going to be Big John Victor, but the “disgraceful” Hammers transfer team shifted to original number-one target Hermansen at the eleventh hour. Poor John. West Ham are reportedly closing in on the Leicester ‘keeper for £18m.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",
      "",
      "2) Evann Guessand – Nice to Aston Villa\nThe Villans have been linked quite a bit but an agreement with Nice came out of nowhere in the end. The Nice striker was in the Midlands on Wednesday for a medical will join for £30.5m, which could open the door for Watkins to depart.",

      "1) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko has chosen United over Newcastle after both clubs submitted their offers to Leipzig. It looks like a win for United but we remain to be convinced…",

      "Chelsea have opened talks to sign Alejandro Garnacho from Manchester United in what they hope will be a ‘cut-price’ deal for the winger.",
      "That is the claim by talkSPORT, who suggest the London club have stepped up their pursuit of the wantaway player.",
      "It is claimed Chelsea value Garnacho at around £30m and have waited until later in the transfer window to make a move in the hope that United will drop their asking price for a player who clearly has no future at the club.",
      "Back in January, Chelsea were one of two clubs interested in the 21-year-old, but United’s valuation of £60m was deemed too high. His subsequent falling out with Ruben Amorim, as well as being one of five players to tell the club he wants to leave, has made him available for a much lower fee.",
      "A loan with an obligation to buy is also not ruled out, with Chelsea and United having done similar business with Jadon Sancho. In that instance, Chelsea opted to pay a £5m penalty rather than the £25m agreed fee to permanently sign the Dortmund winger.",
      "Manchester United have been looking to sell Garnacho all summer, and that desire will only increase with the expected arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Having beaten Newcastle to the punch, the Old Trafford club are reported to have tabled a bid worth up to £73.8m for the Slovenian striker.",
      "The return of Sancho to Old Trafford, as well as the anti-doping violation ban for Mykhailo Mudryk, has left Chelsea short on the left wing despite a summer of signings.",
      "The London club have already purchased Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, and Estevao to strengthen their front line.",

      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "As Manchester United close in on their new striker, who may prove to be the answer to their goalscoring woes but has more than a whiff of the Rasmus Hojlunds about him, David Ornstein revealed on Wednesday night that ‘contact’ has been made over a signing which will raise genuine concern among rivals that Amorim may actually have a passable football team to work with next season.",
      "While there can be no one missing piece to a puzzle which remains strewn across the living room floor, with a corner or two thought to have been eaten by the dog and others sucked up by the hoover, Carlos Baleba can be the centre-piece to bring the still disparate Manchester United together and grant supporters at least an idea of what a final image might look like.",
      "We’ve already questioned United’s linear transfer strategy this summer – the logic in completing one signing before moving onto the next rather than multi-tasking, to the point where Sesko has missed pre-season and any other additions look unlikely to join before the start of the campaign – but also, why this order when the midfield problem was so glaringly apparent under Amorim last term, having predated him for well over a decade.",
      "Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro have been signed for a not-so-small fortune, with not one single person convinced Manuel Ugarte is any sort of answer for United as the latest in that string of frankly terrible signings to occupy one of the positions in their laughably unstable midfield pivot. If only they had used the Harry Maguire money on Declan Rice.",
      "Amorim could have been describing almost any game last season as he reflected on their 0-0 draw with Leeds a couple of weeks ago.",
      "“The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes operated in one of the deeper midfield roles in that game and again in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth last week, and Sesko’s imminent arrival will see the captain take up that position in the best United XI, or at least the XI featuring all of United’s best players, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo playing ahead of him and off Sesko.",
      "That’s currently unworkable role for him. We will have to endure/be treated to the same soft-centred Red Devils, laughably at risk of being counter-attacked upon so long as any of Casemiro, Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo are forced to do the donkey work they’e either incapable of or unsuited to in order to provide Fernandes with the license to remain United’s creator-in-chief in that position.",
      "Baleba has correctly been identified as one of very few players capable of granting him that freedom. The 20-year-old made 4.22 combined tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, falling just short of Moises Caicedo (4.38), who made more in total than any midfielder other than Idrissa Gueye.",
      "United will no doubt be encouraged by Caicedo’s excellent second season for Chelsea, with the attraction of signing midfielders who have stood out for Brighton further enhanced by their continued excellence following moves to European giants, with Alexis Mac Allister a second outstanding exponent of the value in raiding the Amex following his key role in securing Liverpool their second Premier League title.",
      "United’s need for a dominant midfielder in no way makes their bid for a new striker unnecessary. No-one watching Hojlund toil last season will have any confidence in him being the No.9 who can score them 20+ goals per season.",
      "But we also think they could have muddled through without Sesko, using Cunha or Mbeumo as the central striker if need be, or just trusting they can provide enough of an uptick in creativity and quality in those inverted winger roles to bring either Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee along for the ride with them.",
      "Baleba arguably should have been their priority from the start of the transfer window, but absolutely should have been part of what will be a £200m spend from the destitute Manchester United by the time they get the Sesko deal is over the line.",
      "We’ve heard the sell-to-buy nonsense with regard to United throughout the transfer window and that’s the party line once again. ‘Unless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role,’ says Ornstein.",
      "They will come close to their greatest-ever summer spend even without securing what we’ve been told all along were the necessary sales of members of the bomb squad, so we can’t be sure they don’t have an extra £90m lying around for Baleba.",
      "But if he is indeed beyond them as things stand, it’s not too late to pull out of a move for another young, unproven striker to join the two United have already – whom the manager isn’t convinced by anyway, very reasonably preferring the experience and surety of Ollie Watkins – in favour of a midfielder who Fabrizio Romano reports Amorim quite rightly sees as the “perfect” foil for Fernandes, with the “intensity” required to make United a serious football team this season.",
      "Brighton want £104m for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who ‘is happy to stay at the Amex’ for another season, according to a report.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million.",
      "As This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, we have our doubts.",
      "The overriding argument for Watkins is pretty compelling in our eyes: guaranteed goals. That is something United have notoriously lacked in recent seasons. They re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and he provided that for a year under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. He scored 24 goals in 38 games after Edinson Cavani bagged 17 in 39 the season before.",
      "Since their successful — albeit short-term — goalscoring exploits, United changed their striker recruitment philosophy to guys for the future. And how has that gone so far? Well…",
      "Rasmus Hojlund for £68million has been nothing short of a disaster. He needed 15 games to score his first Premier League goal, which did lead to a purple patch before an injury halted his goalscoring streak. Three in his last nine top-flight games of the season at least hinted he could pick up where he left off in 2024/25.",
      "He absolutely did not. The 22-year-old Dane registered four goals and zero assists in the Premier League last season. Joshua Zirkzee was even signed to unload some of the centre-forward burden, which didn’t help.",
      "Zirkzee was another inexperienced forward with no Premier League experience brought in by the club last summer. And just like with Hojlund, it’s proving to be a poor investment. Both players are young and can easily improve — even potentially become world-class — but these two case studies should be enough proof for United that no matter how appealing the prospect of signing Sesko is, they should have resisted the urge and gone all in on Watkins.",
      "There is an argument for why that’s not the direction United should have taken — and we’ll get to that — but how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team haven’t used the Hojlund and Zirkzee evidence to ensure they don’t make the same mistake is startling. Ronaldo and Cavani are important here as well. The former was signed when he was 36 and Cavani was 33. Yet they were reliable options in front of goal, something Hojlund and Zirkzee have failed to become.",
      "Ronaldo and Cavani are not the only strikers older than Watkins (29) signed by the Red Devils who thrived at Old Trafford. There’s also Zlatan Ibrahimovic — the club’s second-best post-Sir Alex Ferguson signing — Robin van Persie, and, a long time ago, Teddy Sheringham.",
      "The fact Watkins turns 30 in December means absolutely nothing in a footballing sense. Players keep themselves in the sort of shape these days that means he could still be flying for United six years from now. But, no. In classic United fashion, they’ve gone for the flashy new toy — whose upside is huge, we know — but who also has an incredible, potentially Hojlund-esque downside.",
      "MORE ON WATKINS AND SESKO ON F365\n👉 Man Utd, Aston Villa, bad maths and Ollie Watkins ‘better than nothing’\n👉 Manchester United brief over striker shortlist and transfer ‘process’ makes them look foolish yet again\n👉 Man Utd, Liverpool embarrass Newcastle: Top 10 PIF transfer targets missed by miserable Magpies",
      "The main issue with Watkins appears to be his resale value. In that respect, the best-case scenario is that Watkins performs at a high level for a few years and Saudi Arabia come calling with a huge offer that the player wants to pursue. The worst-case scenario is that he’s pants from day one and United are stuck with another high-earning, underperforming, big-money flop. Having watched Watkins in the Premier League for the last five years, that is very unlikely. And yes, so unlikely that we are completely writing it off, which we haven’t done with the prospect of Sesko being another Hojlund (or only a little bit better).",
      "‘Resale value’ can be disregarded when the player pays you back on the pitch, and that’s what Watkins would do at Old Trafford. His worst Premier League goal return came in 2021/22, when he scored 11. That was also the only season Watkins missed more than one game across a top-flight campaign. He played 38 out of 38 last term!",
      "It’s a Manchester United decision that’s just…very Manchester United, but there is some logic to it.",
      "United’s transfer philosophy changes every summer, and the mood this year is to only sign players who really want to play for the club. Sesko fits the bill, while Watkins wasn’t aggressively pushing for the move. That’s the biggest factor for United, we think.",
      "And then there were the selling clubs. Everything we said about Watkins could be worth nothing if Aston Villa have zero intention to sell the player. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have every intention to sell Sesko — but it was always going to happen on their terms.",
      "MORE: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko: Which striker should Man Utd sign?",
      "Arsenal reportedly preferred Sesko to new signing Viktor Gyokeres but were put off by the German club’s whopping valuation of the 22-year-old Slovenian: 90 million euros.",
      "That’s around £78.5m, and it’s what Newcastle United offered Leipzig for the player. United, knowing he only wanted them, went a little under that — offering £74m. Reports suggest that offer has already been increased to match the Magpies’, such is the Red Devils’ desire to get Sesko through the door and ready for their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "The fact Leipzig are open to negotiations, and most importantly, Sesko is desperate to join, holds more weight in the United boardroom than a guaranteed success in Watkins — even if that’s what Ruben Amorim’s side are desperately crying out for.",
      "And we might be blinded by Hojlund and Zirkzee’s performances. They don’t necessarily mean that every young attacker signed by United will turn out rubbish — even if nearly all of their major signings over the last 12 years have been just that. The trend has to break at some point. Sesko certainly has the potential and current ability to be the trend-breaker.",
      "Still, the overriding point from us remains: Who is more likely to get United back in the top five? Watkins, for me, Clive. And that’s the bottom line.",

      "Manchester United have ‘made contact’ with Brighton to sound them out over a possible summer move for Carlos Baleba, according to David Ornstein.",
      "United have so far completed the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon this summer and look set to beat Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, as reported by Ornstein on Wednesday:",
      "‘Newcastle initially tabled €75million plus €5m in add-ons, before raising that on Monday to at least €80m. Within 24 hours, Manchester United made a proposal of their own worth €75m plus €10m.",
      "‘Newcastle have continued working to secure the transfer and on Tuesday a bid of €82.5m plus €2.5m was accepted by Leipzig. But Sesko wants to join Manchester United and all parties are now aware of that, as talks advance in an effort to satisfy Leipzig’s expectations. While there is no club-to-club agreement yet, the situation is moving in that direction.’",
      "A later report claimed Sesko is ‘ready to fly’ to Manchester to ‘complete his medical’ with the Leipzig striker ‘awaiting the green light’.",
      "And now Ornstein has revealed that United are interested in Baleba to fix the second of two problem positions remaining for Ruben Amorim, though he conceded that ‘unless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role’.",
      "Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia remain as members of the bomb squad seeking an exit after Marcus Rashford’s move to Barcelona, though without a transfer fee as he’s joined a season-long loan with a buy option thought to be around £25m.",
      "Ornstein claims ‘it should be known in the coming days if the situation can develop or not as United look to continue strengthening head coach Ruben Amorim’s squad’.",
      "But they have ‘made contact with Brighton, via intermediaries, to explore the conditions of a deal’ for Baleba.",
      "Brighton ‘do not intend to sanction a sale this summer’ of the player they bought from Lille in the summer of 2023 in a deal worth just under £26million, ‘but interest is building and United are among the many suitors, which has now been relayed through go-betweens’.",
      "Ornstein adds:",
      "‘Brighton made clear they favour keeping hold of the Cameroon international — who is under contract until 2028 with an option to extend by 12 months — for at least another year.",
      "‘There is also a recognition on all sides that a switch now may be unrealistic, especially if United seal their proposed move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.’",
      "Brighton want £104m for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who ‘is happy to stay at the Amex’ for another season, according to a report.",

      "United’s push to sign a new No.9 has put Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt, with the club bosses now said to be more than open to his sale.",
      "After scoring in the pre-season win over Bournemouth last week, Hojlund said: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.”",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Now it’s just about for me to sharpen myself, and I’ve done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources close to the Denmark international concede that if Hojlund is unwanted it could lift his game but, ultimately, he will have to seek a move before the transfer deadline on September 1.’",
      "Ex-Red Devils assistant Rene Meulensteen believes his former side should have instead pushed to sign Ollie Watkins.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",
      "Meulensteen added: “I look at someone like Ollie Watkins who may be available. He’s a hard-working player with similar features to Sesko, except that he already has Premier League experience which is priceless. I think Sesko would probably cost more than Watkins too.",
      "“Why doesn’t the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop? It’s a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they’re in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.”",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has raised two concerns with Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko, but he has backed the 22-year-old to shine for the Red Devils.",

      "Including three Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders. Oh, and centre-backs. Plus defensive midfielders.",
      "10) Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nManchester United need to sell Sancho and he certainly is an available winger. Juventus have been linked with a while but it’s all very quiet regarding the ex-Borussia Dortmund man’s future.",
      "",
      "9) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who dropped out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona.",
      "Antony impressed during a productive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of last season. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "8) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nWe are three for three for United players on the chopping block. Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season and comes with baggage. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "7) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight in January?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they don’t sign Alexander Isak.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",

      "Man Utd have agreed a deal to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko ahead of rivals Newcastle; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Thursday 7 August 2025 16:00, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest ended after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Manchester United are now close to signing the Slovenian forward, having beaten Newcastle to his signature.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who look set to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko; Newcastle's new offer is £69.7m as a fixed fee plus add-ons;  Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko",
      "Tuesday 5 August 2025 13:39, UK",
      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",
      "Marcel Schafer, Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe said Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit by Isak's desire to leave but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back, although the Brentford striker wants to join the Magpies.",
      "With Callum Wilson joining West Ham, it leaves just Will Osula as their alternative to Alexander Isak at No 9.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best, so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change until the window shuts.\"",

      "Manchester United and Everton played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Atlanta as Ruben Amorim’s side won the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
