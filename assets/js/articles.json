      "Manchester United are getting ready to return to action following the final international break of 2025. The Red Devils host Everton on Monday night, aiming to build on the mini-revival that has eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Following back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Brighton, United were slightly frustrated with draws away to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. However, following such a troubled start to the season, there are signs that Amorim’s expensive squad is beginning to gel.",
      "Amorim has been left pleasantly surprised by one of his summer signings. The goalkeeper position has been a problem area for United since the departure of David de Gea, with his replacement, Andre Onana, making a string of costly blunders.",
      "Altay Bayındır was given a chance at the start of the season but failed to impress, while Onana was shipped off to Trabzonspor on loan and looks unlikely to play for the club again.",
      "As a result, United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. While it is still early days, the 23-year-old has impressed with some assured performances. Amorim has been delighted to see Lammens look so confident so early in his United career.",
      "He told Stadium Astro: “Of course, we do our diligence when we are going to buy players.",
      "“It was a surprise. All the pressure that we suffer with the goalkeeper position, to arrive here and to show that confidence. To transmit that confidence to the team, I think, was a little bit of a surprise for me.",
      "“I’m not going to say everyone, but I’m talking as a manager. I have no problem to say that was a surprise for me.”",
      "Club legend Bryan Robson wants to see United strengthen their midfield with another player like Casemiro. Having mainly signed attack players in the summer, the middle of the pitch will be an area of focus for Amorim ahead of the January window.",
      "Former Real Madrid star Casemiro, 33, has come in for criticism in recent seasons amid claims that the Brazilian is past his best. But Robson says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves and would like to see another player of his ilk arrive this winter.",
      "Robson told Sportsboom: “People say he’s not this or he’s not that, his legs have gone. Not for me, Casemiro is still a fantastic player, and he would be on my team sheet every time. I think we’d benefit from another Casemiro-like midfielder, that would definitely help us.”",
      "Robson also believes Kobbie Mainoo could still have a future at the club, despite his lack of game time under Amorim. The former Middlesbrough boss added: “I think the future is bright, the club has some great young players.",
      "“I still think there’s a lot more to come from some of these young players, just look at Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“He had so many injuries last year, it really was a stop-start season for him, but you look at the year before and he was outstanding for the last six months of the season. There’s a lot more to come from Mainoo and the other young lads.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has finally made his eagerly-anticipated debut for Monaco, though he was thrust into a nightmare situation with his team trailing 4-0. Pogba hadn't featured in competitive action for two years following a four-year doping suspension that was subsequently cut to 18 months on appeal.",
      "Following 811 days on the sidelines, Pogba can once again consider himself an active player after a brief yet undoubtedly fulfilling 10-minute appearance on Saturday night. Sadly, Monaco were being demolished 4-0 by Rennes when Pogba entered the fray.",
      "Former Arsenal forward Mika Biereth pulled one back deep into stoppage time but strikes from Abdelhamid Ait Boudlal, Mahdi Camara, Breel Embolo and Ludovic Bias had placed Rennes firmly in the driving seat.",
      "Regarding Pogba's performance, he registered 17 touches and completed 14 passes from 15 attempts. In defensive terms, he recorded two ball recoveries and one interception.",
      "The world champion has now revealed his emotions on playing again after being absent for more than two years due to his suspension and subsequent fitness issues.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, as reported by RMC Sport, Pogba said: \"I was disappointed to lose this match. It's Paul Pogba's return, but I play for Monaco, and I don't like losing. I was really happy on one hand, but on the other, I was disappointed with the result and what we did on the pitch.",
      "\"It touched me, the reception. Seeing the crowd stand up and applaud, I wasn't expecting that. A big thank you to the fans who personally supported me.",
      "\"The feeling was good, I wanted to bring good energy, not concede a goal, enjoy myself, it's been a long time. I'm relieved to be back playing football, what I love most in the world. There's still work to do to get back to full fitness.\"",
      "Monaco boss Sebastien Pocognoli had teased a potential comeback for Pogba during his pre-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"We have a session today [Friday] so we'll see. If it goes well, he can be there. He has had a run of sessions, and the feedback is positive. He has been able to test himself in match conditions. There are good signs.\"",
      "It wouldn't have been the comeback to football Pogba would have probably been envisioning, but simply being back playing the game he adores will have almost certainly felt like a monumentally important milestone.",
      "Pogba will now be hoping to step up his involvement over the forthcoming weeks and also feature in the Champions League for the first time in more than three-and-a-half years.",
      "Monaco face Cypriot outfit Pafos next Tuesday as they aim to build upon the five points already secured from four fixtures. Pogba's team then take on defending Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain that weekend.",
      "After signing for the French side as a free agent in June 2025, Pogba was given a tailored training plan to get him match fit. His return was expected against Paris FC earlier this month, but a minor injury put his comeback on hold.",

      "Scott Minto believes that Liverpool should avoid signing Antoine Semenyo in the January transfer window and go all-in for Marc Guehi. Arne Slot has struggled to find his stride in the Premier League this season, with the heart of Liverpool's defence proving particularly problematic.",
      "The side have shipped 20 goals thus far, with their previously impenetrable defence of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate looking far weaker in 2025/26 for one reason or another. Elsewhere, summer signing Milos Kerkez has suffered teething problems since his £40million switch from Bournemouth this summer, while Jeremie Frimpong has been plagued by hamstring injury.",
      "As a result of the latter's issues, the Reds have been forced to utilise the likes of Dominik Szoboszlai as a makeshift right-back to compensate. The club have also been hampered by an inability to create and put away chances this term, despite major acquisitions in the form of Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak.",
      "And while some may be quick to point the finger of blame at Slot's strike force as the catalyst of their qualms this term, others have highlighted how the back line may need further investment when the transfer window re-opens. Speaking on talkSPORT this week, Sam Matterface asked Minto and Alex Crook why they would be tempted to splurge on Crystal Palace skipper Guehi in January, given he will be available as a free agent in the summer.",
      "To which, Minto replied: \"Because questions are being asked now. Are they even going to finish in the top four? But lets see, he’s not just a short-term fix, he’s an £80million footballer.",
      "\"He's an £80million pound footballer that they could have got for £35million but for things going on elsewhere, and if they had put down £40m, £45m they probably would have got him straight away. And yet what do we think the problems are with Liverpool right now?\"",
      "Crook then added: \"I don't think Liverpool are in any kind of financial situation because they went for a couple of transfer windows didn't they? Didn't spend anything, and actually you look at their net spend which is what I was talking about…Their net spend in this summer transfer window was £218million pound less than Arsenal so I think they have got the funds.\"",
      "To which, Minto explained: \"So I would I would bring in Marc Guehi rather than Antoine Semenyo,\" before Crook asked: \"Because Van Dijk and Konate have been vulnerable?” The former Chelsea and West Ham star then replied: \"Absolutely.\"",
      "Liverpool chased Guehi's signature this summer in a deal which very nearly looked like going through until the eleventh hour. While Liverpool looked to have snagged a deadline day transfer for the England international to the tune of £35m, Palace eventually blocked the move as a result of struggling to find a replacement in time.",
      "Should Liverpool ditch their endeavours of signing Semenyo in favour of trying to strike a deal for Guehi, it would be fantastic news for Manchester United fans. The Red Devils were also linked with the Ghanaian over the course of the summer, before he ultimately committed his future to the Cherries in a new deal which should keep him at the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "However, it was recently reported that Bournemouth may be powerless in fending off interest from potential suitors in January, given Semenyo's contract is said to hold a £65m release clause which can be activated by any club. While United bolstered their attacking line with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer, they could still seek further firepower as they look to qualify for European football for 2026/27.",
      "And given Semenyo's impressive haul of six goals from 11 games this season, they may opt to pick up where they left off in tailing the 25-year-old this summer when the January transfer window blows open.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jadon Sancho has been told to halve his £300,000-a-week wages if he wants to return to Borussia Dortmund. The German outfit are keen on re-signing Sancho for a third time next summer.",
      "Sancho is desperate to find a club which can help him revive his career, and knows his best spells have been at Dortmund. But Dortmund bosses have made it clear his current contract is not affordable to them.",
      "Gregor Kobel is currently Dortmund's highest paid star, on £150,000-a-week. And Sancho would have to fall into line with the club's wage structure, in order to seal a move back to the Bundesliga outfit.",
      "Sancho has seen his career turn into a nightmare since joining Manchester United from Dortmund in 2021. The winger failed to make an impact and ended up returning to Dortmund on-loan in 2024, following a public bust up with then United boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "While back at Dortmund, he helped them reach the Champions League final. Sancho spent last season on-loan at Chelsea, who refused the option of making the move permanent last summer.",
      "Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, but has struggled for game time and made just four league appearances. He knows he needs to leave English football behind once again next summer, but it remains to be seen if he is willing to reduce his wage demands.",
      "Sancho can leave United on a free transfer in June when his contract expires, and will be able to negotiate signing on fee with a new club. He can start talking to interested clubs in January.",
      "The winger had a successful four-year stint with Dortmund between 2017 and 2021, netting 50 goals and providing 64 assists in 137 games. It was by far the best period of his career, which was derailed by his £73million transfer to United in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has managed just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, where he fell out with Erik ten Hag and was exiled by Ruben Amorim. Things haven't started well for him at Villa, either, with minutes hard to come by under Unai Emery.",
      "The Villa boss even embarrassed him by substituted Sancho on and off against Manchester City in the Premier League last month. The winger faced the ignominy of entering the field in the 29th minute and being replaced by Evann Guessand after 74 minutes against Pep Guardiola's men.",
      "“I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now, he’s not ready to play 90 minutes,\" said Emery. \"45 minutes is not easy enough for him, and I am happy and, of course, progressively, he’s getting better and better.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has turned to the club's youth system for answers, as several Manchester United stars prepare to jet off for the Africa Cup of Nations. AFCON gets underway on December 21 and continues until January 18.",
      "Numerous high-profile Premier League stars will be departing their clubs to represent their countries as a result. For Amorim, this could mean losing the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui - all crucial players - for potentially a full month.",
      "He said: \"It is a circumstance that we already knew, but it is an opportunity for other players. We also have the Under-21s and we need to also send a message in that time, so we will see. But of course, it is not ideal because they [Amad, Mazraoui and Mbeumo] are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad. But our Academy is for this moment, and we will be ready.\"",
      "At the tender age of 18, Lacey has already demonstrated his football prowess both for United's academy teams and on the international stage. He has donned the England jersey at U15, U16, U17 and most recently U20 level.",
      "For United, he made his U18 debut at a mere 15 years old and now regularly graces the pitch for the U21s. In terms of stepping into a £71million Mbeumo's shoes, the youngster offers speed and flair down the right wing.",
      "Lacey also has the ability to transition into an attacking midfield role, a trait that will undoubtedly delight Amorim. While he may not have Mbeumo's physicality, Lacey compensates with his nimbleness and technical skills, effortlessly breezing past defenders. He's also earned a reputation as a free-kick maestro at academy level.",
      "Mantato has been part of the United family since he was just nine years old. Now 18, he has proven his mettle in high-pressure situations, including scoring a last-gasp winner to defeat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup quarterfinals earlier this year.",
      "Born and bred in Manchester, Mantato can operate as either a forward or full-back. This adaptability fits perfectly into Amorim's strategy, which employs a back three and two offensive-minded full-backs who surge forward during counter-attacks.",
      "Much like £32.5m star Amad, Mantato is a skilled dribbler with blistering pace down the flank. These qualities, coupled with his versatility, make him a prime contender to fill the void left by Amad's temporary departure.",
      "Kamason became the first player from United's Emerging Talent Programme to secure a professional deal. Former U18 lead coach Adam Lawrence told The Athletic his position is \"predominantly as a full-back, but he likes to get forward and can affect the game higher up the pitch.\"",
      "This perfectly matches the type of full-back Amorim depends upon. Kamason possesses the ability to surge forward, skip past opponents and whip in threatening deliveries - qualities that would suit Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha perfectly.",
      "He has also demonstrated his capability to cope with the physical demands of defending whilst switching seamlessly between defensive and attacking phases, and could make the perfect replacement for a £17.6m Mazraoui.",

      "When Carragher addressed Liverpool's defensive issues during their chat, he emphasised how Arne Slot must sign a centre-back in January. That gave Neville the chance to ask whether failing to do so would allow United to finish above their fierce rivals come the end of the campaign, with Carra less than impressed with the cheeky dig.",
      "He responded: \"I don't think so,\" before turning the ribbing back on Neville. He continued: \"You're desperate for that aren't you? He got ridiculed, didn't he, for his predictions? So, I'm well aware every week he's on the phone to people at Sky saying, 'Well, what did Cara say in the predictions? What what did they say?'\"",
      "Neville then dismissed Carragher's joke, responding: \"Well, my predictions, as we've established in the first day, Monday Night Football are more accurate than yours over time. But I actually think this season you're in a bit of trouble.\"",
      "In a lighthearted exchange, Carragher quipped: \"I'm going to lose my job or something because I got my predictions wrong?\" as the panel erupted in laughter. When Ian Wright asked what the pair were discussing, Neville explained: \"Well, he had Liverpool winning the league.",
      "\"I had United in the top four, didn't I? They could sneak into fifth. Do you reckon they could finish fifth? Get into the Champions League.\"",

      "However, VisitAltrincham announced that the player would no longer be attending due to 'medical reasons.' The organisation posted on Instagram: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\"",

Maguire also had to be substituted during the same match due to a hamstring problem, with Amorim confessing that he \"is not ready\" for the upcoming game.",

      "Despite not getting a call-up for his country, Martinez did join up with Argentina to train and continue his journey to full fitness during the break. Speaking about the chance of him playing on Monday evening, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing,\" - a comment that will surely delight United fans across the globe.",

      "Adeyemi, 23, is under contract until 2027, but talks with Dortmund over a new deal have stalled, and he is willing to find a new club in the summer.",
      "Earlier this week, the forward issued a public apology after he was charged and fined €450,000 due to being in possession of two illegal weapons - a knuckleduster and a taser.",
      "He issued a public statement on his Instagram to address the situation: \"You have probably seen the headlines about me in the last few days. It is not easy for me to talk about this. At the beginning of 2024, out of carelessness and without really thinking about what I was doing, I ordered a so-called ‘mystery box’ on the internet.",
      "\"It contained items that are not permitted under weapons legislation. Many months later, the package was delivered and ended up unopened at the police station.",
      "\"Nevertheless, it was a huge mistake. One that I am very sorry about, that cost me dearly and that I deeply regret. I know that I am in the public eye and have a role model function. I did not live up to that.",
      "\"That is precisely why it hurts me all the more that I acted so recklessly. I have learned more from this than I can put into words. And I promise you that I will avoid such mistakes in the future. Thank you to everyone who still trusts and supports me.\"",
      "Dortmund manager Niko Kovac confirmed the player will receive no additional punishment from the club and would not stop him from being named in forthcoming squads. “It is no reason for me to ban him for the next few weeks,\" Kovac explained.",
      "\"I am not his father, but his coach. People should put things into proper perspective. Everything has now been said about it. The focus is clearly on the Bundesliga. He will get our full support for that.”",

      "The Red Devils will be the last of the teams to play across the Premier League this weekend as they welcome Everton to Old Trafford. The team have been given an extended break following the international set of fixtures, maximising their preparation time.",
      "But whilst the 8pm kick-off on Monday offers some advantages Amorim would always rather be in action at the weekend, largely so that it makes life easier for fans. He claimed that matches were \"a family moment\", but the late kick-off on Monday may hamper some fans.",
      "He told the club's website: \"You want to play at the weekend because of our fans. That is the main thing. I understand nowadays this is a business and we need to respect that also – the TV companies give us a lot of money to control that but I prefer to play at weekends because it’s a family moment. Old Trafford is always full, so it’s going to be a very good moment.”",
      "There is a feel good factor at the club, the like of which hasn't been seen during the Amorim era. But the Portuguese boss is in the midst of his best unbeaten run since being appointed with United winning three and drawing two of their past five matches. That has got the fans feeling optimistic, which has made playing at Old Trafford easier.",
      "Amorim claimed: \"In the recent past it was hard to play at home. But nowadays you miss playing at home, that is a feeling we should have in our club. I’m really excited to be back playing at home and the players also. We need to continue winning at home.”",

The ardent Manchester United supporter was unveiled as one of the 10 participants for the latest series of the ITV jungle show, following his rise to fame through online streaming.",
      "His breakthrough into mainstream media came after a standout performance in the Sidemen charity match, leading to his Soccer Aid debut at Old Trafford - just months before being selected for I'm a Celeb alongside his good mate and rapper Aitch. Angry Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, was known for filming himself at United games, but one particular clip sparked a significant backlash.",
      "On his YouTube channel, the Baller League manager frequently shares videos of his adventures playing Sunday League football and managing his Winton Yanited team.",
      "During United's 3-0 victory over Everton in November 2023, Ginge recorded himself participating in the contentious 'Feed the Scousers' chant in the away end - a video that garnered millions of views. The chant, set to the melody of the Christmas charity single 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' by Band Aid in 1984, makes light of food poverty.",
      "Following an overwhelming negative response, Ginge, who was brought up on a council estate and raised by his mother and nan, issued a heartfelt apology on his social media platforms after discussing with his Liverpudlian friends and understanding the meaning of the chant.",
      "\"I've just seen the tweets that are going around about the chant I sang at the Everton game,\" he penned. \"I'm so sorry I sang that chant, I got caught up in the moment and didn't think about what it actually meant.",
      "\"I've been told by some of my scouse mates that it's mocking poverty, and I want to say I'm so sorry I sang it and if I offended you. I've come from that background, on a council estate and ate £1 microwave meals every night.",
      "\"I 100% sympathise with you and I'm sorry, I genuinely meant nothing by it, I just got caught up. I'm so disappointed to be honest and I understand the anger, 100% because it's wrong, I did not mean to do it at all.\"",
      "Sporting his signature red Lightning McQueen crocs, Ginge had viewers in stitches from the very first episode. In the episode, he triumphed in a challenge to secure a place in the 'luxury getaway car' alongside Aitch, Eddie Kadi and Jack Osbourne.",
      "The victorious foursome were treated to steak for dinner and luxury beds upon their arrival in camp. Ginge has been put forward for the very first bushtucker trial, with both he and Ruby Wax participating in the first eating challenge at 'The Divey' in an attempt to win meals for camp. If he is chosen to undertake a second consecutive trial, he will then be exempt from the next one due to a new rule introduced for this year's show.",
      "Angry Ginge is capturing the hearts of a new generation during his stint in I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, and his latest confession about being sober has even more people praising him.",
      "In the comments, someone wrote: \"I loved seeing the conversation around sobriety (as someone is over two years in) and how they were all so honest and open about it. Hopefully it makes a difference to someone younger than me!\"",
      "Another gushed: \"Angry Ginge is HUGE for the younger male demographic. He’s a fantastic role model and on a program that’s extremely popular. Both my daughters are in relationships with boys (18 & 20), and they are far too cool to watch this usually. However, both are LOCKED IN to watch Angry Ginge and defo agree with what you say\".",
      "And a third said: \"He's absolutely brilliant. My 14-year-old boy absolutely loves him. And has actually been watching I'm a Celeb with me. He barely comes out of his room normally. Ginge is an absolute sweetheart, so is Aitch, two great role models for young men and teenage boys\".",

Rashford has rediscovered his best form and has started the last 10 matches in all competitions for his club, but that run will now come to an end.",

      "Manchester United opted to go after Benjamin Sesko ahead of Viktor Gyokeres in the summer after a data-led approach suggested the Slovenian would be better suited to them.",
      "The Red Devils were always going to add more firepower in the summer and were linked with several strikers. Ruben Amorim's history with Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Lisbon, where he was prolific, led to inevitable links but the Swede headed to Arsenal.",
      "United landed Sesko for £74million, following a transfer battle with Newcastle, and his running metres proved crucial in that decision, reports The Times. It is an area of growth the club are targeting and that approach is led by the summer recruit Mike Sansoni who joined the club as director of data after spending 11 years with the Mercedes Formula 1 team.",
      "Sansoni works closely with Wilcox and is leading a push at United which will see them become a “fully data-driven club which will lead to success on and off the pitch”. He has access to data models capable of listing the data of tens of thousands of players.",
      "The cub believe they are among the leaders in that field, which ultimately led to the signing of Sesko. The jury is still out on the ex-RB Leipzig frontman but those concerns are not shared by those in Manchester.",
      "He has only scored twice for the club. Gyokeres has copped similar criticism after a slow start that has seen him scored four times. But Amorim and co are satisfied with his movement off the ball and his attitude during the week is that of a player determined to make his mark.",
      "Sesko, as well as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, all showed a willingness to join the Manchester outfit, which was seen as another big plus. Sesko could've headed to St James' Park with Newcastle also keen on Mbeumo, who had another offer from Tottenham.",
      "Amorim accepts that Sesko will be concerned with his form, but he's confident in the striker. He said: \"I'm relaxed, he's not relaxed. I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle. That is normal. He has no experience here.\"",

      "Manchester United legends Gordon Strachan and Wes Brown remain convinced the club made the correct decision in allowing Marcus Rashford to leave despite his impressive form at Barcelona. Some supporters might understandably feel a pang of regret after watching the forward flourish in Catalonia.",
      "The 28-year-old has contributed to 15 goals in his opening 16 appearances for Barca, reminding the Old Trafford faithful of his capabilities. Furthermore, the reported £28million permanent transfer fee the Blaugrana would need to pay is looking like increasingly excellent value on their part.",
      "However, while certain United supporters may sense they're losing out, both Strachan and Brown maintain the club acted wisely in sanctioning the loan move. The duo pointed to Rashford's recent displays for Thomas Tuchel's England as additional evidence supporting their stance.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford was very good for England last week, but I maintain that Manchester United were right to part way with him,\" Strachan told Esports News. \"The time was right for both parties to move on, and it's been proven to have been the right decision.",
      "\"Rashford was struggling at United, and it seemed as if he didn't have Ruben Amorim's full confidence; he wasn't getting a lot of game time, but in the minutes that he did play, I think it's fair to say he didn't prove the doubters wrong.",
      "\"I'm glad to see him finding success at Barcelona. Everyone has said all along that he's a talented player - that's never been in doubt. The move has benefitted his career and also allowed United to move forward, rather than be stuck with a dilemma in the dressing room.\"",
      "Rashford spent the latter half of last campaign on loan at Aston Villa, where he rediscovered his spark after struggling under United manager Amorim. Before that, the club took disciplinary action against him in January 2024 following his absence from training after a night out drinking in Belfast.",
      "A fresh start seems to have done wonders for Rashford, who now resembles the player United once envisaged he'd become. And Brown reckons both sides can feel satisfied with how matters have unfolded.",
      "Speaking to BetWright casino, he said: \"Marcus Rashford was always going to do well after moving away from Manchester United. He'd been at the club for so many years and not all those years would have been enjoyable for Marcus, particularly the final couple.",
      "\"He got a lot of stick from people towards the end of last season, so I don't blame him for making a change, and I think his departure suited United as well. No one thought that he was going to leave and be shocking, but he just wasn't in the right headspace to perform at United – it wasn't working.\"",
      "The Treble-winning defender has thrown his weight behind Rashford, predicting he'll have \"a great World Cup\" next year. After England topped their group with a flawless record, Rashford ended the campaign by setting up Harry Kane in a 2-0 victory over Albania.",

      "Ex-Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood has been praised by French journalists following his stellar display for Marseille against Nice in Ligue 1. Greenwood netted twice in a 5-1 victory on Friday evening.",
      "His goals take his tally to nine and 10 league strikes respectively this campaign - putting him at the summit of the Ligue 1 Golden Boot standings. Ahead of the game he also took part in a rare interview.",
      "La Parisien led with the headline: \"Thanks to a brace from Greenwood, the Olympians sink the Aiglons and take over as leaders\" whilst heaping acclaim on the 24-year-old.",
      "They wrote: \"The Englishman then scored Marseille's second goal himself with a right-footed shot deflected by Bard, who endured a very difficult first 45 minutes.\"",
      "The publication continued: \"The Dutch goalkeeper thwarted Terem Moffi, allowing Greenwood to finally seal the victory... the Englishman was ruthless: in the 53rd minute, he left Juma Bah for dead with a feint and a burst of speed before beating Yehvann Diouf with a perfectly placed, low, right-footed shot across goal (3-0).\"",
      "Elsewhere, GET Football awarded Greenwood an eight out of 10 in their match ratings. They said: \"The Englishman provided a brace to become top scorer in the league with ten strikes.",
      "\"Whilst he had a quiet opening period, the former Manchester United man sprung into life when he found several pockets of space down the right side – especially on the counter attack.\"",
      "They added: \"His first goal was a deflected strike off Vanhoutte, but he was well-positioned to receive the ball and drive into the dangerous area on the left side. His second strike of the evening was more impressive: Leo Balerdi released him on the edge of the box, and Greenwood shifted his body well before releasing a low strike past Diouf.\"",
      "Greenwood gave an interview before the match against Nice. Quizzed about his abilities and pressed on what he considers his finest move on the pitch, Greenwood responded: \"The stepover.\"",
      "Brazilian legend Ronaldo was then brought up by the interviewer, with Greenwood revealing: \"I watched a lot of him when I was younger, he used to do it on the goalkeepers a lot, which is kind of crazy.\"",
      "In another section of the conversation, Greenwood revealed a method he employs to remain composed when facing scoring chances.",
      "\"The night before a game, I'm in bed and you're just visualising things in your head, moments on the pitch,\" he said. \"And when I go out to warm up on the pitch, I like to visualise, maybe if I'm in certain situations I'll do this or do that, so when it comes to it it's second nature really, I can just do it straight away.\"",
      "Discussing his ability to use either foot, Greenwood explained: \"When you've got both feet, the defender sometimes likes to show you one way on to your weaker side or on to another side.",
      "\"Which I like, because if he's showing me or wants to push me, I'll take the opportunity because I can shoot on the right side. Or if he wants to show me to the left, I can take the opportunity on the left.\"",
      "Since his move from United in the summer of 2024, Greenwood has been a standout performer for the French outfit. The Red Devils pocketed a cool £26.7million from the transfer, and cleverly included a sell-on clause that entitles them to half of any future fee Marseille receive for the player.",

      "The England forward initially took up residence in the luxurious Hotel Torre Melina following his temporary move to Spain from Manchester United over the summer. The hotel's prime location proved ideal for the 28-year-old given it's only a mile away from Camp Nou, where Rashford will play for the first time this weekend.",
      "However, after four months, Rashford has traded the opulent 391-room hotel for an apartment in Esplugues, a municipality on the outskirts of Barcelona nestled against the Collserola mountains.",
      "Esplugues, once home to Barcelona greats like Iniesta and Pique, will now be Rashford's base at least until next summer when his season-long loan expires. The Manchester-born striker seems to have settled well into his new surroundings, taking up local activities such as padel and fishing.",
      "While at the hotel, Rashford had access to top-notch facilities including a spa sanctuary and a fully-equipped fitness centre. The hotel also offered the privacy that Rashford, given his global fame, would undoubtedly appreciate, complete with a private helipad for air travel.",
      "In his new neighbourhood, he could potentially be joined by Barcelona team-mate Lamine Yamal. Spanish sources suggest that the young footballer had been eyeing up the mansion previously owned by Pique and his ex-wife Shakira.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reportedly raking in a whopping £325,000 per week after signing his new long-term contract this past summer, Yamal was said to be considering snapping up the property valued at £9.5million.",
      "Originally on the market for £12m three years ago, the price of the mansion has since been slashed. The sprawling 3,800 square foot estate boasts three separate houses, with the main residence featuring a tennis court and both an indoor and outdoor swimming pool.",
      "Just a few months into his Barcelona stint and Rashford is already making waves in Spain. Currently ranking as the fifth-most prolific player in Europe this season in terms of goal involvements, he's already netted six goals and provided nine assists in just 16 matches.",

      "Rashford's modest approach away from football is drawing comparisons with Barca sensation Lamine Yamal, who has been in the spotlight over his off-field conduct.",
      "The England international has netted six goals and provided nine assists since his summer switch to the Catalan club. Following his move to Spain, the striker has refocused his priorities, delivering a string of eye-catching displays.",
      "Away from the spotlight, Rashford is understood to have left the centrally-located Hotel Torre Melina, situated a mile from the stadium. He's now settled into a flat in Esplugues, nestled beside the Collserola mountains.",
      "Sources indicate he enjoys playing padel and fishing during his downtime. One of the forward's preferred dining spots is reportedly La Cupula Garraf, a restaurant boasting spectacular coastal views.",
      "Diario Sport said: \"The feedback in the media on Marcus has been positive. Zero off-field issues, nothing about his life outside of Barça. All of that is about Lamine.\"",
      "The same cannot be said for the 18-year-old Lamine. The Barcelona wonderkid has attracted negative attention for multiple incidents in his private life this year alone.",
      "Most significantly, Lamine encountered fierce criticism after throwing a private celebration over the summer for his birthday. The Spanish authorities were reported to have called for an inquiry into the event at the time, which featured guests with dwarfism and women in revealing outfits.",
      "Spanish publication Marca reported that Jesus Martin, the General Director of Disability in the government, urged ministers to launch an investigation.",
      "The Association of People with Achondroplasia and other Skeletal Dysplasias in Spain (ADEE) also condemned Yamal's choice to employ people with dwarfism for entertainment purposes.",
      "The Spain international has already been absent for several matches this season, yet he's still managed to net three goals and register five assists in eight appearances across all competitions. His private affairs have become somewhat of a distraction though.",
      "He has made headlines for his romance with Argentine rapper Nicki Nicole, 25, owing to the couple's notable age difference.",
      "Yamal has since confirmed that he's no longer in a relationship with the musician. However, he had also been romantically connected with a 30-year-old influencer, before his relationship with Nicole.",
      "Rashford, meanwhile, appears to be embracing his new life. Speaking to ESPN on if he wanted to stay at Barcelona and make his move permanent, he said: \"Oh yeah, for sure.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it is an honour.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim still has Manchester United sticking to a relentless training schedule despite their lack of European football putting less demands on the players.",
      "No midweek European outings would open the door for additional time away from the training ground, but the Portuguese boss still has his players active six days a week. Mondays are their designated day off and on only one occasion has Amorim given his players two days off, reports The Times.",
      "It underlines his desire to get United up to speed following a poor campaign last time out. His unique system also requires extra attention as Amorim remains wedded to his philosophy, which his players must grasp.",
      "The heavy schedule also suggests the United boss wants his players tuned for the return of European football, which will be their target this season.",
      "In a normal week United's stars would have Monday off before a heavy Tuesday session. Wednesday would include more than two hours of work before Thursday's recovery session. Friday would be a shorter, tactical-based approach. Saturday is matchday and Sunday would be recovery.",
      "In an effort to get his United players fully understanding his wants Amorim has confessed to physically walking them into positions, rather than sitting through loads of video footage. He said: \"I was a football player. Videos more than 12 minutes? Forget! Because they lose concentration. Instead of video, we do it like walking – and jogging – it’s a way to do it. Showing some video.\"",
      "Almost all of United's rivals are playing European football of some form this season. Chelsea, Newcastle, Tottenham, Aston Villa and Liverpool are all in midweek action, adding to their schedules, whilst the Red Devils are getting the additional rest.",
      "That could prove to their advantage later in the season. United missed out on the chance to play in the Champions League when they lost the Europa League final to Tottenham last season - but Amorim claims believes they were not equipped to feature at Europe's top table.",
      "“I think we were not prepared to play Europe,” he said earlier this season. “That is my feeling; to have strong games in the Champions League and to play Premier League we need time to develop as a team.",

      "Sadio Mane has recalled how Jurgen Klopp persuaded him to reject Manchester United for Liverpool. The Senegalese forward won every major honour during his time with the Reds as he established himself as an Anfield legend with 120 goals and 38 assists from 269 appearances after arriving from Southampton in 2016.",
      "At the time, Mane was wanted by Tottenham, then managed by Mauricio Pochettino, as well as Liverpool and United. He came incredibly close to joining the latter, holding extensive talks and even agreeing a deal to sign for the Red Devils.",
      "However, everything changed when Klopp, who almost signed Mane when he was in charge of Borussia Dortmund, picked up the phone. He told Rio Ferdinand’s Presents show: “Klopp called me. He apologised [that the Dortmund move didn’t materialise].",
      "“He said, ‘We will build a team no one wants to play against and you will play every game.’” United legend Ferdinand responded: “That’s the killer line, that one [about playing every game].”",
      "Mane continued: “At the time, that was the kind of project I wanted because he said we would make a strong team and I would play every game.”",
      "He wasn’t initially convinced by Klopp’s claim, pointing out he had the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino in his squad. He added: “He [Klopp] said, ‘No, you will play every game.’ I said, I don’t want to know anymore, I want to come.”",
      "Mane didn’t get the same reassurance from United’s manager at the time, Louis van Gaal. He said: “I was talking to Van Gaal. He called me. He said, ‘How are you? I want you to come to Manchester United. I know you are a good player and you can help the team.’",
      "“I said, ‘You have [Wayne] Rooney, you have [Memphis] Depay, you have [Angel] Di Maria, you have [Robin] Van Persie. Where am I going to play?’ That was my question because I want to play.",
      "“He said, ‘I know your talent. If you train good, you will play but we have other good players.’ So I was not convinced. A few days later, Klopp called me.”",
      "Mane previously told Jamie Carragher in an interview for The Telegraph: \"I was really close to going to Manchester United. I had the contract there.",
      "“I had it all agreed. It was all ready, but instead I thought, ‘No, I want to go to Liverpool.’ I was convinced to go with Klopp’s project.”",
      "Mane, 33, left Liverpool for Bayern Munich in 2022 but spent just a season with the German giants before joining Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, where Cristiano Ronaldo is one of his team-mates.",

      "David Beckham once showed his kindness with a classy gesture at one of Gordon Ramsay’s dinner parties. Beckham enjoyed one of the most legendary careers in English football, winning a host of honours with Manchester United, including the Treble in 1999.",
      "Spells at Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain followed before he finally called time on his playing career in his late 30s. Few sportspeople have reached the heights of fame and fortune that the former England captain has, given his off the field ventures. Even fewer are thought of as grounded and gentlemanly.",
      "Beckham, 50, finally received his knighthood earlier this month, having been recognised for his services to sport and charity. Following the service at Windsor Castle, where he was knighted by King Charles III, Beckham was photographed leaving his close friend Ramsay’s Michelin-starred restaurant in Chelsea.",
      "The football legend met Ramsay back in 2006, with the two celebrities’ friendship deepening after they both relocated to Los Angeles with their wives and children. According to Tash Pericic, former assistant manager to the superstar chef at his Michelin-starred Maze Grill in London, Beckham was one of the regular diners there.",
      "Ms Pericic also recalled a time when she was helping to cater for a private Christmas time dinner at Ramsay’s home in London, where another interaction with Beckham left a lasting impression.",
      "She explained in an interview with Insider that Ramsay, aside from getting irate about some chairs - \"What the f*** do you call these chairs!? They're so terrible I wouldn't throw them on a f****** bonfire! - was mainly amicable.",
      "She added: \"Gordon turned to us and said, 'Relax, you aren't at work, enjoy, have a glass of champagne,' so we had a Christmas Eve toast with Gordon.\"",
      "But Beckham’s politeness apparently stood out even more. She went on to explain how the former Manchester United star, accompanied by his wife, Victoria, was the only guest to introduce himself to the kitchen staff.",
      "\"A small gesture, but it says a lot,\" she said. Her anecdote showed an appreciation for his kindness towards staff, who are very often under tremendous pressure to deliver in the hospitality sector, despite his own fame and success.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Wout Weghorst has opened up about his stint at Old Trafford, blaming Erik ten Hag's tactics for his failure to score more goals. The 6ft 6in striker’s loan move from Burnley to United raised plenty of eyebrows in January 2023.",
      "Following a brief but fruitful loan spell with Turkish giants Besiktas, Weghorst joined compatriot Ten Hag at United as the club scrambled to replace the departed Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "The Dutchman never lacked commitment in a United shirt but managed a meagre return of just two goals from 31 outings across all competitions during his six month stay, failing to find the net in the Premier League. He did, however, lift the Carabao Cup that season and set up Marcus Rashford in the final against Newcastle.",
      "That remains the only major honour of the 33-year-old's playing career. But Weghorst has since opened up about his lack of goals, claiming he was used as a foil to get the best out of others while citing Ten Hag’s system as the reason.",
      "\"They were super successful months in which we hardly lost,\" Weghorst explained. \"I was also very important for the team as both a focal point of play and the hard-working link between midfield and attack.",
      "“Only my goals were lagging behind. That gnawed at me and was the reason why I lost my starting place. The Premier League is by far the toughest league in the world, with the best defenders. But we were rarely the dominant side creating chances. And the way we played was also different from what I was used to.",
      "“In Germany and Turkey, the teams always played for me. I was the end of the line, while at United, I mainly had to ensure that others could excel. I think I managed that very well. But whichever way you look at it, I would have liked to score much more often.”",
      "The Netherlands international, now at Ajax, revealed he turned down a lucrative proposal from Besiktas after a spell where he scored nine goals in 18 matches. The opportunity to join United when they came calling after his performances at the Qatar 2022 World Cup proved impossible to resist.",
      "“Things went very well at Besiktas and I was enjoying myself immensely there,\" the striker said. “One evening my agent Simon Cziommer called me. Simon said ‘there are two clubs interested in you. First he told me a story about Brentford - and then he suddenly shouted ‘Wout, United want you!’ I dropped the phone and burst into tears.",
      "“My relationship with Besiktas' sporting director was very good and I explained to him that it was my boyhood dream to play for Manchester United. He said he understood, but Besiktas kept coming up with more and more financial offers. I won't mention any amounts, but believe me when I say that I lost a lot to make the transfer possible.”",
      "Weghorst's passion for United was so intense that he lifted the lid on how overwhelmed he became while watching the Red Devils defeat rivals City 2-1 in the Manchester derby as his transfer was being finalised. He admitted: \"I entered that magical stadium for the first time in my life and when I sat down in my seat, looked around and took in the chanting of the fans, it hit me hard.",
      "“That was the moment when I realised this is my club now. Then I watched one of the greatest football matches on earth. Of course I had dreamed about this as a young boy. But to see it actually happen made me shiver.”",
      "He was frequently used as a lone striker under Ten Hag and the shortage of chances created for him contributed significantly to his modest goals return, leaving him with mixed feelings about his spell at Old Trafford. He said: \"There was zero adjustment time. The pressure was bizarre and the physical strain greater than I had ever experienced.",
      "“Only in the last few months did I feel I was really comfortable in it. Then I became myself and dared to throw off the shyness. In the period before that, maybe I was too humble.",
      "“But I will never forget my goal at Old Trafford against Real Betis. The fans were super crazy about me because they also saw that I was doing everything for it. I'm quite proud that I got this far.”",
      "When he left Old Trafford in the summer of 2023, Weghorst put his love for United, and thanks to their fans, on record. Alongside a video compilation of his time with United, he said: \"Dear Man United fans, thanks for everything. I really enjoyed every single second at this club, from winning silverware to scoring my first goal against Betis at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Dreams came true. Unbelievably proud to wear the badge. I wish you all the best for the future. Man United fans, thank you very much.\" The striker joined Ajax in August 2024 after another loan spell at German side Hoffenheim.",

      "“Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised,\" said Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber about Manchester United loanee Radek Vitek last month. \"He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "The general rule with United loans is that they send players with a genuine chance of contributing to the first team at Old Trafford on loan to the Championship. Vitek and Toby Collyer are currently playing in the division. Alvaro Fernandez and Amad were success stories at Preston and Sunderland respectively.",
      "The Championship is an unforgiving 46-game campaign, and young players must demonstrate resilience and quality to be successful in the division.",
      "Vitek has shown a lot of quality since he signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan. The goalkeeper has started every league game, kept five clean sheets and has won huge praise from their fans.",
      "He made the perfect first impression after signing on loan, saving a penalty in Bristol City's final pre-season game, and has not looked back.",
      "\"Of course, signing a player from Manchester United always brings with it a sense of excitement, but the 22-year-old was certainly an unknown quantity when he arrived.",
      "\"A penalty save and clean sheet in his first, and only, friendly for the Robins against Real Valladolid impressed those in attendance, and Vitek has only improved from that point on.",
      "\"His opening day display away to Sheffield United was superb as he commanded his penalty area brilliantly and pulled off a handful of smart stops from a variety of different scenarios.",
      "\"While you would expect a young goalkeeper to potentially be a bit of a rabbit in the headlights in what is an incredibly physical Championship this season, Vitek has looked like a veteran stopper in England’s second tier.\"",
      "He continued: \"Barring one uncharacteristic error in the 5-1 defeat to Stoke City, Vitek has been brilliant. It isn’t an exaggeration to suggest he has single-handedly won points on several occasions.",
      "\"He has produced multiple match-deciding stops at crucial points of matches. Vitek has kept five clean sheets over the course of his first 15 matches in red and white, and you could argue he deserves more.",
      "\"Against the likes of Charlton, Norwich City, Birmingham City and Hull City, it was his work between the posts as much as that of the attackers at the other end of the pitch that proved to be the difference, with his showing against the Addicks in particular a real standout.",
      "\"The fans have taken to him, as displayed by his interactions with away ends. The fact that he has kept Max O’Leary out of the team - the goalkeeper who played all 46 matches last season as the Reds ended their 17-year wait for a top six finish - speaks volumes to just how impressed Struber has been so far.\"",
      "Vitek cut his teeth on loan with Accrington Stanley in the second half of 2023/24. He joined the League Two club in the winter window and made 18 starts in the league, helping to guide them to safety.",
      "When Vitek reported for pre-season at Carrington after that loan, he started in a United friendly against Rosenborg in Norway and delivered a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "He told MUTV: \"It's really good for youngsters to get the opportunity, but when you step on the field you have to show yourself because it's a big chance in front of a lot of people.\"",
      "When asked about what it was like to represent United in pre-season, Vitek smiled and added: \"It's an amazing feeling, the fans are absolutely amazing and it was a full stadium of red shirts.\"",
      "Vitek was named in the 29-man travelling squad for the United States tour, but he was sent on a season-long loan to Austrian club FC Blau-Weiß Linz after returning to Manchester.",
      "During his unveiling, FC Blau-Weiß Linz's sporting director said: \"With Radek, we are getting a very talented young goalkeeper who has already gained a lot of experience in England and is, among other things, part of the goalkeeping team of Manchester United's first team.\"",
      "Vitek started almost every league game for FC Blau-Weiß Linz, only missing three matches due to an injury. His loan was a resounding success and FC Blau-Weiß Linz wanted to re-sign him on loan this summer.",
      "Speaking in June, United academy goalkeeper coach Tommy Lee said: “Radek has done great in Austria. He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well.",
      "\"He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers. He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional.",
      "\"That is going to take him, I believe, to the top level. He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He’s 6ft 6ins, which always helps. For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Bristol City was chosen as the best destination for Vitek to take the next step in his career, and he signed a new contract with United, expiring in 2028, before moving south to Ashton Gate for this season.",
      "Carter explained: \"United fans will have likely seen the clip of the ridiculous save Radek Vitek made to deny Oli McBurnie from close range in City’s win over Hull City back in October.",
      "\"He got down well to claw a low header off the line and away from danger, a stop you wouldn’t imagine someone his size could make, and it was just one of multiple key saves in that contest.",
      "\"His intervention to deny Norwich City’s Jack Stacey at Carrow Road may have been even better, however. Stacey had peeled into space in the centre of the penalty area and wrapped his foot around a cut-back to fire a shot towards the bottom right corner.",
      "\"Despite having an obscured view, Vitek took off to his left and got down well to not only get a big hand on the bouncing shot but also push it into the path of Neto Borges, who could hack clear.",
      "\"Struber said after that win at Carrow Road that even he was surprised at times by just what Vitek was capable of. I am probably forgetting other impressive saves, but the fact that there are quite so many to pick from is a testament to just how good Vitek has been during his loan.\"",
      "Discussing Vitek's strengths and weaknesses, Carter said: \"He is a really good shot-stopper. Whether it be when reacting to close-range efforts or when dealing with looping shots from range, he seems to have the answer more often than not.",
      "\"If you were to look back at the goals he has conceded so far this season, you’d do well to suggest he could have done much better with all but a handful of them.",
      "\"When it comes to commanding his box, he uses every inch of his frame to deal well with high balls, whether that be from open play or set-pieces. It has been clear this season just how much more comfortable Bristol City have been when defending corners, and a large part of that has been their goalkeeper’s willingness to leave his line and deal with looping balls.",
      "\"It is challenging to identify a major weakness, but I think you could make a compelling argument that distribution is Vitek’s primary area for improvement.",
      "\"He can kick the ball further than most goalkeepers I’ve seen at Ashton Gate, and he has pulled off a couple of smart - if concerning - Cruyff turns, but he has probably kicked goal kicks into touch a bit too often. He is by no means terrible with the ball at his feet, but he could be a bit more polished.\"",
      "When asked whether Vitek could play in the Premier League, he added: \"Absolutely. Bristol City have signed several players on loan from Premier League clubs over the years, and although it is still early days, Radek Vitek has been one of the most impressive.",
      "\"Vitek has been one of the division’s best shot stoppers and he is excellent when it comes to commanding his box. Naturally, given his age and lack of top-flight experience, he has room to improve, but you would struggle to find a Bristol City fan who wasn’t confident that Vitek will play in the Premier League.",
      "\"Of course, it will depend on what Manchester United plan to do with him come the end of his time at Ashton Gate, but I would imagine his performances will have caught the eye of some Premier League sides.",
      "\"Whether it be at Old Trafford, another club, or hopefully, in another loan spell with the Robins after helping them win promotion this term, I’d expect Vitek to be playing top-flight football next season.\"",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing. The first game away from home... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget it.\"",
      "He went on to discuss his hopes of playing for United. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek has huge potential and could challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot next season.",

      "Manchester United are heading towards a crucial period of the season following the final international break of 2025. The festive period is often when the table starts to take shape and while the top end is congested now, it probably won't be once the festive fixtures have been played.",
      "United will hope by January they are still in the mix for the European qualification spots as a bare minimum. However, the target will be a spot in the Champions League next season and with no other distractions before January, it is a good time for the Reds to push on.",
      "What we also expect to find out by January is the future of Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman is understood to be preparing to request an exit from Old Trafford this winter and you can't blame him. After featuring for just 90 minutes over five matches, his hopes of a World Cup place are slipping away.",
      "But before Zirkzee's time at United is ended, there's a chance that he could work his way back into the plans. Benjamin Sesko will miss the clash with Everton on Monday night and that leaves Ruben Amorim with a problem.",
      "Barring the opening three matches of the season when Sesko was getting up to speed and in tough away games at Liverpool and Tottenham, Amorim has chosen the Slovenian to lead the line. The strikerless system was used as a necessity at the start of the season but has been used sparingly since.",
      "Against a team like Everton, United would ordinarily choose to go with Sesko. The strikerless system tends to have been used against teams where the Reds are expected to not have it all their own way having struggle when Sesko started at Manchester City.",
      "Therefore, if Amorim were to overlook Zirkzee and choose Mason Mount or keep Amad as the No.10, it seems pretty nailed on the Dutchman's future has been decided. Whether United allow him to leave in the January transfer window depends entirely on the boss.",
      "When he was asked in October about Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo leaving, he said: \"I understand that but they are our players and we need everyone to have a good season. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise.",
      "\"Players are not playing. They want to play, and there's a World Cup. There are agents that listen to the players, talking all the time.\" If Amorim thinks Zirkzee leaving in the middle of the season will compromise his team's chances of progressing this campaign then the striker will not go.",
      "But if Zirkzee is overlooked on Monday while Sesko is out injured it will be the biggest sign yet that Amorim's mind is made up on the Dutchman and his United career will be unlikely to extend beyond next summer.",

      "Shortly after Ruben Amorim's appointment at Manchester United last year, he was asked whether Manuel Ugarte was setting the standard in the dressing room and responded: “It is his style, he is from Uruguay, that can help. He is a good example, a lot of players are giving their best.\"",
      "Amorim worked with Ugarte at Sporting Lisbon and, naturally, favoured the midfielder in his first few months at Old Trafford, but Ugarte has gone from being an \"example\" to being on borrowed time. The bottom line is Ugarte has not been good enough during his 15 months in Manchester for a player who commanded a €50million (£42.3m) transfer fee with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons.",
      "Ugarte was expected to be a big winner from Amorim's appointment. He had played his best football under Amorim at Sporting, and the rekindling of that relationship was expected to benefit him.",
      "However, Amorim will likely be disappointed with the current version of Ugarte, as he probably doesn't recognise him from the player who excelled in Portugal's top flight. Ugarte has made just two starts in the Premier League this season. The 24-year-old has played just 346 minutes across 10 appearances (seven from the bench) in all competitions.",
      "Amorim has voted with his feet by not starting Ugarte. Casemiro's superb form has been a factor but Ugarte has been poor when he has been given a chance. Before the international break, Ugarte allowed Tottenham forward Wilson Odobert to burst towards the penalty area and Matthijs de Ligt was turned in the box by Mathys Tel.",
      "The fingers were pointed at De Ligt, but Ugarte was far too weak, allowing Odobert to breeze beyond him, despite being positioned ahead of the Spurs man when he received the ball.",
      "Ugarte could have done better for Grimsby Town's opening goal in the Carabao Cup debacle. There were multiple stages at which the goal could have been prevented, but it was concerning to see Ugarte fail to react quickly to losing possession of the ball at the beginning of the move.",
      "The midfielder collided with Amad on the halfway line. There were 11 seconds between Ugarte going to the ground and Grimsby's opening goal. He reached the penalty area as the ball left Charles Vernam's boot, suggesting he could have got closer if he had reacted immediately.",
      "Ugarte bounced back after that defeat to emerge with some credit against Manchester City in September, and he was decent against Chelsea, but most of his contributions have been disappointing.",
      "New signings should be given time before concrete judgments are made, but no excuses can be made when a player has entered their second year at United.",
      "Ugarte has been given time to settle and adapt to his surroundings. He is now held to an even higher standard. He will be aware his performances have not been good enough, and may even feel that he could be on the move at the end of the campaign if his situation does not change.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa recalled Ugarte to the Uruguay squad for the November break after overlooking him in October, but Ugarte could be overlooked again for his nation if he is not playing.",
      "The only way Ugarte can play more for United is by performing when he gets the opportunity. He was supposed to be the successor to Casemiro, but the player he was signed to replace is performing better. Casemiro is 33 and Ugarte should be able to offer more.",
      "Ugarte is on the path to be remembered among the many underwhelming United signings.",

      "Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire have been ruled out of Manchester United's game against Everton due to injury, but Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo could return to the squad.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Amorim was asked to provide an update on Sesko's injury during his press conference on Friday, and he said: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him. He is going to recover and he is feeling better.\"",
      "In terms of other team news he added: \"Maguire is not ready, Kobbie did not train today, but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie, so we’ll see. Licha is coming close to be ready to play. Of course, we need to be careful with his first minutes, but he's clearly in a better position than two weeks ago.\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. He started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season before making his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month, but he has not scored since and Amorim has said it was a \"fact\" that he has \"struggled a little bit\".",
      "Martinez returned to full training earlier in the month, but United were reluctant to rush him back into action, so he was left out the squads against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "The defender joined up with Argentina's national team during the international break. Martinez did not partake in games and a member of United’s performance team supported him.",
      "Speaking about Martinez potentially playing in midfield, Amorim said: \"I can think a smart, intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions, but it is not the position for him. In an emergency, he can play.\"",
      "Mainoo was absent against Tottenham due to a knock picked up during training, but he could be available to face Everton on Monday night. Jack Fletcher was drafted into the squad against Spurs, and his inclusion continued United's 88-year record of featuring an academy graduate in every matchday squad.",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League this season. The midfielder's only start of the campaign came against Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the Carabao Cup second round.",
      "The 20-year-old requested to leave on loan in the summer transfer window for the sake of regular minutes, but Amorim blocked the request and explained that Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Hello and welcome to our Manchester United's live blog on Saturday, November 22.",
      "With the January transfer window rapidly approaching, clubs are preparing to make moves - whether that means offloading players or bringing in reinforcements. As always, United have been linked with several names, though it remains to be seen if any deals will actually go through.",
      "One player regularly mentioned is Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo, whose release clause becomes active in the New Year. United, however, face competition from other Premier League sides.",
      "The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) could also play a role in shaping transfer plans, with players such as Amad Diallo set to be away on international duty. How United respond to these challenges will be worth keeping an eye on in the weeks ahead.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and transfer rumours involving Man Utd below.",
      "Conor Gallagher has admitted he wants a bigger role at Atletico Madrid after being linked with a move to Manchester United. United’s well known frailties in central midfield have understandably led to the club looking at potential options in the transfer market.",
      "One of the players they were linked with in the summer was the 25-year-old England international, although a move failed to materialise as Atletico were only prepared to sanction a permanent sale.",
      "Gallagher, who was sold by boyhood club Chelsea to the La Liga side in the summer of 2024 for a fee of £34million, made 50 appearances in Spain in his first season. And while he has continued to feature in every game, his minutes have been mainly limited to appearances off the bench.",
      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches. United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m).",
      "The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago. Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight. As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "Crystal Palace and Jean-Philippe Mateta have held talks over a contract extension at Selhurst Park. The France international was one of the names linked with a potential switch to Old Trafford in the summer, prior to Benjamin Sesko's £74m transfer.",
      "United, who were said to be in talks with Mateta's representatives earlier this year, recently suffered an injury blow with Sesko ruled out for several weeks. Despite the short-term nature of the Slovenian's injury, Amorim is said to be interested in bringing in an additional striker.",
      "That could see United return for the 28-year-old Mateta, who has 18 months left on his deal in south London. It was previously reported that the Eagles were looking for a bid in the region of £40m to part ways with their striker, who has scored 16 and 14 goals in each of the previous two seasons.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire have been ruled out of Manchester United's game against Everton due to injury, but Lisandro Martinez and Kobbie Mainoo could return to the squad.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury against Tottenham before the international break. He was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute in London but he lasted just half an hour.",
      "The 22-year-old was forced to withdraw from international duty with Slovenia and underwent scans at Carrington during the break, which confirmed the injury was not a major issue.",
      "Read more here",
      "Matheus Cunha has suffered an accident in Manchester United training, it is claimed.",
      "On Saturday, the Brazilian was due to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham, but in a statement on Instagram, VisitAltrincham have claimed that the player suffered an “accident” in training on Saturday, and could no longer attend for “medical reasons”.",
      "A post shared by Visit Altrincham (@visitaltrincham)",
      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko was not seen taking part in the training session held prior to the clash with Everton on Monday night. The Slovenian hobbled off the pitch against Tottenham Hotspur before the international break, leaving the Reds with just ten men for the remainder of the game.",
      "The forward went straight down the tunnel and Ruben Amorim hinted he may have to delve into the transfer market if his injury is a long-term issue. Whether that is the case or not remains to be seen but Sesko was not seen taking part in training on Friday morning. Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo were also not seen in the training session.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United do not meet a traditional big-six side across their next 10 Premier League matches in a huge boost to Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Reds will be feeling much better about themselves after a poor start to the campaign - which had seen head coach Amorim come under increasing pressure. United are currently on a five-match unbeaten run, though, and sit seventh in the top-flight table after 11 games.",
      "Amorim's squad have secured wins over in-form Sunderland, reigning Premier League champions Liverpool and a Brighton side who have caused them major problems in recent seasons. Amorim's men have earned draws in their last two fixtures - at Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have been told they won't be signing Elliot Anderson this winter - but Conor Gallagher could still be an option.",
      "Alex Crook told talkSPORT: “It’s not going to happen in January. I’d be surprised if United do much in January, maybe Conor Gallagher on loan, if he’s available, is a possibility. And Conor, to try and force his way back into the England squad might be up for that.",
      "“It’s a big jump, isn’t it, for Elliot Anderson? Bearing in mind they paid [Newcastle United] £35m for him. Is he a £100m player? I think he’s a really good player, not sure he’s quite worth that much.”",
      "Manchester United are scouting two players from the same club who attracted interest from Arsenal over the summer.",
      "French journalist Francois Rausy reported, via TeamTalk, that during a Rennes game he spoke to United scout Steve Head, who confirmed he was there to watch Jeremy Jacquet and Mohamed Kadar Meite.",
      "Arsenal were heavily linked with Jacquet during the summer window but ultimately Mikel Arteta’s side opted to sign Cristhian Mosquera instead.",
      "Barcelona have released a statement regarding Marcus Rashford's absence from their match againt Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The statement read: \"Marcus Rashford will miss today’s match against Athletic Club due to flu\".",
      "This alleivates any concern that the Manchester United loanee had suffered an injury as this would have impacted Barca's efforts to permanently sign Rashford.",
      "Marc-Andre Ter Stegen's challenging situation at Barcelona has been closely watched by clubs, including United.",
      "According to Spanish outlet El Desmarque, Ter Stegen's plan is to leave Barcelona in search of regular game-time ahead of the World Cup next summer.",
      "United are claimed to have already made an offer alongside Besiktas ahead of January's window However, it's also said that Besiktas bid is \"much more firm\", but a decision will reputedly only be made once he returns to full fitness.",
      "Manchester United have identified their latest midfield transfer target as Ruben Amorim continues to build his squad.",
      "19-year-old Victor Froholdt is on United's radar, according to The Peoples Person. The Danish international has scored twice and bagged three assists in 16 appearances for FC Porto.",
      "Real Madrid are reported to have an interest in the young midfielder too. Froholdt has a release clause worth around £75m which could prove an obstacle for United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has pointed to the club's academy for solutions when a series of Manchester United players depart for AFCON.",
      "AFCON could see the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui - all key players - out for potentially an entire month. The United boss is reportedly trying to keep them at the club for as long as possible before the tournament begins.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "Karim Adeyemi would prefer to play for Liverpool and Real Madrid despite Manchester United being in talks to bring the 23-year-old to Old Trafford.",
      "This is according to Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung who also add that Adeyemi will not extend his current deal with Borrusia Dortmund. This would see the winger's contract expire in 2027.",
      "There are no reports of Liverpool and Madrid holding a transfer interest in Adeyemi.",
      "Out-on-loan goalkeeper Andre Onana is reportedly eager to revive his United career once he returns to the club from Trabzonspor.",
      "The 29-year-old is spending the campaign in Turkey after losing his No.1 position at Old Trafford following a series of high-profile errors last year.",
      "According to The i Paper, the Cameroon international still hopes to reclaim the gloves upon the conclusion of his loan spell. However, sources close to Onana suggest that a transfer to another Premier League team has not been ruled out, either.",
      "Spanish outlet El Desmarque report that Manchester United have made an offer to sign Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen in January.",
      "According to the report, both United and Besiktas have submitted bids for the Germany international, whose future at Barca remains uncertain.",
      "United brought in Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp during the summer, while Andre Onana is currently out on loan at Trabzonspor.",
      "McTominay, who left Man United for Napoli in 2024, has thrived in Serie A and is now attracting interest from Premier League clubs.",
      "TEAMtalk report Tottenham, Arsenal, Everton and United are keeping tabs on the midfielder.",
      "Man United have a difficult challenge in their pursuit of Semenyo.",
      "talkSPORT report that Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal are all interested in the Bournemouth winger.",
      "The Manchester United boss has revealed that the club will speak with national federations in an effort to delay the release of certain players.",
      "Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui are all due to join up with their countries for the Africa Cup of Nations next month.",
      "\"We have the rules for when we have to release the players [but] we are trying to have the players a bit longer,\" the Portuguese said.",
      "\"It is not just in our hands. We will see. We will try to arrange something with the federations.\"",
      "Mali international Cedric Kante has suggested it's only a matter of time until Baleba leaves Brighton amid interest from Man United.",
      "\"Manchester United have been interested in him for some time now, especially during the last summer transfer window,\" Kante told Africa Foot.",
      "\"It doesn’t really surprise me, as the club has the resources to sign him and offer him a very high salary. In my opinion, yes, Baleba will sign with a big English club soon. It seems a done deal.",
      "\"Now, the question is when the Cameroonian will leave Brighton. If a club comes in with an offer of over €100 million, his management will find it hard to refuse. And whoever signs him will be getting a good deal: he’s a reliable, consistent player they can count on.\"",
      "The Times report that Forest could seek £100m, just a year after paying £35m for the midfielder.",
      "Anderson, who joined Forest from Newcastle last summer, has thrived at the City Ground, attracting interest from Manchester City, Chelsea and a potential return to his former club.",
      "\"It is nothing to do with me, it is the powers that be,\" Forest boss Sean Dyche said when quizzed on whether he is braced for any January bids for Anderson.",
      "\"They run the club and the financial side. I’m sure they will ask my opinion about the situation, if it is needed - not just about him but about all the players here.\"",
      "He added: \"He is a good player. He has got everything in front of him. I have spoken to him about what I call the nuts and bolts of his performances. But I remember we had a similar thing with Jarrad Branthwaite and people used to talk to me about coaching him. I would say that he didn’t need it at that moment. Less is more for him (Anderson), I think.",
      "\"He is naturally going about his business the right way and is learning the game as he goes. You have got to be careful not to over-coach someone. I don’t think he needs that at the moment.",
      "\"We are allowing him to go and play and are just giving him some guidance and some pointers, that’s it really. I am enjoying what he is about and am enjoying his performances. He has got a bit of an edge to him in training when I quiz him about moaning all the time. I have a laugh with him about that. He is a very good player and is a good person as well. I like that mixture.\"",
      "Man United are reportedly looking to release Sancho at the end of the season.",
      "The Sun understand that selling both Sancho and Casemiro would save more than £31m a year in wages. Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, having made four appearances so far.",
      "Elsewhere, United are set to receive £38m from Napoli for Rasmus Hojlund while Barcelona have the option to buy Marcus Rashford for £30m.",
      "According to The Sun, Man United will not trigger the one-year extension in Casemiro's contract.",
      "The Brazilian, who earns a reported £300,000-a-week, is in the final year of his deal.",
      "Man United are reportedly 'prepared' to offload captain Bruno Fernandes to help fund for other transfers next summer.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, selling the Portugal midfielder could help fund moves for Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba.",
      "However, this won't come cheap with Wharton valued at around £70million, while Anderson could cost £80m and Baleba in excess of £100m.",
      "The Premier League is back this afternoon but Ruben Amorim's side will not be in action until Monday, facing Everton at home."

      "Nobody would have believed this statement at the start of the season, but Luke Shaw can be classed as one of the best players of the season so for Manchester United. Ignoring the Manchester City defeat, where nobody covered themselves in glory, Shaw has been a dependable option for Ruben Amorim.",
      "His reliability has been missing in recent years. In the 2024/25 season, he missed 294 days due to three injuries. The season prior it was 239 days and there were question marks over whether he would stay fit long enough to contribute to the cause.",
      "And yet, his redemption arc has been spectacular in the 2025/26 campaign. He has started every single Premier League fixture for Amorim and is settled on the left of the back three in Lisandro Martinez's absence.",
      "None of this could have been expected at the end of last season but it is a credit to the medical team and Shaw that he has managed to become a regular again. However, this could all unravel if Amorim goes with the idea he floated in his pre-Everton press conference when asked whether Shaw could play at left wing-back.",
      "\"He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.\" In a way, you can see why Amorim would come to that conclusion.",
      "Naturally, Shaw is a full-back but he has suffered a lot of injuries since last playing on the flank. He has had to adapt his style of play and is impressing in the less physically demanding role of left centre-back.",
      "Amorim said it himself in his press conference, the load a player at wing-back has to take on is much more than what he is doing now and would stretch Shaw's body to the maximum, increasing the chances of an injury.",
      "Even if United were confident Shaw has overcome past issues, now is not the time to trial him at wing back. United are about to enter their busiest period of the campaign and it would be asking for trouble to shift Shaw out wide.",

      "Sporting director Jason Wilcox explained this on a recent episode of the Inside Carrington podcast. He said: \"Last year’s summer window was a lot more chaotic than this one. This one was really calm, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "\"These are continuous meetings between myself and Ruben [Amorim] with Chris Vivell and his team underneath. We are very clear on the profiles that we need. The brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris.",
      "\"[There is] a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need and then the scouts will go into the market. We combine that with the data team and there will be constant dialogue. Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team of the profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable with Ruben as well. It is a really joined up approach.\"",
      "This is a world away from the recruitment plan under Erik ten Hag. At times it seemed as though he was solely responsible for identifying possible targets.",
      "While some of his ex-players have proven to be decent buys - Lisandro Martinez started well and Matthijs de Ligt is getting better every week - many others fell short of the required standard. But if Wilcox is true to his word and the manager still has a say in recruitment, the board need to listen to what Amorim had to say this week.",
      "Amorim was asked why his team's level was dropping off in the second half of matches. In response, the Portuguese head coach highlighted two players' absences - two players who could no longer be with the Reds at the start of next season.",
      "He said: \"I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players. Not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.\"",
      "The United duo are both out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, neither man will be staying beyond then. Casemiro has stated he wishes to continue playing football beyond this campaign. Despite United having an option to extend his contract by a further 12 months, the Reds would rather negotiate a new deal to lower his salary.",
      "United have already used the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months and so a new deal would need to be struck. United will likely want to lower his wages to reflect the amount of playing time he will have beyond 2026.",
      "Maguire seems the most likely to stay at present but if one, or both, of these players leave Old Trafford in 2026, United have a job on their hands to replace them. Amorim knows neither man is the future of United but what they both have shown is that the team looks weaker when they are not on the pitch.",
      "This should have alarm bells ringing inside Old Trafford. Replacing players with such Premier League and European experience will be a difficult task and this interview alone has ensured the issue has been flagged early.",
      "If both end up leaving, United will need to replace them with quality, experienced players. If they are not able to, they risk losing key squad depth for 2026/27.",

      "Matheus Cunha has suffered an accident while training with Manchester United, as per reports. The Brazilian forward recently returned from international duty to join Ruben Amorim and his team-mates to prepare for the side's upcoming clash with Everton, which is set to take place at Old Trafford on Monday evening.",
      "However, it has now emerged that Cunha has suffered an accident on the training ground. The 26-year-old was set to turn on the Christmas lights in Altrincham on Saturday evening, but VisitAltrincham broke the news that the player would no longer be able to attend due to 'medical reasons.'",
      "The page wrote on Instagram: \"Unfortunately, Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight’s Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons.\" The club are yet to comment.",
      "It comes as most of the Manchester United squad returned to Carrington this week after a two-week international break for the final round of World Cup qualifiers.",
      "However, a number of stars were absent, including Benjamin Sesko, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo - each of whom are recovering from respective injuries. It comes as United look to climb the Premier League standings when they play host to a rejuvenated Toffees side under the tutelage of David Moyes on Monday.",
      "The Reds head into the fixture unbeaten in their last five outings, as a result of wins over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham. At the time of writing, the club sit 10th in the Premier League standings after 11 matches, just eight points shy of table toppers, Arsenal.",
      "However, Amorim a number of injuries to navigate headed into his side's clash with Everton on Monday evening. Sesko picked up a knee injury during United's match against Spurs ahead of the international break, and is not expected to return until December as a result.",
      "Maguire was also replaced during the same encounter as a result of a hamstring issue, with Amorim admitting that he \"is not ready\" in time for his club's upcoming match.",
      "Mainoo, meanwhile, missed out on the Reds' game with Spurs altogether as a result of a knock, although he could potentially feature at the Theatre of Dreams come Monday dependent on his recovery.",
      "Elsewhere, Lisandro Martinez could also make his long-awaited return to Premier League football against the Toffees. The Argentinian centre-half suffered an ACL injury back in February which has kept him side-lined for the best part of 2025, although he is reportedly nearing a return to full fitness.",
      "The 27-year-old returned to full training ahead of the international break, although Amorim opted against playing him immediately. While he failed to receive a call-up for his nation, Martinez did link up with Argentina to train and continue his road to full fitness during the break.",
      "On the possibility of featuring on Monday evening, Amorim said: \"Licha is getting close to be playing,\" in a statement which will be welcomed by United fans worldwide.",

      "Gary Neville told Jamie Carragher that he could be 'in trouble' this season as a result of his earlier predictions for the Premier League.",
      "The Manchester United legend was joined by the Liverpool icon for the latest instalment of The Overlap this week, where the two discussed their respective clubs and their recent run of form in the English top flight. When Carragher addressed Liverpool's issues at the back during their conversation, he highlighted how Arne Slot must bring in a centre-half in January.",
      "That opened the door for Neville to ask if failing to do so would allow United to finish above their bitter rivals come season's end, with Carra less than impressed with the playful jab. He replied: \"I don't think so,\" before flipping the ribbing back at Neville.",
      "He added: \"You're desperate for that aren't you? He got ridiculed, didn't he, for his predictions? So, I'm well aware every week he's on the phone to people at Sky saying, 'Well, what did Cara say in the predictions? What what did they say?'\"",
      "Neville then shut down Carragher's joke, by replying: \"Well, my predictions, as we've established in the first day, Monday Night Football are more accurate than yours over time. But I actually think this season you're in a bit of trouble.\"",
      "In a moment of humour, Carragher then joked: \"I'm going to lose my job or something because I got my predictions wrong?\" as the group burst into laughter. When asked by Ian Wright what the two were referring to, Neville said: \"Well, he had Liverpool winning the league.",
      "\"I had United in the top four, didn't I? They could sneak into fifth. Do you reckon they could finish fifth? Get into the Champions League.\"",
      "It comes as Neville may have the last laugh on Carragher, given Liverpool's result against Nottingham Forest at Anfield on Saturday afternoon. Slot's side suffered a brutal 3-0 loss at the hands of Forest on home soil, courtesy of goals from Murillo, Nicolo Savona and Morgan Gibbs-White.",
      "As a result, they currently sit below Manchester United in the league standings, with the Reds also holding a game in hand considering they aren't set to return to Premier League action until Monday evening, when they face Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "Goal difference is the only thing separating United and Liverpool, who are in 10th and 11th in the league table respectively at the time of writing, although Ruben Amorim will hope to create a gap on Slot's side when they return after the two-week international break.",
      "United and Liverpool have seen contrasting fortunes from their last five fixtures, with United heading into their clash with Everton unbeaten in their last five thanks to wins over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, as well as draws with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, have managed just one win from their last five Premier League matches, suffering losses to United, Brentford, Manchester City and Forest, with their only victory coming in the form of a 2-0 triumph over Aston Villa.",

      "The AFCON will take place between December 21 and January 18. Bryan Mbeumo will represent Cameroon's national team at the tournament, while Amad is set to feature for the Ivory Coast. Noussair Mazraoui will also be at the tournament representing Morocco.",
      "Amorim has admitted United will \"struggle a little bit\" when they lose the trio, but explained during his press conference on Friday that talks will take place with the players' federations to keep them for as long as possible.",
      "\"I think it’s going to be more or less at the same time,\" said Amorim when asked whether Benjamin Sesko would return from his injury before United lose players to the AFCON. \"I don’t want to say for sure, but when they are going to camp [to prepare for the tournament], I expect to have Ben back.",
      "\"We have the rules about when to release the players. We’ll see, we’re doing our job to keep the players a little longer. But it's not just in our hands, and we have to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and the national team.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify when the rules stated United would have to release the players, and said: \"I think it's two weeks before the start, so we'll try to arrange something with the federations, but we need to respect their rules in this case.\"",
      "The United boss was asked whether the Wolves fixture on December 8 was an opportunity for other players to impress. \"Yeah, but we already knew [about players leaving], so it is a chance for other players. We need to also send a message. It is not ideal, they are so important in our squad,\" he said.",

      "\"Right away I knew would struggle in some things, but the feeling it is the best league in the world, maybe the best club. I think we are showing that [improvement], but the important thing is that it doesn’t matter what we did in the recent games.",

      "Most of the Manchester United squad were in training at Carrington on Friday as they prepared for the visit of Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night. The players were in good spirits as they made their way out onto a bright but crisp training ground this morning.",
      "Before the session got underway, Ruben Amorim organised a gauntlet which has become a staple of the training sessions. Among those to run it were Matthijs de Ligt, who started his first international game for the Netherlands since 2024 during the break, and Senne Lammens, who played for Belgium after an impressive start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "Once that team-building exercise was over it was time for the actual training session to begin. MEN Sport has taken a look at three things we noticed from the session ahead of the visit from Everton on Monday night.",
      "Three players missing",
      "Three players were notably absent from the training session this morning. Kobbie Mainoo did not travel to north London before the international break due to a knock and was missing again on Friday, albeit he could be involved in training on Saturday.",
      "There was greater concern over the two other absentees. Harry Maguire \"was not ready\" to take part in the session, with no timeline given for when he could eventually be featuring in training again.",
      "As for Benjamin Sesko, Amorim ruled him out after he missed training. \"He is going to stay a few weeks out,\" Amorim said. \"I don't know how long but it is not that serious we have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Martinez recovery continues",
      "One welcome boost saw Lisandro Martinez continue his comeback. He looked more than comfortable back on the pitch and seems closer than ever to being back with the matchday squad.",
      "When quizzed on the Argentine in his press conference, Amorim was cautious in giving a date for his return. He said: \"I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.\"",
      "Youngster involved again",
      "After Mainoo missed out on the trip to Tottenham, Jack Fletcher was given the opportunity to travel down with the squad for the game. Amorim said pre-match that he didn't want to lose the remarkable 88-year record of having an academy graduate in the matchday squad but he was confident, if called upon, Fletcher could do a job.",
      "You can tell the youngster is comfortable around the first team players as he was spotted having a quick joke with Noussair Mazraoui during training. This will be a good sign for the United head coach as he prepares for the academy to play a greater role when players leave for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "\"It is a concern but we already knew. There is an opportunity for other players. We have also the Under-21s and we need to send a message in that time so we will see,\" Amorim said when asked about the impending loss of players.",
      "\"But of course it is not ideal because they are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad but again, our academy is for these moments and they will be ready.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Amorim was asked to reflect on the changes he has witnessed over his first year in charge of the Reds. Monday will mark a year to the day since he stepped into the dugout for the first time in the 1-1 draw at Ipswich Town.",
      "Take a look at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below.",
      "That is all from the Amorim press conference. His full quotes from part one are below.",
      "It was everything going really fast. The first thinking was the environment was different in the Premier League and I was excited with that. Right away I knew that we would struggle with some things but there was a feeling that yes, it was the best league and best club in the world. But at the same time it was a big job and it is going to take a lot of work.",
      "We are showing that [improvements] but the important thing is that it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games we cannot forget that we still started in that point and suffered a lot last year and we have to take that into account. We have to play every game like it is the last one or the first one. But if you ask me, I expect a team with more control and more dominance, playing better football and the most important thing that we are more competitive in every way.",
      "He can play left wing-back but of course the load that a player does in that position is a little different if you are doing that on a daily basis. He is more prepared to do that position but of course he can play there, he is a smart player and he is fit in the moment so I think he is an option.",
      "A smart intelligent football player can play in a lot of positions but it is not the right position for him. He needs more time to work there and he is not working there but in an emergency he can play, but I am not thinking about that. I feel Licha is becoming close to being able to play. We need to be careful, he is going to struggle in the first minutes but he is clearly in a better position than he was two weeks ago.",
      "In our league, the table doesn't matter because everything is so tight that it is irrelevant. If you know the history of our team you never know when it is a difficult game. So that [run of fixtures] is completely irrelevant in the Premier League.",
      "It is a concern but we already knew. There is an opportunity for other players. We have also the under-21s. We need to send a message in that time so we will see. But of course it is not ideal because they are so important in our team and we don't have a long squad but again, our academy is for these moments and they will be ready.",
      "We have rules when we have to release players, we will see. We are doing our job trying to maintain the players a little longer but it is not in our hands but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.",
      "I think they will leave two weeks before the start so we will try to get something with the federations but we will need to respect their wills in this case.",
      "Maguire is not ready, Kobbie didn't train today but I think tomorrow we could see Kobbie so we will see.",
      "He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long but it is not that serious we have to be careful with him. He is going to recover. He is doing the recovery and he is feeling better so we expect in a few weeks to have him back.",
      "I think it is going to be more or less he will be back at the same time as Amad and Mbeumo leave for AFCON. I don't want to say for sure but when they are going to the camp I expect to have Ben back.",
      "Amorim is with us and the press conference is about to begin",
      "We are still waiting for the start of the press conference, stay tuned for further updates...",
      "Martinez looked comfortable during that training session earlier and it is expected he could play some role in the matchday squad on Monday. The big question is how easy he will find it to get back into the starting XI. Shaw has played excellently this season and while the Argentine will be eased back into regular football, there is no guarantee that he will eventually take the Englishman's spot.",
      "Amorim's press conference will be starting in just a few minutes...",
      "During the training session this morning, we have already mentioned that Sesko did not look to be involved with the rest of the squad. Two other absentees were Maguire and Mainoo. The centre-back came off injured against Spurs before the international break while Mainoo did not travel to north London due to a knock. We expect to hear why those two were not involved shortly...",
      "There is likely to be a slight delay to Amorim's press conference this afternoon. We should be hearing from the manager at shortly after the previously scheduled 1.30pm start. Stay tuned as we continue the build-up to the press conference.",
      "We are just half an hour away from Amorim's first press conference since the international break. Let us know what questions you hope he will address this afternoon in the comments section!",
      "A reminder that we will be hearing from Amorim this afternoon at 1.30pm. Ahead of then, here are the topics we expect to be covered during the press conference:",
      "United have just taken part in an open training session at Carrington and there appeared to be no Sesko with the first-team squad. Amorim will be providing an update on his fitness this afternoon at the press conference.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "To mark his first year in charge of United, Amorim sat down with the Premier League to reflect on the past 12 months. During the interview, he addressed the prospect of selling players to avoid potential PSR issues. And the Portuguese head coach hinted that academy players could be the ones leaving the club.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "We are expecting to receive an update on the fitness of Sesko during Amorim's press conference later. The Slovenian suffered a knee injury in the draw at Spurs and could not continue, leaving the Reds down to ten men for the final moments of the fixture. The centre-forward did not join up with his national team during the international break and there has been reports he could be out for a month. We understand that timeline is currently speculative but Amorim should shed more light on the matter today.",
      "United have confirmed they will officially open one of the largest safe standing sections in the Premier League when Everton make the trip to Old Trafford on Monday night. United installed 6,000 additional rail seats in the second tier of the Stretford End in September. The work has now been completed and certified by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority for safe standing.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim is set to address the media at 1.30pm this afternoon. We shall provide you with everything the United boss has to say as soon as we hear it.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will be addressing the media this afternoon from Carrington for the first time since the draw at Tottenham earlier this month. That game continued the Reds' unbeaten run and left United just a point outside the top four. The focus will be on injuries ahead of the game with question marks surrounding the fitness of Sesko.",
      "Stay tuned for updates from Carrington right here."

      "Ruben Amorim believes the mindset of his Manchester United players needs to change when they hold the lead in games. The Reds were leading 1-0 at Tottenham before the international break but had to settle for a point after a disappointing second half display.",
      "The same thing happened at Nottingham Forest a week earlier, where United struggled in the second half after dominating the first. In the victory over Brighton, the Reds were almost punished when they were pegged back to 3-2 having been cruising earlier in the contest.",
      "In an interview with the Premier League, Amorim was asked why there has been such drop-offs from his team of late. He replied: \"I think we lose intensity. I think we have some problems in two games that we lost, we lose Casemiro with some pain, Harry Maguire the same thing, and they are key players not just the way they play and the experience they have, the set pieces and people don’t take that into consideration.",
      "\"I think when we are in advantage, we lose that thing of wanting to continue to press in the same way. We had that against Brighton until we suffered the first goal. So it’s a lot of things together. We think about 'let’s not suffer a goal' and our mindset should be 'we have one goal, we must get another and have the opportunity to kill the game'. So it is mental but it is also physical, we need to improve in that aspect also.\"",
      "Amorim's thoughts are shared by his United players. Speaking after the Spurs draw, Matthijs de Ligt explained how fatigue played a role in the result. He said: \"Luckily we got a point, I think we deserved more the way we played, I felt the second half we were a little tired. We didn't get the chance to get out of our half.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu outlined his grand ambitions for the season when he spoke to Manchester-based correspondents in August, revealing he wanted to win the Premier League and play for Denmark at the 2026 World Cup. The reality is United are a world away from winning the title, but the club staff member who sat in on the interview felt that specific quote reflected Dorgu's ambition and determination.",
      "Unfortunately for Dorgu, his ambition to play at the World Cup next summer may not be realised because Denmark were defeated 4-2 by Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night. If Denmark are to book their place at the tournament they will have to qualify via the play-offs. They played at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and Dorgu will be hoping to help his nation reach a third successive tournament.",
      "Dorgu was on the losing side in Scotland, but he notched his third international goal for Denmark when he made it 2-2 with 10 minutes remaining. It was a decent finish in the box, which should give him some much-needed confidence ahead of the return of the Premier League this weekend.",
      "The defender started in United's opening two games of the Premier League season, however, he was dropped to the bench against Burnley before starting the next three games. Ruben Amorim dropped Dorgu again in a recent run of matches against Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, preferring Diogo Dalot to start at left wing-back. Dalot struggled at the City Ground and Dorgu was recalled to face Tottenham before the international break.",
      "When fans have watched Dorgu this season, they have wanted Dalot to start at left wing-back. When Dalot has come into the team, they have wanted Dorgu to return to the side. The biggest criticism of Dorgu is his lack of end product. The 21-year-old often finds himself in promising positions down the left wing, but his crosses into the box leave a lot to be desired.",
      "Dorgu has recorded just a single assist this season, which isn't good enough considering the areas he roams into. The ball must have fallen to him in promising positions half a dozen times during the Manchester derby in September, and he wasn't able to carve out a goalscoring opportunity for a teammate.",
      "Although Dorgu was naturally disappointed after Denmark's defeat to Scotland, it was at least a reminder that he can provide value in the final third after an unconvincing spell in a United shirt. Dorgu is likely to start when United welcome Everton to Old Trafford on Monday night. Dalot needs to be taken out of the firing line, but he could be quickly recalled if Dorgu doesn't perform.",
      "There has been no perfect option for Amorim on the left side of the team, but Dorgu now has an opportunity to kick on following his goal for Denmark during the international break.",
      "While the Danish press were complimentary of Dorgu's goal against Scotland, they picked up on what every United fan has been saying: his crosses into the box weren't good enough.",
      "That is the area of Dorgu's game that must improve if he wants to establish himself as a consistent starter. Amorim's system relies on the wing-backs contributing in the final third.",
      "It must be factored in that Dorgu only arrived at Old Trafford from Lecce a little over nine months ago, but a new signing in his position may be considered if he doesn't start to perform.",
      "The good news is that Dorgu seems like a confidence player, someone who will perform better after scoring a goal. During his interview at Carrington in August, he admitted he took a shot from distance on the opening day of the season against Arsenal purely because his confidence levels had increased.",
      "Dorgu looked sharp throughout pre-season in the United States and approached the campaign full of confidence, but he hasn't played like someone brimming with self-belief in recent weeks.",
      "Perhaps regaining that confidence will be the key to Dorgu improving when domestic football returns.",

      "Manchester United's chances of signing Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi have received a significant boost, with reports indicating the forward is actively planning his departure. The German sensation has been on the Reds' radar for some time as they look to enhance their attacking options under Ruben Amorim.",
      "While securing Adeyemi has proven elusive so far, the tide may be about to change with the January transfer window just around the corner - particularly as the 23-year-old appears set on leaving Dortmund. Bild reports that Adeyemi is eager to depart the club at the season's end, with contract renewal talks having hit a deadlock.",
      "However, Dortmund have reportedly slapped a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "The striker's current contract runs until 2027, and he will only agree to a new deal if it includes a release clause - a stipulation that the German giants are reluctant to accept.",
      "This could lead Dortmund to cash in on Adeyemi rather than risk losing him on a free transfer in 18 months.",
      "It's also suggested that the forward has signed up with super agent Jorge Mendes, with discussions already underway with United and Inter Milan regarding a potential move.",
      "Adeyemi made the move to Dortmund from Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg in 2022 and has scored 29 goals in 121 appearances.",
      "Whether United can secure a deal for Adeyemi remains uncertain, although the Red Devils appear keen to bolster their midfield first.",
      "A number of prominent targets have been identified, including Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Atletico Madrid's Conor Gallagher.",
      "The Reds' have repeatedly stressed their determination to bolster the squad under Amorim's guidance.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Man United's technical director Jason Wilcox told the club's website last month.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions Leagues, win Premier Leagues, we have got to invest in the squad.",

      "Manchester United can count their lucky stars that they never broke the bank to sign Evan Ferguson.",
      "United had tracked the Irish striker for years, with scouting reports dating back to his teenage days at Bohemians. The club even came close to a £50million move last summer - a dream destination for Ferguson, who admitted to supporting United as a boy.",
      "\"I supported United as a boy,\" Ferguson told the Daily Mail. \"You had the Rooneys, the [Dimitar] Berbatovs and obviously Danny Welbeck. They’ve always had a good thing going with the striker.\"",
      "But Ferguson's career has stalled in recent years, and he's now struggling at Roma with no goals to his name this season. He has recently been battling an injury, but could soon find himself facing the prospect of less game time.",
      "That's because Roma are interested in signing Joshua Zirkzee, a player who is well down Ruben Amorim's pecking order and has seen just 90 minutes of action all season.",
      "The fact that Roma are planning to effectively replace a striker who was considered one of the world's brightest prospects only a few years ago with Zirkzee speaks volumes about his drop-off.",
      "In hindsight, United can count themselves fortunate they never pulled the trigger, especially considering their history with expensive mistakes.",
      "Whether or not United allow Zirkzee to leave in January is another matter. Benjamin Sesko's knee injury presents a potential pathway back into the first team, though Matheus Cunha is expected to be Amorim's go-to man in the Slovenian's absence.",
      "Sesko could be out for three to five weeks, so Zirkzee has a window to show his worth. With attackers Amad and Bryan Mbeumo heading to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to represent Ivory Coast and Cameroon, respectively, United will be short of attacking players, with reports earlier this year claiming that Zirkzee won't be allowed to leave in January as a result.",
      "The 24-year-old has been linked with a move away in the New Year with hopes of getting more regular first-team action ahead of the World Cup next summer. The Daily Mail claim that Roma is one of striker's main options and that the striker will push for a move away if minutes between now and the transfer window don't prove forthcoming.",
      "The report added that those close to the player feel a 'crucial opportunity' is opening up for the 24-year-old due to Sesko's injury but only time will tell if he benefits from it or not.",
      "Roma will be monitoring the situation closely, with an eye on pursuing a loan with an option to buy. Their interest in him perhaps comes as no surprise, given Ferguson, 21, has zero goals in 10 appearances this season.",
      "Artem Dovbyk has also regularly led the line for Roma but has hardly been prolific himself, with two goals in 14 games.",
      "Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini previously called on Ferguson to do more but has vowed to be patient with him. \"He has to deliver on the pitch and his performances haven't been positive,\" he said last month.",
      "\"To be honest, yesterday was the first time I saw him train properly. He's coming from the Premier League, and he hasn't played much last season. We need to be patient with him.\"",
      "However, reports in Italy claim that Roma want to renegotiate the terms of the loan deal, with the 21-year-old potentially returning to the Seagulls in January.",
      "United have made plenty of errors in the transfer market in the past and come under scrutiny for it. Ferguson's name could've been added to that list, given how his career has gone since his breakthrough at Brighton but the club got it right this time by holding fire.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay and his international teammates can proudly sit alongside the likes of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce on the list of Scotland's national heroes. The pubs and bars of Scotland toasted McTominay on Tuesday as the midfielder played a crucial role in securing World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998.",
      "Scotland won 4-2 against Denmark to seal their place at next summer's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. McTominay was born in England and qualifies for Scotland through his father, but there is no English blood in McTominay's veins as far as the Scots are concerned.",
      "The adulation McTominay receives with Napoli and Scotland is something he didn't get during his time at Manchester United, the club that moulded him into a man from the academy.",
      "The 28-year-old departed United to join Napoli last year and won the Scudetto in his first season. He was nominated for the Ballon d'Or and ranked as the 18th best player in the world.",
      "McTominay's breathtaking acrobatic goal against Denmark wasn't even a shock because that kind of strike has become his level now - his story since leaving United has been phenomenal.",
      "The execution was outstanding and it will be remembered as one of the great goals in Scotland's history. It was so good that it will be compared to Gareth Bale's bicycle kick in the Champions League final against Liverpool in 2018, and Wayne Rooney's effort against Manchester City in 2011.",
      "McTominay was a good player during his time at United, had achieved his dream of playing for his boyhood club and had played in the Champions League, but he has moved onto another level since moving to Naples.",
      "When McTominay signed for Napoli, there was a conversation about whether United were right to sell him, and the chatter has started again following a hugely successful 18 months.",
      "A few months after McTominay's departure, he admitted that it was a \"huge decision\" to leave United, but he said he had no regrets. McTominay needed to leave the club to progress and United were ultimately right to sell him, despite the level he is performing at now.",
      "McTominay scored 10 goals in all competitions in his last United season. He tended to produce when United needed a goal, scoring a brace against Brentford in October's 2-1 win, twice against Chelsea in December in another 2-1 victory and netting the winner against Aston Villa in February.",
      "However, he was not a regular starter and contributed mostly from the bench, which led Scotland manager Steve Clarke to suggest that he looked unhappy. \"I thought: Maybe he's right,\" he said last year.",
      "United received a fixed fee of €30.5million (£25.7m) for McTominay and inserted a 10 per cent sell-on clause into the deal. The transfer represented 'total profit', which helped United operate within Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR), and it helped to offset incomings that summer.",
      "The club needed to raise cash to alleviate PSR pressure and McTominay wanted to leave. The second point is that McTominay wouldn't have reached his current level if he had stayed in Manchester.",
      "McTominay needed a fresh start. He needed to play somewhere where he would be a key player. He has grown with that responsibility for club and country, but McTominay was never going to be the 'main man' at United, who theoretically should have more naturally 'talented' players.",
      "The final point is that even if McTominay had stayed at United in the summer of 2024, he likely would have felt compelled to leave the club following Ruben Amorim's appointment.",
      "McTominay wouldn't have fitted into Amorim's system and would have been limited to substitute appearances. Just look at Kobbie Mainoo, who can't get a kick because Amorim doesn't believe he is a player of the right profile. Mainoo has been given something to think about watching McTominay.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were signed in the summer to start in the No.10 roles. McTominay would have been behind that pair in the pecking order, and he would have also been down the pecking order if he had been regarded as a deeper midfielder, like Mainoo has this season.",
      "It's understandable that some fans have said United should have kept McTominay on the back of his success, but logic dictates it was right for both parties to go their separate ways.",
      "United still miss McTominay in some ways. Different sources who have been present at Carrington over the last few years all praised McTominay's character and his behaviour around the training ground with staff members and young players. He was a leader and understood the club.",
      "There were some brilliant moments during McTominay's time at United, like his performance against PSG in the Champions League in 2019, his goal against Manchester City in the last game at Old Trafford before the pandemic and, of course, his brace against Brentford during his final season.",
      "But McTominay had to leave Old Trafford to really spread his wings.",

      "It was a sight for sore eyes this week as images from Carrington were released. Front and centre in the Manchester United training photos was Lisandro Martinez, celebrating another milestone since his ACL injury picked up vs Crystal Palace in February.",
      "It was a measure of Martinez's character that he has been pushing for a return to the first-team squad for weeks. Ruben Amorim admitted he told the defender he could not travel for the trip to Nottingham Forest last month.",
      "He was not risked a week later either for the draw at Tottenham Hotspur and his absence was understandable. Martinez has been out since February and rushing the defender back, potentially aggravating the injury further would have been a foolish decision having come this far on his recovery.",
      "Missing out on the Spurs game almost guaranteed we would see Martinez back among the first-team when they returned to Carrington post-international break and that is how it shaped up. However, his role at the club has changed beyond what anyone was expecting.",
      "When he left the field against Palace, United were losing more than just a member of their leadership group. Martinez was the leading defender at the club and a guaranteed starter in the back five, considering the lack of options available to Amorim.",
      "But when he returns this weekend, he will find that his once guaranteed starting spot in the United team now belongs to Luke Shaw. When Martinez joined the injury room at Carrington, Shaw was there waiting for him as he continued his recovery from a muscular injury.",
      "That was his third major injury of the 2024/25 season and it was looking unlikely Shaw would ever be in a position again to challenge for a regular starting XI position. Fast forward to November, and Shaw has featured in 11 straight Premier League matches for the first time since 2023.",
      "The Englishman is there on merit too. Barring the much-publicised disappointing performance against Manchester City, Shaw has been one of the top performers on the left of the back three, and it was surprising not to see him called up for England.",
      "Coming back into the fold at United, Martinez now faces the prospect of being forced to wait for his chance in the starting XI. The Argentine will have expected to be eased back into the first-team but even when fully fit, he is waiting for Shaw to slip up to take his chance.",
      "This will be a challenge that Martinez will undoubtedly relish but it is a big 18 months ahead for the 27-year-old. He is out of contract in the summer of 2027 and if he doesn't manage to replace Shaw, there's a chance his time at the club could be coming to an end.",

      "Lisandro Martinez's absence from the Manchester United first team has been painstakingly long. The Argentine suffered an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February and since then he has missed 35 United matches over 291 days.",
      "Much has changed for United since Martinez left the pitch at Old Trafford on a stretcher against the Eagles. Perhaps most notably, there is optimism that the club have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim. United are on a five-game unbeaten run and are good value for their position just a point outside the top four.",
      "Something else that has changed during Martinez's absence from the first-team squad is Casemiro's role in the team. The Brazilian has become an undroppable for Amorim having previously been written off by some.",
      "However, an impending problem will be concerning the Reds. Casemiro is the only defensive midfielder in the squad who has Amorim's trust. Manuel Ugarte is the Brazilian's back-up but the Uruguayan has struggled since moving to Old Trafford and has yet to show the club the form he produced under Amorim at Sporting.",
      "While Casemiro is fit and firing this isn't so much of an issue. However, the 33-year-old finds himself just two bookings away from a suspension and he's also no stranger to suspensions due to red cards.",
      "Since arriving at Old Trafford, the Brazilian has missed ten matches due to suspension. He picked up a needless red card earlier in the season against Chelsea for a foul an experienced player like him shouldn't have been making.",
      "There's also the issue of the Christmas schedule on the horizon. At 33 Casemiro will struggle to play to his best every three or four days and yet it's tough to see Amorim showing faith in Ugarte and affording Casemiro a rest.",
      "Ugarte was off the pace when brought on against Tottenham and it was no surprise that both the goals they conceded at Spurs came after Casemiro had been replaced by Ugarte. Until United can delve into the transfer market and sign a midfielder, Amorim needs to find a solution to this problem from within his current squad. And Martinez could be an option.",
      "In the 2019/20 season, under the management of Erik ten Hag, Martinez played 22 times as a defensive midfielder for Ajax. Martinez is more than capable of breaking up play and also has the passing range needed to play in midfield.",
      "Moving Martinez into midfield is certainly not a long-term solution and United will sign a midfielder in the summer, but he is an option for the foreseeable.",
      "Ten Hag admitted back in 2021 that he didn't think Martinez \"had the legs\" to play in midfield. However, United have worked hard to ensure Casemiro isn't exposed and left with too much ground to cover, so this might not be so much of an issue were Martinez to move into midfield.",
      "Amorim knows he needs as many options at his disposal as possible heading into the festive period, especially in midfield to support Casemiro.",
      "Even if it is not the ideal solution, it is at least an option for the United head coach.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Chelsea) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Manchester City) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Crystal Palace) – £45m",
      "5th (Brighton) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Sunderland) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Bournemouth) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Spurs) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Aston Villa) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Manchester United) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Liverpool) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Everton) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Newcastle) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Fulham) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Nottingham Forest) – £13.3m",
      "17th (West Ham) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Leeds) – £7.9m",
      "19th (Burnley) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",
      "=1st) Aston Villa and Manchester United (21 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £18.5m in 2024/25",
      "3rd) Nottingham Forest (20 games) – worth around £17.7m",
      "=4th) Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle (19 games) – worth around £16.9m",
      "=8th) Manchester City and Spurs (18 games) – worth around £16.1m",
      "10th) Leeds (16 games) – worth around £14.3m",
      "=11th) Brentford, Crystal Palace, Everton and West Ham (15 games) – worth around £13.5m",
      "15th) Fulham (14 games) – worth around £12.6m",
      "=16th) Bournemouth, Sunderland and Wolves (12 games) – worth around £11m",
      "19th) Brighton (11 games) – worth around £10.1m",
      "20th) Burnley (9 games) – worth around £8.5m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Newcastle and Manchester City shared an absurd first half but the Magpies won in a six-minute second-half burst which Pep Guardiola couldn’t handle.",
      "Liverpool are utterly broken after being picked apart by Nottingham Forest. And it is fair to question whether Arne Slot can fix the champions…",
      "Liverpool are bad enough for us to pretend Arne Slot might be about to get sacked and, thus, replaced.",
      "Few see Chelsea as legitimate title contenders but breezing through an awkward assignment at Burnley offered more answers to their doubters…",
      "West Ham have put themselves in a good place to survive by – and this is radical – playing a striker as a striker.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made a Manchester United transfer ‘reveal’ that you, dear reader, will simply fail to ever believe. There might be no point even trying."

      "",

Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.

      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to your Semenyos and Thiagos – doing anything all that compelling to challenge him.",

      "On how he feels after 12 months in the job at Man Utd, Amorim said: “The first thinking was the environment was really different in the Premier League and I was excited in that.

      "The Premier League clubs have voted in favour of squad cost ratio (SCR) replacing profit and sustainability rules (PSR) as the new system of financial fair play and the latest financial results reveal the three clubs which would be facing sanctions had it already been in place.",
      "The new rules will limit the amount of revenue a club can spend on player and manager wages, transfers and agents’ fees to 85%. Bournemouth, Brentford, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds voted against the change, but the minimum of 14 clubs was reached.",
      "Both Chelsea and Aston Villa were handed heavy fines by UEFA for the 2024/2025 campaign for breaching their SCR limit, which was at that stage 80% and is now set at just 70%. That far stricter level means a club competing in Europe next season could be sanctioned by UEFA but be compliant in the Premier League.",
      "Any team above the 85% mark in the Premier League – the Green Threshold –will face a fine, though they’ve provided significant wiggle room to avoid sporting sanctions, with a multi-year rolling allowance of 30% permitting clubs to spend beyond the limit.",
      "The Red Threshold is 85% plus the allowance; any club beyond that threshold will be given a six-point deduction plus another point for every £6.5m over that mark.",
      "It means that any Premier League club can have a squad cost at 115% of their revenue and avoid a points deduction, though those percentages will change for 2027/2028 and the seasons after that if some of the allowance has already been used.",
      "If, for example, a club spends 95% on their squad next season, they’ve used 10% of their allowance and can therefore spend 105% on their squad the season after, using the remaining 20% of their allowance, without sporting sanction. Got it? Great.",
      "Anyway, here are the revenues and squad costs of the 18 current Premier League teams who were also competing in the 2023/2024 season, the latest financial results available from Deloitte, ranked from lowest to highest squad cost/revenue ratio, which shows the three clubs that were above the new Green Threshold.",

      "Brus had heard that a £70m fee ‘might be realistic’ but now sources have told him that Man Utd are hopeful of at least opening talks for even less.",
      "One source told Brus: “Financially, the situation is complex.",

So, not closing the doors to the opportunity to bring in new players, and it’s already an update for Man Utd. But he also says, ‘I don’t want players for the short-term.’",

      "To suggest he would even have been in the minds of the voting journalists in his time at United would have been laughable, and the decision-makers at Old Trafford in no way merit the sympathy being afforded to them by Lineker on The Rest Is Football.",
      "“What a spell he’s having in his career. You know, he goes from Manchester United, probably his club that he played for since a boy.",
      "“And then he was probably, I mean, surely they must have seen the talent that he had?",
      "“But I suspect he was sold because of the PSR rules and you get, you know, a bigger advantage because he’s a homegrown lad, which strikes me as absolutely wrong.”",
      "Former United boss Erik ten Hag did indeed blame the perverse PSR rules when asked why McTominay was sold.",
      "“Selling a graduate is considered 100 per cent profit under current PSR rules and United sorely needed the cash. Unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",

      "We accept that United probably wouldn’t have sold McTominay for £25.4m if those rules didn’t exist. What we take issue with is Lineker’s claim that United in any way “saw the talent he had”.",
      "He was a squad player; no more than a guy who was ‘good to have around’. He started just 18 Premier League games in his final season and in the two campaigns in which he was the first-choice option he was one half of McFred having been inextricably paired with another player deemed not good enough to be starting regularly for the club.",
      "Conte realised his talent immediately. Having operated as a defensive midfielder in a double pivot in over half of his appearances for his boyhood club, at Napoli he’s played as a No.8, No.10 and even on the wing to ensure he can make the difference in the final third, where he’s evidently at his best.",
      "Pure profit or not, selling McTominay for just £25.4m is evidence enough of what United thought of a player who’s now easily worth twice that much.",

      "Brighton: Carlos Baleba\nJust imagine the fun we would currently be having if Baleba was putting in these almost comically poor performances compared to last season for a Manchester United side that had panicked into his £100m transfer.",
      "The downturn could be down to his head being turned, but if he turned it a little more often he may not get caught in possession quite as much, amirite? Crikey Moses he’s no Moises [Caicedo].",

      "Burnley: Marcus Edwards\nAt one stage linked fairly heavily with a return to Tottenham or to Manchester United in one of the clearest examples of football clubs confusing ‘looking at who happens to be playing quite a lot for Sporting’ with actual scouting. Edwards has made three substitute appearances totalling 21 minutes this season.",
      "",

But two of those assists came against Wolves, and should thus be stricken from the record, and he hasn’t managed another in his seven games since, scoring just one goal.",
      "In the cold light of day, having put down our ‘We heart Jack’ placards, we’ve come to accept that England are probably better off with a bit of speed on the left wing and our ‘top lads’ agenda may be clouding our view with regard to him playing in a No.10 position he’s taken up roughly thrice in the last five seasons.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Emile Smith Rowe\nWe can’t quite work out if he’s suffered or benefited from that 18 months or so when he was paired with Bukayo Saka as the future of Arsenal. The reputation built partly through that briefly inextricable link will have played a role in his move to Fulham, but also means we may always have expected too much.",

      "Leeds: Dominic Calvert-Lewin\n58 goals in 248 Premier League games raises one big question: How has a striker who’s only scored 58 goals in 248 Premier League games played 248 Premier League games? Take out a two-season glut and he’s scored 25 goals in 163.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Florian Wirtz\nWe’re currently at the anger stage in the Premier League flop process, barraged by Wirtz advocates, mainly hailing from his homeland, insisting Gary Neville and his other critics will soon be eating their words.",
      "If it’s anything like the stages of grief, and we suspect it is as Bundesliga voices have already had great difficulty accepting the reality of the loss of Wirtz in that initial period of denial, we can expect Alexander Isak and others to be put forward as bigger flops in a bargaining bid, before depression and finally acceptance that a) Wirtz was hugely overrated, and b) the Premier League is indeed, without question, The Best League In The World.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Tijjani Reijnders\nIt turns out a game against Wolves on the opening day of the season, after which Reijnders was hailed as Manchester City’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and David Silva in one neat little 82kg bundle, isn’t quite the harbinger of success many thought it was.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Senne Lammens\nWe very much enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek “are you Schmeichel in disguise?” chants from Manchester United fans as Lammens claimed simple crosses that his recent predecessors often contrived to make a mess of on his debut against Sunderland.",
      "But those tongues are now conspicuously absent from cheeks as genuine claims are being made about the 23-year-old being the undisputed answer to the Red Devils’ goalkeeping woes after literally five games of simple competency.",

      "Sunderland: Simon Adingra\nNot easy – they’re fourth, FFS – but of the 13 players Sunderland signed in the summer we were perhaps most excited by what Adingra might do having impressed in fits and starts at Brighton; it’s not really happened for him.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Rodrigo Bentancur\nNever has a footballer been more highly regarded on the basis of having some poise in possession. Bentancur is frequently seen as a key cog in the Tottenham midfield, and we wholeheartedly agree, but only because the other members of said midfield have as much poise as someone three sheets to the wind attempting to fumble their key into a lock.",

      "Wayne Rooney doesn’t immediately strike as the tinfoil hat-type, but it feels like the mere mention of QPR might at any point lead him off on a tangent which eventually ends in vehemence about how jet fuel doesn’t melt Taye Taiwo and Clint Hill.",
      "The Manchester United legend has a niche and it is carved out in cast-iron nonsense. And Mike Dean poured petrol on that particular dumpster fire earlier this week.",
      "“What was strange about it,” the former referee said on The Overlap, “is that once QPR found out they were safe, the game restarted and I think Jamie Mackie’s on the pitch, he’s going like that and celebrating while the game’s going on because they know they’re safe. They [Manchester City] make it 2-2 and they [QPR] just kick it back and give it to them.”",
      "And that much is true. Shaun Derry, who wore the captain’s armband for the final 40 minutes at the Etihad after a bout of generational headloss from Joey Barton, once said as such years later:",
      "“We kicked off and immediately knocked the ball into the far corner, as you would in rugby, trying to play for territory. Joe Hart came out and took a throw-in. I thought, ‘Why have we done that?’. It could have come back into me or into whoever in midfield and then back to defenders and into Paddy Kenny, and then you’ve taken 30 seconds off the clock.”",
      "But as chief kick-off culprit Jay Bothroyd added in the same Athletic article: “When I came on the pitch, Mark Bowen, Mark Hughes’ assistant, just said to me to try to hold it up, try and help us get up the pitch, and then once they scored, he was saying to me just kick the ball into the corner. Literally, kick the ball into the corner, get behind, get back to the halfway line and stay compact again.”",
      "If it was a grand scheme devised to undermine Manchester United then of course former Shimizu S-Pulse midfielder and Wales international Bowen was the mastermind.",
      "The reality was that a team facing the prospect of relegation for roughly 94 of the 95 minutes played, not far off half of which they had to play away from home against the best team in the league with 10 men because of Barton’s implosion, was simply exhausted.",
      "As with any decent conspiracy theory, there are salient points among the ruins of absurdity: the kick-off thing was weird; Djibril Cisse did celebrate with Samir Nasri – an old friend from their time together at Marseille – at the final whistle; and there were a handful of Manchester City alumni in the QPR side.",
      "Three, to be exact. The precise same number of former Manchester United players in the Sunderland team which dozed to a 1-0 defeat at the Stadium of Light 140 miles away, failing to muster a single shot from the 65th minute onwards.",
      "And Sir Alex Ferguson had an inside agent working for him in the QPR ranks. When Anton Ferdinand feels the need to reiterate four times in one sentence how he “was p*ssed off” at having cost his brother a Premier League title eight years after the fact, the idea that Manchester City benefited from a light dose of match-fixing starts to collapse in on itself.",
      "Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion, really ought to move on from the inability to make it a half-dozen. Not least because Manchester United lost the title on goal difference to a team which beat them 7-1 on aggregate that season, instigating one of the biggest yet most under-the-radar bottlings in history.",
      "But mainly because Rooney has unforgivably forced us into The Worst Person You Know Just Made a Great Point territory with his incessant cry-arsing about actual Manchester United being screwed by a team rolling over for one of their rivals.",
      "“To say that me, or Djibril Cisse, or Shaun Wright-Phillips, or Nedum Onuoha, or Paddy Kenny have somehow concocted to make sure you don’t win the league is b*llocks,” Barton said in October. With Rooney seemingly dangerously close to labelling each of the above lizard people Illuminati members who sleep with 5G masts, it is a line he would do well to retire.",
      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",

      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him.",
      "United are known to want to improve their midfield in January. While Casemiro has turned around a period of inconsistency, he’s due to be out of contract in the summer, while Bruno Fernandes is being played in a deeper role than he’d like.",
      "Other options Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo have struggled to convince Ruben Amorim they should be playing.",
      "Premier League stars such as Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are all being linked, but of late it has been suggested United don’t feel a move for any of them is likely in the winter.",
      "The option of Ruben Neves – who played 177 times in the Premier League for Wolves – could be an intriguing one, as Amorim is known to be a fan of his, and United have been credited with interest in him.",
      "Neves is out of contract with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the summer, and therefore Caught Offside reports he’ll be available for €20million (£17.7m) in the winter.",
      "But there is a key issue in that his £410,000-per-week wages have put off top European clubs, with the suggestion that if a move to United or another interested club such as Newcastle is to happen, the midfielder will have to drop his demands.",
      "The report suggests that at the moment, a move to Turkey looks most likely for Neves, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the mix.",
      "However, it is also suggested that if other top clubs don’t secure their favoured targets, there could be a lot of interest in Neves.",
      "A £17.1million price tag for a 28-year-old who starred during his time in England and has remained a fixture of the Portugal side since his move to Saudi would be a steal, though it’s not a surprise that the massive wages aren’t rousing many clubs.",
      "If United don’t see paying a big fee for any of the three Premier League midfielders they are tracking as plausible in the winter window, then they’re very unlikely to splash out on a huge contract instead.",
      "Neves would be a great signing in January if his wages were less of a strain, but they’d surely have to be significantly reduced, given the Red Devils’ highest wage is £350,000 per week, and that’s one of only two players who earn over £200,000 per week.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told Spurs they have “got to” land a former Premier League star on £410,000 per week, as a separate report has revealed his desire ...",
      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly identified former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves as their new ‘priority’ target in midfield ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’."

      "“So an interesting situation to follow because Neymar could consider a move in the January transfer window. Now Neymar wants to be 100 per cent focused on his priority, so to help Santos avoid relegation and to do his best for his club.",
      "“In this moment Neymar is not having any advanced negotiation, but some calls have started to understand the situation of Neymar.",
      "“When there is a player of his level available on the market, it is obviously an opportunity. Okay, maybe Neymar is not in the best physical condition now, Neymar is coming from an injury, he had several injuries recently.",
      "“But now he’s back, he’s fit, he’s trying to help Santos.",
      "“He’s trying to find his best condition, and so keep an eye on Neymar because he could be one of the names to watch for the January transfer window on a free transfer, and so that could be an interesting situation to follow.”",
      "Fichajes suggests a move to United is ‘viable’ but a lack of European competition – with global exposure said to be needed for Neymar to return to the fold with Brazil – is a drawback.",
      "But after three years away from an elite league, Neymar is in no position to be demanding anything of the sort, and United should steer well clear.",
      "They seem to have gotten themselves back into a good spot, challenging towards the top of the Premier League, and signing a past-it Neymar is not going to help them.",
      "Should he join and fail to have an impact – which is likely given he’s not played at a good level for years now – it may only breed discontent within the club, and they’ll have wasted a transfer trying to grant somebody his wish of returning to the Brazilian side.",
      "Further to that, they wouldn’t dream of signing a player with just three league goals in his last season were it anybody else, so signing Neymar would essentially be just for his name.",
      "It’s also a bad look for Neymar if he is to leave. After his emotional homecoming for the swansong of his career, to decide actually, these lot aren’t great and I’m better off going and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, perhaps isn’t the best call.",
      "Man Utd flop Antony is now being likened to Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar just months after Ruben Amorim sold him to Real Betis for £22m.",
      "Manchester City are prominent in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Cunha and Mbeumo are in but No 1) will never be shifted",
      "Man Utd are responsible for four of the most expensive signings ever of players between the ages of 13 and 36; they later released two of them."

      "A Manchester United attacker is felt to have a ‘crucial opportunity’ coming soon, but there will be a point prior to that in which ‘alarm bells’ could begin to ring.",
      "United’s attack has been more impactful this season than it was last. Indeed, they have scored 19 Premier League goals this term, only bettered by the league’s top three.",
      "They are also in reach of the top three, just two points from Chelsea in third, and four points from Manchester City, in second.",
      "Last term, when United finished 15th in the league, none of their players reached double figures for goals, and in 32 games, then-new signing Joshua Zirkzee scored just three goals.",
      "His last league goal came 23 games ago, in December 2024. The Dutchman has been given just 82 minutes of league action this term, and reports suggest he’s frustrated at his role.",
      "Some close to him reportedly feel, per the Daily Mail, that a ‘crucial opportunity’ is opening up for him.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is injured – having started six league games up top this season – and though Matheus Cunha is the preferred No.9 deputy, doing so against Tottenham in the last game, Zirkzee is another option.",
      "The upcoming game against Everton is seen as a significant one, with a view of what could be to come in January.",
      "If he is not used, or only used sparingly, then ‘alarm bells’ are expected to start ringing. It would be an opportunity for United to test out what their attack could be like during AFCON.",
      "Indeed, Bryan Mbeumo will be gone then, and Zirkzee represents an option to replace who has clearly been United’s best player so far this term.",
      "As such, if he can show he can deputise for Sesko, the Zirkzee might be given more minutes to bed himself in and get up to speed so that the loss of Mbeumo for weeks does not feel quite as impactful as it might.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has stated the desire is for Zirkzee to stay as an option across the attack.",
      "He said: “But the expectation is for three, maximum four weeks, out for Sesko. So the hope is to have him available at the beginning of December. This could be important to understand also the future of Joshua Zirkzee because Zirkzee would be open to leaving Man Utd in the January transfer window.",
      "“Maybe go on loan, maybe have the opportunity to play on a regular basis, but at the same time, he remains an important player for Man Utd. Look, now there is the AFCON, and so some players are going, there is the injury of Sesko.",
      "“If you have injuries, if you have problems, whatever happens, you need another striker, and Zirkzee can be used as a No.9, as a N0.10 behind the strikers. So for Amorim, he’s an important player. Amorim wants Zirkzee to stay.”",
      "Fabrizio Romano insists that Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee could still be asked to stay at Old Trafford despite “good” injury news on Benjamin Sesko.",
      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have performed a ‘U-turn’ on Casemiro, while one exit could ‘open the door’ for a ‘gamble’ January transfer.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee “should have stayed in Italy” with the Dutchman making the “wrong decision” to join the Red Devils, according to Ruud Gullit.",
      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s ex-chief scout.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee has decided his preferred destination as he heads for a loan exit in the January transfer window, says Fabrizio Romano."

      "Boss Ruben Amorim recently said it’s “really important” to keep that streak going, and in their last game, Jack Fletcher was the sole academy player in the squad, replacing Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "With AFCON coming up and each of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui heading off to represent their respective countries, there could be chances for academy players to represent the first team.",
      "That has been posed to the Daily Mail‘s United writer, Nathan Salt, who feels there is ‘honestly, not too many’ options for Ruben Amorim at the moment.",
      "He states that Shea Lacey is the ‘clear frontrunner’ having been very close to making the squad for the Sunderland game of late, while Fletcher – on the bench against Tottenham – is second, as Amorim is known to be a big fan.",
      "Salt feels shouts for Jaydan Kamason and Bendito Mantano to graduate to the first team are premature.",
      "There is said to be a ‘lot of interest’ in Lacey in regards to a loan away from United, but they are said not to be entertaining any, pointing to him being a player of interest in the first team.",

      "Lacey was the highest-rated player for United’s under-21s in that game, receiving an 8.7 SofaScore rating.",
      "Given Mbeumo and Amad, who are going to be unavailable for a while during AFCON, both play on the right-hand side, there could well be an opportunity coming for Lacey.",
      "Largely a right-winger, but also able to play in a slightly less advanced role if required, he could be in a good spot.",
      "Lacey is not the man it was felt is able to play up in the first team, by former United scout Piotr Sadowski, who named Harry Amass – currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "He said: “In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”"

      "That has now led to the Red Devils going five matches unbeaten in the Premier League with Amorim’s side up to seventh in the table, once place ahead of defending champions Liverpool and four points behind second-placed Man City.",
      "There were critics of Amorim’s decision to stick with his 3-4-3 formation earlier in the campaign as Man Utd failed to pick up results as it looked like he was heading for the sack.",
      "However, Amorim has turned things around using the same system and has highlighted that “more confidence” was the key to their recent positive form.",

      "“We are far from being that team that can win every game. So I think we have a lot to do, but I also have the feeling, and I’ve been saying this for many months, that the formation is not the problem.",

      "“If you look at the games we struggled in this season, it was not about the formation for me. It was the lack of intensity. We need to be perfect in this league to win a lot of games.”",
      "On the public backing from Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Amorim added: “It’s always really important, but it’s more important for the fans to understand that we have a clear path, and we are going to do everything and continue that path no matter what.",
      "“To be honest, it doesn’t change much for me, because I’m not worried about losing my job. I always have that feeling.",

Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are the ones to watch now – they want a major midfield signing and Neves fits the bill.”",

      "Friday 21 November 2025 14:22, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says he now expects his Manchester United team to be \"more competitive in every way\" as he prepares them for a Monday Night Football clash with Everton one year on from his first game in charge.",
      "Amorim got off to a flying start at Ipswich on November 24, 2024, with Marcus Rashford scoring after just two minutes but United were pegged back and drew 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on that game ahead of the anniversary, Amorim says he immediately realised the scale of the task he had taken on. But after what he himself called a \"disaster\" first season, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, he is quietly encouraged by the progress his side have made this term.",
      "United are five games unbeaten in the Premier League and sit sixth in the table, ahead of the weekend fixtures.",
      "\"There was everything really fast,\" Amorim said about his appointment and the lead-in to his first game as United boss.",
      "\"The first thinking was the environment is completely different. I was excited with that. Right away I knew we'd struggle in some things. But it was that feeling of this was the best league in the world, maybe the best club in the world but at the same time it's a big job, it's going to require a lot of work.\"",
      "On the progress his team have made during his year in charge, Amorim said: \"We are showing that but the important thing is it doesn't matter what we did in the recent games. We cannot forget we start in that point to suffer a lot last year, we have to take that into account and play every game like the last one or the first one.",
      "\"Of course, I expect a team with more control, more dominant, playing better football and, the most important thing, more competitive in every way.\"",
      "Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Benjamin Sesko would be out for \"a few weeks\" with the knee injury which forced him off at Tottenham in the final match before the international break and said the striker's return could overlap with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Harry Maguire will not be fit to face Everton but Kobbie Mainoo could be fit to return to action in time for Monday's game.",
      "It's not been a year to remember for Manchester United supporters - but in the past six weeks confidence has grown that, finally, Amorim may have their team on the right track.",
      "A first victory at Anfield in nine years, a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League and a flood of goals offer encouragement.",
      "Ending that incredulously long wait for back-to-back top-flight wins hints at previously elusive consistency in the team's play - aided, of course, by a £232m summer spend and squad revamp.",
      "There were fleeting moments of delight in Amorim's first season - the late win at Manchester City, for example, or the Europa League smashings of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club either side of that wild extra-time triumph against Lyon.",
      "The hope now is that something more substantial and long-lasting is emerging.",
      "But there have been so many bad moments, so many ugly moments, that, on Amorim's first-year anniversary, no United supporter should be getting carried away just yet.",
      "Amorim himself has described his side as \"probably the worst team in the history\" of the club (more of his knockout quotes to come later) and his return of 45 points from 38 Premier League games in charge is an inescapable reflection of how his reign has gone so far, i.e. not good.",
      "He has the worst record of any successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and his Premier League points tally ranks United 14th out of 17 ever-present teams across his time in charge.",
      "There have been many bruising defeats along the way. The Europa League final loss to Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham was the most costly, with United not only missing out on the trophy but also a Champions League place and the financial rewards that brings.",
      "It was also a defeat which further amplified criticism of Amorim's stubborn commitment to 3-4-2-1, with Postecoglou's own tactics change key to Spurs' win.",
      "There have been many wretched, painful defeats at Old Trafford, with home fans watching on as their side lost to Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham in the league and to Fulham on penalties in the FA Cup.",
      "But Amorim's most embarrassing moment was to come in Grimsby in August. The sight of the head coach frantically rearranging pieces on a miniature tactics board and then cowering in the dugout as his team contrived to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup by their League Two hosts was alarming imagery.",
      "More brutal defeats have followed, at Manchester City and then Brentford, but Amorim has clambered off the canvas. He and Manchester United are back on their feet for now. But will there be a knockout blow to come - or can they recover from the punishment they've suffered?",
      "\"If we want to win the Premier League we have to run like mad dogs. If not, we are not going to.\" - Amorim's rallying cry as he took charge of United. His team ranked 14th for distance covered and total sprints last season.",
      "\"In 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\" Amorim's stunning assessment of his side in January, before they finished in their lowest Premier League place of 15th.",
      "\"I would put [Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital [on] before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\" Amorim's brutal statement when asked about Marcus Rashford missing from the matchday squad at Fulham in January. Vital was 63 at the time.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day. But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.\" Amorim stands by his methods after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham.",
      "\"Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years… Sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players - this is my way of doing things. I am going to be like that. In that moment, I was so frustrated.\" Amorim explains what he meant when he said 'The players spoke really loud today,' after losing at Grimsby.",
      "\"When we win it's not the system; when we lose it's the system.\" Amorim bristles at continued criticism of his 3-4-2-1 set-up after defeat at Brentford in September.",

      "Friday 21 November 2025 20:02, UK",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has emerged as Ruben Amorim's most important Manchester United player this season.",
      "A stalwart at the back, the central defender is the only player to have played every single minute of United's Premier League campaign so far this term.",
      "With Amorim a known tinkerman, not least during games, especially at centre-back, De Ligt's ever presence is a testament to his growing influence at Old Trafford.",
      "When De Ligt signed for United in August 2024, Old Trafford had acquired a then-24-year-old who had struggled to live up to the lofty billing of his early career.",
      "Having captained Ajax at 18, De Ligt was tipped to become one of the game's finest defenders. He became the first defender to win the Golden Boy in 2018, the trophy awarded to the best U21 player.",
      "That was before his starring role in the Champions League as Ajax famously reached the semi-final in 2019, where his displays in that campaign propelled his worth.",
      "A move to Juventus came next for the defender, with the world at his feet, and Bayern Munich also followed. However, despite a healthy trophy return in that period, the pace of his early development had slowed, and De Ligt had become an injury-prone disappointment.",
      "Now, it seems as though De Ligt has been living through a personal renaissance. At 26, things have started to come together for the Dutchman. He's often used as the right centre-back in Amorim's oft-discussed back three but is more than capable of filling in centrally.",
      "On the opening day, a colossal performance, despite defeat to Arsenal, saw De Ligt take care of Viktor Gyokeres in a showing that paved for things to come.",
      "In the league, his performances have sustained, standing as one of United's outstanding options at the back. Among defenders at the club, De Ligt leads the way for aerial duels won and interceptions.",
      "De Ligt is also among United's best tacklers and passers, factoring in defenders at the club. They are performances that have been rewarded with a recall into the Netherlands National team by boss Ronald Koeman.",
      "For the Dutchman, his upturn in form is a reflection of a growing maturity and fewer injuries.",
      "\"I'm 26 now and I'm entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" De Ligt told Dutch outlet NOS.",
      "\"I've changed my mindset. Initially, I didn't want to make mistakes; now I want to do as many good things as possible.'",
      "Asked about his form, De Ligt added: \"There are a few explanations for that. I've had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body.",
      "\"This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "De Ligt's goal to earn United a draw at Tottenham just before the international break felt like the culmination of months of assured displays. However, despite his history as a leader, De Ligt was not named in Amorim's leadership group.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton and Noussair Mazraoui were put forward by Amorim as his group to oversee the dressing room at the beginning of the season.",
      "\"Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play,\" Amorim said following the draw at Spurs.",
      "\"Then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other.\"",
      "Amorim's growing reliance on De Ligt, may be a cause for the Portuguese coach to rethink his decision. However, despite De Ligt's form, Amorim believes we are yet to see the Dutchman at his flying best.",
      "\"He is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well,\" Amorim added after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball. That is a smart thing for a player.",
      "\"But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",
      "Amorim's words owe to his desire to one day see United be the dominant side when they are also the side dominating possession. By his own admission, currently, United are some way from that.",
      "However, with the in which he has established himself so far this season, the stalwart that is De Ligt may be the anchor of United's defensive plans going forward.",

      "Premier League clubs have approved a new alternative PSR, called Squad Cost Ratio (SCR); clubs will now be allowed to spend 85 per cent of their revenue, with these finances monitored each season; clubs voted against an anchoring system which many felt was effectively a 'salary cap'",
      "Friday 21 November 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have voted against a new proposal that could have brought in a salary cap from the 2026/27 season, with the division's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) to be replaced by Squad Cost Ratio (SCR) system from next term.",
      "The 20 Premier League clubs voted on three main issues - Squad Cost Ratio, a Sustainability and Systematic Resilience Proposal (SSR) and a Top to Bottom Anchoring (TBA) proposal in a meeting on Friday.",
      "The SCR and SSR rules were voted through, with the SCR voted through via the slimmest of margins. Fourteen out of the 20 Premier League clubs voted in favour of the SCR rules, which was the minimum number of votes needed to pass through the proposals.",
      "The TBA regulations - which would have limited spending on squad costs to five times the amount the bottom club receives from the Premier League in broadcast and prize money, and could have introduced a salary cap as part of its rules - did not receive sufficient support.",
      "Seven clubs were in favour of the anchoring system, 12 clubs voted against it - with one choosing not to vote.",
      "Before the vote on TBA, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and some of the UK's biggest player agencies were preparing to take legal action if anchoring was introduced. They felt it was effectively a salary cap on players.",
      "After a legal challenge in 2021, the PFA stopped the EFL introducing a salary cap in League One and Two.",
      "Players and agents warned the Premier League that any rules which included a salary cap would have be challenged in court.",
      "From the 2026-27 season, Premier League clubs will be allowed to spend a maximum of 85 per cent of their revenue on squad costs - which cover player wages, amortised transfers and agents' fees.",
      "Nine Premier League clubs playing in Europe this season are already bound by UEFA's SCR rules which limit spending to 70 per cent of revenue.",
      "A shadow form of SCR has been trialled in the background alongside PSR since the middle of last season.",
      "Each club will be set a 'green threshold' of 85 per cent of their revenues, and a 'red threshold' - an absolute spending limit up to 30 per cent over the green threshold.",
      "Assessments will take place on March 1 of each year after the January transfer window, with monitoring in October.",
      "If a club is above the green threshold, but under the red, they will receive a fine but not a 'sporting sanction', which would be a points deduction.",
      "If a club is above the red threshold, they will face a sporting sanction. This will be a fixed six-point deduction, which increases by one point for every £6.5m spent over the red threshold.",
      "Clubs can appeal both financial and point penalties. A club will have seven days to challenge the board's decision, having first informally written to the league to try and resolve the issue.",
      "According to the Premier League, PSR and SCR differ in what they measure.",
      "PSR evaluates a club's overall profit by including all revenues and costs, while SCR focuses specifically on on-pitch spending.",
      "By concentrating on squad costs, SCR gives clubs greater freedom to invest in other aspects of their operations.",
      "Under PSR, clubs are assessed based on their financial performance over a rolling three-year period, whereas the SCR sets clear spending limits for each season, which clubs must adhere to throughout that campaign.",
      "Compliance is monitored in-season as well as at the end of the season, allowing for earlier intervention if a club is breaching the rules. That means a club could receive punishments - for example, a point deduction - at any point of the season, rather than solely at the end of the campaign.",
      "According to the Premier League, this shift encourages clubs to manage their finances responsibly in real time, rather than relying on longer-term financial balancing.",
      "On top of that, because clubs announce their revenues in advance of the season, they are given more certainties regarding how much money they can spend.",
      "Under the PSR rules, clubs were susceptible to falling into financial trouble due to unforeseen dips in revenue - caused by poor performances on the pitch, a loss in matchday revenue or commercial revenues falling.",
      "According to the Premier League, it is introducing three SSR tests to improve clubs' financial sustainability and 'investability' over the short, medium and long-term, taking into account prevailing market conditions.",
      "The three tests are:",
      "Working Capital Test -  Assessment of a club's immediately available cash headroom across a season to ensure it can manage required outgoings and unforeseen fluctuations, particularly between transfer windows. A club must demonstrate that, for each calendar month over the course of a season, the sum of its projected cash balances and qualifying working capital funds is at least £12.5m.",
      "Liquidity Test - Assessment of a club's liquidity headroom over two seasons, including market value of player registrations, to ensure it can account for its current financial position and handle a variety of financial shocks inherent to the industry. A club must demonstrate that, for the current and following season, its 'Liquidity Headroom' is zero or positive having absorbed a 'Stress Test' of £85m. The Stress Test accounts for a variety of potential negative events, such as failing to qualify for Europe as one example.",
      "Positive Equity Test - Assessment of a club's balance sheet to evaluate its financial health, ensuring it has sufficient leverage to manage macro-economic factors. A club must demonstrate that its 'Positive Equity Ratio' (liabilities ÷ adjusted assets) is less than or equal to 90 per cent in the 2026/27 season, 85 per cent in the 2027/28 season and 80 per cent from the 2028/29 season onwards.",
      "Each tests take place on July 7 each year. For newly-promoted clubs, they will be assessed on the Liquidity and Positive Equity tests on October 31.",
      "Clubs may also face a 'Call-In Event' where they would be assessed further on whether they are complying to the rules.",
      "If they do not comply with the rules, the Premier League will offer solutions whereby the club could return to compliance. They could include voluntary spending limitations, cash injections, or rebalancing their debt or equity positions.",
      "Clubs could also be asked to present a business plan of how to bring the club back into within the rules. Failure to present a business plan would lead to sanctions from the Premier League.",
      "Those sanctions could include asking permission from the league to register any new players, a spending limit being imposed or more serious sanctions that are currently in place within the PSR structure, such as a points deduction.",
      "The Premier League is also closing a loophole which allowed clubs to sell assets to associated parties in order to comply with financial regulations.",
      "Under the current Profitability & Sustainability Rules, clubs have been able to sell assets to companies linked to their owners in order to increase their revenues to ensure they do not lose more than the permitted £105m over three years.",
      "From next season, the SCR calculation will be based solely on clubs' football revenues so there will be no regulatory benefit arising from asset sales to associated parties.",
      "In September last year, Chelsea's owners sold two hotels at Stamford Bridge to a sister company for £76.5m. They also sold their women's team to a parent company for £200m in June 2024.",
      "Everton also sold their women's team to a parent company in June, a move that is no longer possible.",

      "The offside trap is back at Aston Villa.",
      "It's not just a quirk, not just a tactical flourish, it's become the heartbeat of the defensive identity under Unai Emery. And crucially, there's a genuine correlation between Villa getting that line right and Villa winning football matches.",
      "Whenever Villa's back four snap into line as one, they suffocate opponents. Attacks stall, runners misfire and dangerous moments dissolve into a raised flag and a reset.",
      "Villa are catching the opposition offside 4.5 times per game across their last 12 games. And, in the last seven Premier League games they've caught 28 players offside - the most of any team by 10.",
      "It's no-coincidence then they've managed to win five of their last six Premier League matches. And Leeds do like to commit bodies forward in direct fashion. That tactical philosophy is tailor-made for Emery's razor-precise trap to flourish once again.",
      "All roads lead to backing Aston Villa to win at 6/4 with Sky Bet. If the flags are flying, Villa should be too.",
      "Gabriel is the lynchpin of this Arsenal defence - their high line, their aerial insurance policy and their most physical presence in the back four. Without him, Arsenal may have a problem in the next few weeks if his abductor injury is as bad as early reports suggest. Starting here.",
      "Tottenham under Thomas Frank will enjoy this derby day assignment.",
      "Few managers in the league coach 'underdog football' as effectively as the former Brentford boss.",
      "Frank's Brentford side made a habit of punishing big teams. The smart money says he'll try to copy-paste that blueprint here: frustrate, pounce, exploit the absence of Arsenal's defensive enforcer from both open play and set pieces. Spurs have the quality to make a big move in the game - like they did away at Manchester City and in the Super Cup vs PSG.",
      "The betting is obviously trending towards Arsenal at 2/5 with Sky Bet but that doesn't fully account for the defensive reshuffle forced by Gabriel's absence. Arsenal can and still probably will win, of course, but Tottenham suddenly have a real foothold in the match-up, and the market doesn't quite reflect it.",
      "Tottenham double chance it is then at 2/1 with Sky Bet. And, the 7/1 on an away win needs a good look, too.",
      "Manchester United should come with a disclaimer: 'entertaining but structurally unstable.'",
      "Ruben Amorim has a team overflowing with attacking talent, energy and moments of genuine quality yet one that carries enough defensive looseness to turn every 90 minutes into a wild ride. There have been 37 goals in their Premier League games - working to an average of 3.36 per 90. No team averages higher.",
      "They are the must-watch team in the Premier League because of it.",
      "Amorim has realised that they are a team built for moments - not for consistency - and he's embracing it.",
      "And, goals at both ends are becoming the smartest angle in United's games.",
      "This looks a clash where both teams will fancy themselves going forward and neither will fully trust themselves without the ball. Sky Bet go 10/11 on both teams to score and over 2.5 goals, and that looks very backable considering the direction of travel in United games.",

      "Saturday 22 November 2025 07:17, UK",
      "Which Premier League teams are overachieving and underachieving this season? And will Arsenal be caught?",
      "Eleven games in, the season's main narratives have already emerged.",
      "Arsenal are the team to catch following their strong start to the campaign. Manchester City, rather than faltering champions Liverpool, are seen as their most likely title rivals. At the other end of table, bottom side Wolves are already at risk of getting cut off.",
      "But what's your team's true performance level this season?",
      "Our expected table measures underlying performance data rather than results and the standings might surprise you.",
      "Crystal Palace are rated as the third-best performing team in the division behind Arsenal and Manchester City, while struggling Liverpool should be four places better off in fourth.",
      "Newcastle and newly-promoted Leeds are also underperforming significantly. They sit sixth and seventh in the expected table, eight and nine places better off respectively.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side face Everton on Monday Night Football on a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League but the expected table has them three places worse off in 10th, suggesting their performances haven't been as good as recent results suggest.",
      "One team conspicuous by its absence from the top half of the expected table is Sunderland.",
      "Regis Le Bris' side are flying high in fourth having amassed 19 points from their first 11 games following promotion but the expected table has them a whopping 14 places lower, as the third-worst performers in the Premier League so far, based on xG, with an expected points total of eight.",
      "Burnley and Fulham should also be in the relegation zone, with bottom side Wolves placing 17th. Wolves have only taken two points from their first 11 games but their expected points total is nine.",
      "Nottingham Forest, like Wolves, should be in a much better position, according to xG, but the expected table is grim reading for Spurs and Aston Villa, who should be nine and 10 places worse off respectively according to underlying performance data.",
      "But how will it look at the end of the season?",
      "Liverpool are predicted to come third despite sitting eighth as things stand, with Chelsea completing the top four and Manchester United in fifth, a position that could clinch Champions League qualification, depending on this season's coefficient.",
      "Crystal Palace are also predicted to clinch a European finish in sixth, along with Spurs, who sit a place below the Eagles in seventh. Sunderland are ninth, with Aston Villa only just squeezing into the top half in 10th.",
      "While Newcastle fans are hopeful their team's form will recover following a poor start, the predicted table has them 14th, which would be their lowest finish since being relegated in 2015/16.",
      "Relegation could become a reality for West Ham, according to our predicted table. The Hammers won back to back games before the international break but Nuno Espirito Santo's side are tipped to go down in 18th, along with Burnley and Wolves.",
      "That means Leeds, as well as Sunderland, are predicted to survive, with Burnley the only promoted team expected to go straight down.",
      "Nottingham Forest, currently second from bottom having appointed their third manager of the season in Sean Dyche, are expected to fight their way out of trouble and finish 16th.",
      "Have Liverpool lost their physical edge? Last week we revealed the alarming numbers behind their out-of-possession drop-off.",

      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 13:02, UK",
      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
