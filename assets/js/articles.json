      "Dan Ashworth's tenure as Manchester United's sporting director was a short-lived one, ending in disaster within just a few months. Ashworth was a prime target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who had to patiently wait over four months for him to officially commence his role due to being placed on gardening leave by his previous club, Newcastle United.",
      "It was on the 1st of July last year that Ashworth formally joined the Red Devils and immediately embarked on an ambitious recruitment campaign for then-manager Erik ten Hag, following United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.",
      "One of those other players was well-acquainted with Ten Hag, who was eager to reunite with. United shelled out £42m to bring former Ajax ace Matthijs De Ligt in from Bayern Munich.",
      "In a bid to provide Rasmus Hojlund with some assistance at the opposite end of the pitch, Ashworth activated Joshua Zirkzee's £34m buyout clause from Bologna after the Dutchman had aided the club in securing Champions League football for the first time in nearly six decades.",
      "Eager to bolster their defensive midfield – with Casemiro failing to replicate his Real Madrid form at the time – United sanctioned a move for Manuel Ugarte, who Paris Saint-Germain were willing to offload after just one season.",
      "A £40m offer was enough to secure the former Sporting CP star's services, eventually reuniting him with Ruben Amorim following the Portuguese boss' appointment as Ten Hag's successor last November.",
      "However, Ashworth departed United in December, before he could witness the outcome of his efforts. Over four months of the season had already elapsed upon Ashworth's exit and the performances of those three players left much to be desired.",
      "Despite De Ligt earning a formidable reputation in Europe since his teen years, he initially struggled to find his footing in Manchester's defence. While United endured a lacklustre season under Amorim, the Dutchman gradually found his rhythm in defence, sparking hopes among United fans that he will remain a key figure in their backline for years to come.",
      "The same optimism doesn't extend to Zirkzee, whose underwhelming presence has led United to continue their search for a striker to address their goalscoring issues – a role the former Bayern Munich forward was expected to fulfil.",
      "The 24-year-old has only managed to net seven goals in 49 matches across all competitions, with a mere three coming from Premier League games.",
      "His future at the club could be up in the air if Amorim succeeds in attracting ex-Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, despite Arsenal showing strong interest. Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also on United's current watchlist.",
      "As for Ugarte, the 24-year-old excels in tackling and regaining possession, typical traits of a defensive midfielder. However, he faced criticism last season due to his lack of forward play, with supporters arguing that his passing skills and athleticism are severely lacking.",
      "Amorim faces a colossal task ahead of the 2025/26 season, and it's yet to be seen what role these three players will have in United's future.",
      "And it seems unlikely that Ashworth's full quartet will be completed anytime soon. Branthwaite has recently signed a new contract with Everton under ex-United manager David Moyes.",
      "The England international, now reportedly valued at around £70m, inked a new five-year deal earlier this week.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "After a decade of loyal service to the club Son, who earns £200,000 per week, is open to moving on but he will also wait for the right opportunity rather than rush into a move.",

      "Arsenal have agreed personal terms with Noni Madueke and are now mulling over an approach to Chelsea in order to thrash out a deal for the versatile England attacker.",
      "Madueke, 23, is among a number of forward targets that Arsenal have been considering as they bid to add more firepower to Mikel Arteta's squad. And while the Gunners have seemingly settled on Rodrygo of Real Madrid as their top left-winger target, talk of a move for Madueke refuses to go away.",

United are rebuilding their squad in the summer transfer window and Amorim believes that Calvert-Lewin would be a good addition alongside more expensive signings.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived at United for £62.5million from Wolves and the club are still chasing Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, who will also cost north of £60m. But with the club conscious of profit and sustainability rules, they are also on the lookout for cheaper signings.",
      "Calvert-Lewin has left Everton after nine years and is looking for a new club. The 28-year-old striker scored 71 goals in 273 appearances for the Toffees after joining them from Sheffield United in 2016 and is seeking a fresh start.",
      "He has struggled with injuries in recent years, but The Sun reports that United believe he has the qualities required to bolster Amorim’s squad. They are ready to offer Calvert-Lewin a contract which would include bonuses for appearances so he could become a useful squad player in a role which could help avoid further injuries.",
      "United are still trying to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who all spent last season away on loan, as well as Alejandro Garnacho and, potentially, Rasmus Hojlund. With Cunha a No.10 and Mbeumo best off the right wing, Calvert-Lewin could slot into the forward line as a No.9.",
      "He managed just three goals in 26 Premier League games last season with injury sidelining him between January and May. But he is hungry for a new challenge after posting an emotional farewell to Everton upon the expiry of his contract on June 30.",

      "\"Whether times were good or tough, your unwavering support never faltered. Celebrating goals at Goodison Park, feeling that roar, is an experience I'll carry with me forever. This choice to move on was not simply about me, it was a decision my family and I spent a long time considering together.",
      "\"We believe it's the right moment to seek a new challenge and continue growing, but that doesn't lessen the bond I'll always have with Everton. I'm deeply proud of what we've shared, fighting for this club when it mattered most, scoring big goals in crucial moments, wearing the shirt with commitment and pride. My hope is that I leave with your respect, knowing I always sought to uphold the values of this great club.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to launch their opening bid for Botafogo star John Victor as they search for a new goalkeeper. A reshuffle between the sticks was anticipated this summer, with Andre Onana’s future looking uncertain.",
      "The former Inter Milan man has endured an inconsistent spell at Old Trafford since his arrival from Italy. It has been suggested that the Red Devils are open to letting Onana leave on loan this summer.",
      "And a few potential replacements have already been touted for him. Aston Villa star Emi Martinez is expected to be right at the top of their list, while Porto star Diogo Costa and Cruz Azul number one Kevin Mier have also been linked.",
      "Meanwhile Botafogo stopper John Victor emerged as a potential target following his starring role for the Brazilian side at the Club World Cup. It now appears that United are ready to make a tangible move.",
      "According to Goal Brazil, United have already submitted an enquiry to Botafogo and after a few meetings, they are ready to table an official offer. Victor would certainly be a more affordable option for the Red Devils given he has a £5.8m release clause written into his contract with his current club.",
      "Speaking last year, Victor’s agent Pedro Gutierrez admitted that there was growing interest in the goalkeeper. He said: “I have had many phone calls from clubs in Europe enquiring about John and that is no surprise after what he has achieved with Botafogo.",
      "\"There has been interest from clubs in England, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, but John would prefer to play in the best league in the world – the Premier League. Liverpool and Manchester City both have Brazilian goalkeepers in Alisson and Ederson and they have both been successful in England.",
      "\"John would like the opportunity to emulate those two and become the latest Brazilian goalkeeper to showcase his talents in the Premier League\".",
      "A potential move for Victor comes just weeks after Onana failed to commit his future to the Red Devils. Asked if he was set to stay at Old Trafford beyond this summer, he replied: \"Will I leave? I don't know, we'll see!\"",
      "Meanwhile, alternative target Emi Martinez also made some telling comments regarding his own commitment to Aston Villa. Speaking in the summer, he said: “My future? I don't know, I come here to play for the national team, and that's the only thing that matters to me right now,\" Martinez said. \"Do I want to move to a new club? The transfer window just opened, so there's still a long way to go.\"",

      "The Red Devils sold Elanga for £15m in 2023 and the Sweden international has thrived since. The Forest winger featured in all 38 Premier League games in 2024/25 and scored six goals and providing 11 assists as the club qualified for the Conference League.",
      "United are reported to hold a clause that entitles them to 15 per cent of any profit Forest make on Elanga. That would see Ruben Amorim's side rake in around £6m if their Premier League rivals do earn a £55m fee.",

Joining the Red Devils from PSG in 2004, a Premier League title followed as the Old Trafford faithful adored his full-blooded commitment on the pitch – until he tried to leave United under hugely controversial circumstances.",
      "Heinze's next move was viewed as self-sabotage of the highest order as the Argentinian star set fire to his United legacy when he attempted to force a move to Liverpool in the summer of 2007.",
      "In doing so he subsequently broke one of English football's most sacred yet unwritten rules: players not move from United to their bitter rivals and vice-versa.",
      "Heinze, now 47, is now set to join Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff at Arsenal ahead of the new season as the Gunners are in the midst of a coaching reshuffle, with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "Heinze's return to the Premier League will no doubt ignite memories of one of English football's most brutal transfer sagas of when the Argentinian was seeking to traipse the M62 divide and join then-manager Rafa Benitez at Liverpool.",
      "The controversial switch would have made him the first player since Phil Chisnall in 1964 to move directly between the two sides. Yet the union of Heinze and Liverpool will always be a case of 'What if?' Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson spectacularly dug his heels in to ensure that the defender would never get his wish.",
      "It began as Heinze's agent, Roberto Rodriguez, was reportedly informed by United's then-chief executive David Gill that he could leave for £6.8million. Yet United never foresaw that the full-back would clamour for a switch to their greatest rivals.",
      "An offer matching United's valuation was then indeed lodged by the Reds. However, the Red Devils knocked back Liverpool's proposal, to Heinze's dismay, and so lawyers were consulted.",
      "The legendary United boss also claimed United were in the driving seat over the move. Benitez however was left stunned by United's refusal to play ball.",
      "\"It’s clear he’s a player we like and he’s a very good player,\" Liverpool's Spanish boss said. \"That’s the reason why they don’t want him to leave for us.\"",
      "In another twist to one of the Premier League's bloodiest transfer tussles, it later emerged that Crystal Palace were offered the chance to buy Heinze by a South American-based agency, and then sell him to Liverpool straight after.",
      "This would allegedly pocket the Eagles £1m in compensation, as revealed by former Palace chairman Simon Jordan in his memoir, Be Careful What You Wish For.",
      "\"My stance was no way were we getting involved and I told Alexander to contact David Gill, Manchester United’s chief executive, and tell him of these attempted shenanigans, which he duly did,\" Jordan wrote.",
      "Heinze and his agent eventually took the case to a Premier League arbitration panel in a bid to engineer the move. However, Jordan's evidence was later used in the hearing which saw United prevail.",
      "After losing the right to move to Liverpool, Heinze told the Daily Mail: \"My fight is for the freedom to negotiate with any club. United never wanted me to leave for one of the big clubs, but this anti-Liverpool clause is incredible.\"",
      "Liverpool were reportedly expecting Heinze to appeal. Yet a late charge never materialised from the player as United accepted a bid from Real Madrid.",
      "\"I don't have many regrets from my career as a footballer, but that episode with Ferguson [has] to be one of them,\" Heinze later said of the ordeal. \"I spent three years in Manchester and had some great moments and I regret [leaving the club] a lot.\"",
      "After United, Heinze went on to play for Madrid, Marseille and Roma. The ex-Argentina international called time on his career in 2014 and has since ventured into management, however he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Arteta and Heinze previously played together at PSG but they will now reunite at the Emirates Stadium. It's fully expected that Heinze's journey to work at another of United's fierce rivals will be without drama this time around."

I asked him for it. I’m proud to get this number 10 shirt from Muniain. And to make history as he did.”",
      "And while Barcelona will be left frustrated by the news that Williams will not be signing for the club, it might see them look at alternative targets. Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has already been linked with a move to Spain.",
      "United chiefs expect Rashford to leave on loan this summer after his fall-out with Ruben Amorim. A move to the Premier League also appears to be off the cards, with Rashford ruling out a switch to London, while he does not want to take a cut to his lofty wages.",
      "And speaking recently, he hinted that he would be open to signing for Barcelona. Asked if he would like to play alongside Lamine Yamal, he said: \"Yeah, sure. Everybody in the world wants to play with the best. So hopefully, we'll see.\"",
      "When asked about a switch to Barcelona, he cheekily replied: “We’ll see.” Rashford added: “Spain is nice, not too far from home. If I train here for a long time, it’s good, because my family can come and see me for a few days, it’s only a three-hour flight. The weather is nice here.”",
      "Rashford has three years left to run on his contract with Man United. But he appears to have no future at Old Trafford so long as Amorim remains in charge.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Nemanja Vidic has revealed the one player who he had a bust-up with at Manchester United. Legendary defender Vidic enjoyed a trophy-laden eight-and-a-half years with the Red Devils, winning five Premier League titles and one Champions League.",
      "The Serbian left United to join Inter Milan in 2014, one year after Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager. Vidic established himself as one of the toughest centre-backs in the Premier League and took his no-nonsense mentality into training.",
      "Former team-mate Ben Foster described him as 'scary' and 'horrible' during sessions but Vidic insists that he only ever had one bust-up inside the dressing room. Speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, he revealed that Brazilian midfielder Anderson was the team-mate in question.",
      "\"At Manchester United, I had one bust-up in the changing room and that was with Anderson,\" Vidic explained. \"It was something on the pitch then it got transferred to the dressing room. It was no big deal.\"",
      "Some United fans will be surprised by the 43-year-old's claim, as Patrice Evra is on record claiming that Vidic refused to speak to him for three months. The pair's fractious relationship even prompted Ferguson to move Rio Ferdinand to the left centre-back role so that Vidic wouldn't be near Evra.",
      "In 2021, Evra told United's official podcast: \"To be honest, we also fought. We had a fight, me and him, and didn't speak for three months.",
      "\"We played together and we didn't even say a word. I never told him to go left or go right. He was the same. Ferguson had to swap Rio Ferdinand to play on the left side with me.",
      "\"It was like that for three months until, after a game, I remember he came to me in the dressing room and gave me a high-five. Everyone was like \"finally\" because we were best friends together, Vida and me. We have a deep story together.\"",
      "Vidic says that he'd like to be back in the Old Trafford dressing room one day but as the United manager instead. Discussing what the future holds for him a decade after hanging up his boots, Vidic said: \"If I was to manage or coach anyone, it would have to be Manchester United. I like things when they're difficult and to change something from difficult to good, this is something I like to do.\"",
      "He added: \"I am open an opportunity to be a coach, or to work in football as a sporting director, or even the Serbian president of the FA - that was the plan a few years ago - it didn't happen but maybe it could happen in the future.\""

      "Arsenal are set to add former Manchester United star Gabriel Heinze to Mikel Arteta’s coaching staff ahead of the new season. The Gunners have already had a coaching reshuffle ahead of the fresh campaign with former assistant Carlos Cuesta having departed for Parma.",
      "That departure has left Arteta with a vacancy to fill and it appears that he has turned to someone that he knows quite well in Heinze. As per The Athletic, the former Red Devils defender is set to be appointed at the Emirates as a replacement for Cuesta.",
      "Arteta and Heinze already have a prior relationship having been teammates at French giants Paris Saint-Germain. Explaining the impact that the Argentinian8 had on him, Arteta said: “The other inspirations were (Mauricio) Pochettino and Heinze, those two were next to me all the time, behind me, and they were guiding me in everything I had to do in my professional life, how I had to understand the game and they were inspirational to me.\"",
      "Heinze will join an already established team of coaches in North London that includes Albert Stuivenberg, set-piece coach Nico Jover, and goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana. All three have been at the club since 2021.",
      "Heinze represented PSG, Man United, Real Madrid, Marseille and Roma across what was a glittering career, winning league titles in England, Spain, France and Argentina. He was also named the United player of the year in 2005.",
      "The 72-time Argentina international retired in 2014 and has since moved into management with Argentinian sides Gody Cruz, Newell’s Old Boys, Argentinos Juniors and Velez Sarsfield, while he also had a stint with MLS outfit Atlanta United. But he has been out of work since November 2023.",
      "Meanwhile, the man who he replaced, Cuesta, has only just launched his managerial career and recently explained why he chose to leave Arsenal. Speaking in a press conference, he said: “I’m honoured to be part of a high-level club in Italy and abroad.",

      "After finishing the 2023/24 season with a -1 goal difference, they inexplicably only made one addition to their attacking ranks, with Joshua Zirkzee arriving from Bolonga.",
      "Zirkzee's haul of 12 goals the previous season did little to suggest he would be the solution to United's attacking woes, and so it proved. United tallied just 44 goals in their 38 Premier League outings last term, recording a -10 goal difference.",
      "The arrival of Matheus Cunha will certainly help, and if United can get a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line then they'll be well on the way to addressing their blunt attack. But a new striker is a non-negotiable. Even a top-half finish looks a stretch with Rasmus Hojlund and Zirkzee leading the line.",
      "The problem United have is goalscorers are hard to come by, especially when a lot of other clubs are in the market for one.",
      "United have already lost out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, and if the gossip columns are to be believed then Viktor Gyokeres could be on his way to Arsenal.",
      "Another big club who were on the hunt for a striker this summer were Juventus. The Serie A giants were always going to look to bring a striker in this summer, with their weak attack one of the reasons they failed to mount a serious title challenge last season. For context, Atalanta finished one place above Juventus in Serie A yet scored 20 more goals than Igor Tudor's side.",
      "Jonathan David's move to Turin means Juventus have got the striker they craved, and while David's move means there is one fewer striker on the market for United to target, it could help them in the long run.",
      "Completing one of their main summer objectives without spending a penny should free up funds for Juve to strengthen in other areas. Jadon Sancho has been linked with a move to the Allianz Stadium in recent weeks, with Alejandro Garnacho also tentatively linked.",
      "United know they need to offload Sancho and Garnacho this summer, with both players expressing their desire to explore options elsewhere.",
      "Signing a world-class striker for free would have been a great but of business by United - although there's no concrete evidence that the Reds explored a deal - but a club that's been linked with some of United's wantaway stars suddenly having some extra funds to play with might be the next best thing."

      "12 months on, and Watkins has fallen down the pecking order for club and country.",
      "He has not played for England in 2025, although injury ruled him out of the most recent camp, while he lost his spot at Aston Villa to Manchester United loanee Marcus. Ironically it's United who could offer Watkins a lifeline - and striker could do likewise for the Reds.",
      "He may be 29 and he may be valued at £60million - a figure that would surely need to be reduced for United to step in and do a deal - but he is a proven Premier League goalscorer with the attributes Ruben Amorim wants from his central striker.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund has failed to convince in the past two seasons and the Dane would benefit from time out of the limelight, while Joshua Zirkzee was never an out-and-out frontman and is more suited to a number 10 role.",
      "Watkins offers the perfect mix of a willing runner, goalscoring instincts and an ability to lead a line. His athleticism and finishing mark him out while his aerial ability is far better than he is given credit for and ranks him among the league's best for headers won.",
      "The former Brentford man is also a willing presser, a hard worker and an intelligent footballer. He knows when to press and when to wait, when to exploit space and when to time his effort, when to strike and when to come short.",
      "When he was coming through the ranks at Exeter, his then-teammate Jacob Butterfield used to talk to him about Cristiano Ronaldo and how to isolate defenders. Watkins listened and learned, a theme of his career from a non-league spell at Weston-Super-Mare as recently as 2018, to international duty.",
      "His preparation is meticulous and his desire to improve has impressed countless coaches and teammates. Amorim wants hungry players who are capable of slotting into his system and Watkins fits the bill.",
      "United cannot and should not be paying the £60m Villa have as a valuation given his age and the relative lack of re-sale value, but if the Reds can drive that figure down then bringing in a talent such as Watkins seems a natural move.",
      "He's the right side of 30 and has the ability to hit the ground running. United have moved for potential as much as the present with many of their signings under Ineos but if the Reds are to move the dial and secure a return to the upper echelons of the Premier League, they have to focus on the here and now.",

      "It may be 12 years since he left his boyhood club, but the United schooling is always on show for the versatile left-sided player.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "The reign of Dan Ashworth as sporting director of Manchester United was one that crashed and burned in a matter of months.",
      "The Englishman was a key target for Sir Jim Ratcliffe who had to wait over four months for Ashworth to officially start his role due to being put on gardening leave by former club Newcastle United.",
      "It was on July 1st last year that Ashworth officially joined the Red Devils and quickly got to work on a significant recruitment drive for then-boss Erik ten Hag following United's FA Cup final triumph over Manchester City.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Ashworth was targeting four players in particular, and managed to sign three of them last summer – except for Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite. United saw a £35m bid rejected for him a year ago, and ultimately moved on to other options.",
      "One of the players was well-known by Ten Hag, who was keen on reuniting with Matthijs De Ligt, with United forking out £42million to sign the former Ajax man from Bayern Munich.",
      "In an attempt to provide Rasmus Hojlund with some support at the other end of the pitch, Ashworth triggered Joshua Zirkzee's £34m release clause from Bologna after the Dutchman had helped the club clinch Champions League football for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "Keen to welcome a new defensive midfielder – with Casemiro not showing the same impact he had made at Real Madrid at the time – a move for Manuel Ugarte was commissioned with Paris Saint-Germain willing to let the Uruguayan leave after just one season.",
      "A bid of £40m was enough to secure the signature of the ex-Sporting CP star who ended up playing under Ruben Amorim once again following the Portuguese boss' appointment as Ten Hag's replacement last November.",
      "However, Ashworth never got to see the fruits – or lack-there-of – of his labour after mutually agreeing to leave United in December, just a month after Amorim's arrival. Over four months of the season had already gone by upon Ashworth's departure and the performances of those three players left a lot to be desired.",
      "Despite De Ligt cultivating an impressive reputation in Europe since his teenage years, he struggled heavily in his first few months in Manchester and could not look settled in the centre of defence.",
      "While United went on to continue having a dour season under Amorim, the Dutchman became more comfortable in defence and has since led United fans to hope he remains a steadfast member of their backline for years to come.",
      "The same can't be said for Joshua Zirkzee, whose presence in the squad still has United targeting a striker to aid in their goalscoring woes – a position the ex-Bayern Munich forward was supposed to fill.",
      "The 24-year-old scored just seven goals in 49 games across all competitions, with just three coming in the Premier League. His future at the club could come into play should Amorim manage to lure former Sporting hitman Viktor Gyokeres to the club, although he is subject to strong interest from Arsenal. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa is also on United's radar.",
      "In the case of Ugarte, the 24-year-old is adept at tackling and winning back possession such are the qualities of a defensive midfielder. However, he was criticised last season for his lack of progressive play with fans claiming his passing and athleticism are seriously lacking.",
      "Amorim has a mighty job on his hands ahead of the 2025/26 season, and it remains to be seen just how much of a role these three players will play in the coming years at United.",
      "It looks as though there will be little chance of completing Ashworth's quartet any time soon, too. Branthwaite has now penned a new contract with Everton under former United boss David Moyes. The England international – now reportedly valued around the £70m mark – signed a new five-year deal earlier this week."

      "If you want proof that time flies, David de Gea left Manchester United two years ago.",
      "De Gea departed upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 and, after spending the entirety of the next season as a free agent, he signed for Fiorentina in August 2024.",
      "Many felt the Spaniard going a year without a club was vindication of the decision to allow him to leave. De Gea made high-profile mistakes toward the end of his time in Manchester and United believed they needed to evolve. Andre Onana was identified as the ideal successor and signed from Inter Milan.",
      "Two years later, De Gea will return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The 34-year-old recently signed a one-year contract extension with Fiorentina and is expected to start against United next month.",
      "De Gea will be looking forward to his return to Manchester. He regularly engages with former teammates on social media and replies to videos of his best saves during his time at United.",
      "The goalkeeper's legacy is fascinating to analyse ahead of his first appearance at Old Trafford.",
      "For a long time, De Gea was the best goalkeeper in the world, although his time at United didn't end on a positive note and recency bias affected how some supporters remember him.",
      "De Gea's final season was pretty quirky, given he made some game-deciding saves and kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League, but became a target for opponents when the ball was at his feet.",
      "His performance against Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-finals was the beginning of the end. De Gea conceded within 10 minutes, playing a pass short when he should have gone long, and his second error was embarrassing.",
      "De Gea misjudged Sevilla's speculative punt forward and seemed to forget how to kick a ball, botching the clearance, which allowed Youssef En-Nesyri to slot into an open goal to make it 3-0.",
      "United were second best in every area at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium on that evening, but De Gea made the headlines and even newspapers in his homeland slammed his display.",
      "Sevilla was the straw that broke the camel's back regarding De Gea's future at United, and then the FA Cup final happened and Ilkay Gundogan scored within 13 seconds at Wembley.",
      "After those two episodes on the big stage, Erik ten Hag had a straightforward decision to make.",
      "\"I just wanted to send this farewell message to all Manchester United supporters,\" De Gea wrote when his exit was confirmed.",
      "\"I would like to express my unwavering gratitude and appreciation for the love from the last 12 years. We've achieved a lot since my dear Sir Alex Ferguson brought me to this club.",
      "\"I took incredible pride every time I pulled on this shirt, to lead the team, to represent this institution, the biggest club in the world was an honour only bestowed upon a few lucky footballers.",
      "\"It's been an unforgettable and successful period since I came here. I didn't think from leaving Madrid as a young boy we would achieve what we did together.",
      "\"Now, it's the right time to undertake a new challenge, to push myself again in new surroundings. Manchester will always be in my heart, Manchester has shaped me and will never leave me. We've seen it all.\"",
      "De Gea left behind an outstanding record, having made 545 appearances for United and been part of the team that won the 2012/13 Premier League title with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge.",
      "The goalkeeper also won the FA Cup in 2016, the Carabao Cup in 2017 and 2023, as well as the Europa League in 2017. De Gea is seventh on the club's all-time appearance list.",
      "Bruno Fernandes recently won the Sir Matt Busby award for a fourth time, meaning the midfielder joined De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to pick up the prize on four occasions.",
      "De Gea faced intense scrutiny at the end of his time in Manchester, but he will be remembered among the greatest United goalkeepers, and some will regard him as the greatest.",
      "Peter Schmeichel probably has that status, although there is no denying De Gea is a modern-day legend and he served United for long enough to deserve a testimonial at Old Trafford.",
      "Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick were all given testimonials in appreciation of their service and De Gea should be given the same.",
      "De Gea has not spoken about his departure from United and there is a feeling that the circumstances of his exit don't sit well with him. But the two figures who were responsible, Ten Hag and John Murtough, have moved on and he would likely accept a testimonial when he decides to hang up his gloves.",
      "For now, De Gea will have to settle for returning to Old Trafford for Fiorentina's pre-season friendly.",
      "He will receive a brilliant reception and it's great to see him enjoying his football again."

      "Manchester United were ostensibly on the up under Erik ten Hag, ending their trophy drought in the Dutchman's first year at the helm and securing a third-place finish in the Premier League. Champions League football was set to return to Old Trafford and there was reason for optimism.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester City were sitting pretty as the kings of England and Europe, with the world crown soon set to follow. A lot has changed since then.",

      "And then there's United. 15th in the Premier League last season, no European football to look forward and a mishmash of a squad that needs gutting.",
      "The summer transfer window represents a crucial time for two sides looking to send a message to the rest of the Premier League. Outgoings will be as important as incomings, and the two clubs may find themselves in direct competition.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish both enjoyed superb 2022/23 seasons, with the former bagging the first 30-goal haul of his career and Grealish playing a vital role in City's historical treble. Their stock has fallen dramatically since then and both could be on the move this summer.",
      "Rashford has told United he wants to leave and City are searching for a buyer for Grealish. While Rashford and Grealish are two very different players, both forwards will command hefty wages and their respective clubs won't be willing to let them leave for pennies - United want £40m for Rashford and that same figure is claimed to be enough to sign Grealish this summer.",
      "Moving them on isn't going to be easy, and the task will only be made tougher by a club on the other side of the city looking to sell a player who will undoubtedly be linked with the same clubs.",
      "Few could have envisioned Rashford and Grealish being sold a few years ago. Both players needs to find new clubs this summer, but that's easier said than done."

      "“You would anticipate his wage demands would be pretty high,” he said via Tottenham News.",
      "“If you look at that in the context of Spurs, that’s not necessarily an issue for them on a wages turnover position, because theirs has historically been lower than 50 per cent in the last few seasons.",
      "“So, if you look at wages to turn over headroom, and obviously wrapping that up into UEFA and squad cost, it’s plausible.",
      "“The bigger question is, again with Spurs, how much are his wage demands, what does he want, and you’ve got to factor that into the long-term contract position before you’ve even engaged on a fee.",
      "“It’s one of those where Spurs could afford it in the long-term, and they’re going to have Champions League money as well to boost that in the season that we’re coming into, but it’s whether or not they really want to outlay a significant amount of wages on that kind of player, and then the fee over the top.”",

      "At the end of the 2024/2025 campaign, Xabi Alonso left the club to join Real Madrid as their new head coach and Ten Hag was appointed as his successor. Now, as the preparations start to ramp up for the new season, it appears that Kovar will, once again, be sold by the Dutchman.",

However, speaking to Czech outlet Sport in 2024, the goalkeeper insisted that there'd been no talk around a return to Old Trafford.",
      "\"No, I have not. It's important for me to start playing regularly and establish a position in Leverkusen,\" Kovar said when asked if United had approached him regarding a return.",

      "The 26-year-old is expected to depart Napoli this summer and he has featured on United's watchlist previously. However, speaking to Betway, journalist Ben Jacobs claimed that there is nothing concrete linking Osimhen with the Reds at this stage.",
      "But, should Osimhen move to Al Hilal, there could be a possibility for Mitrovic to join United. It is claimed by Jacobs that United had enquired about signing the 30-year-old on loan if Osimhen was to arrive in Saudi Arabia prior to the Club World Cup.",
      "While Osimhen rejected Al Hilal's approach at that time, there remains a possibility that the Nigerian could sign later in the summer transfer window. Therefore, the move for Mitrovic could still come to fruition.",
      "The Serbian scored an impressive 28 goals in the Middle East last season and comes with pedigree in the Premier League. In his last season in the Premier League top flight in 2022/23, Mitrovic bagged 14 goals in 24 appearances for Fulham.",
      "Before that, the bulk of his goals have come in the Championship so his arrival would represent a gamble from the Reds. There are also concerns as to whether United would be willing to match his considerable wage he is receiving at Al Hilal.",

However, the club's failure to win the Europa League ensured no European football this coming season and, in turn, appeared to have hindered their ability to sign the Sweden international.",

      "Jacobs says that Amorim's ideal plan would be to sign the striker he unearthed from Coventry City. Previously, it has been understood that United would need to sell players in order to fund a swoop for Gyokeres this summer.",
      "While that is still the case, the new financial year means that this is less of a priority - for now. Jacobs claims that while United would need to sell at least two of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, that could be done after Gyokeres joins to balance up the books.",

      "You don't have to be a fortune teller to predict how Onana's season will unfold. He will deliver a few excellent performances, but the inevitable mistakes will creep in sooner rather than later.",

      "That will have to be put on the back burner for now, though. United are prioritising other positions in the summer transfer window and Onana is expected to play a third season for the club.",

That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",

      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",

      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",

      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",

      "Nelson, having missed half of the campaign with a hamstring injury, only made 11 Premier League appearances for the Cottagers in 24/25 and desperately needs to get his career back on track. A return to Europe is perhaps the next step, though a move to Birmingham, who should be a serious title contender, to play against weaker opposition could do the 25-year-old’s confidence the world of good.",

      "Aston Villa: Ross Barkley\nThe former England international was an astute signing for the Villans after his return to prominence at relegated Luton Town, as he added necessary competition to Unai Emery’s squad ahead of their Champions League campaign.",
      "The 31-year-old is hardly indispensable after only making three Premier League starts in 2024/25. He is also entering the stage of his career when money talks with his next move, and he would be a leading star for Birmingham or Wrexham.",

      "These were the words of Emmanuel Petit on Sterling in April this year.

      "Marcus Rashford is not wanted by Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim and has plenty of interest from abroad, but that salary of his is proving to be quite the hurdle.",
      "Where will Rashford go? Is staying at United completely off the table? Will he flee the country for a fresh start? It’s a World Cup year, making this summer absolutely crucial. We’ve ranked his 10 most realistic transfer options in what promises to be a long, long window.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester United\nStaying at Old Trafford seems to be the most unlikely scenario for Rashford. He definitely has the ability to come Back Stronger, but it all comes down to Ruben Amorim and whether or not he wants to welcome back a player he publicly said he doesn’t want.",
      "There really does feel like no way back for Rashford at Manchester United, especially after Matheus Cunha took the No.10 shirt, but assuming it becomes an option, let’s weigh up the pros and cons.",
      "Getting the negative stuff out of the way first, it’s not likely that Rashford fits into Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system. He doesn’t really have the intelligence or playmaking ability to be a ‘wide 10’, and he’s not an out-and-out centre-forward. Or a wing-back. Then there’s the dressing-room precedent. Amorim put his big balls on the table with his decision to ostracise Rashford, and putting water under the bridge makes him look weak. His reasons for binning Rashford reportedly included his poor work ethic, and if he genuinely doesn’t work hard, why would they want to keep him?",
      "Well, s**t, that was a pretty compelling argument for selling him, if I do say so myself. But, err, he is good at football or something. When he can be arsed. Come on, Ruben – keep him, fella. Just for the vibes.",
      "",
      "9) Newcastle United\nThis move is increasingly unlikely after Newcastle bid £55million for Nottingham Forest winger Anthony Elanga, but one attacking sale can change things — and Eddie Howe still doesn’t have an adequate back-up for Alexander Isak. If he gets injured, the Magpies are in big trouble. Callum Wilson can no longer be relied on even if he signs a contract extension.",
      "Rashford’s ability to play anywhere in attack makes him an appealing target. The big issue — and this will be a theme here — is his current salary and unwillingness to accept a lower wage.",
      "Newcastle’s wage structure will not be broken for Rashford. They’re scared to do it for Isak, and he’s their best player since Alan Shearer. Breaking the bank for them — despite their billions — is paying Isak £200,000 a week. Amazingly, that would be a significant pay cut for Rashford.",
      "",
      "8) Saudi Arabia\nThe last resort. It’s hard to see Rashford giving up on elite football entirely at 27, but if the money’s right and no one else is biting…",
      "MORE RASHFORD FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Trent ‘defensively solid’? Really? Plus Rashford SHOCK and Boxing Day\n👉 Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd, Man City outcasts and Spurs captain Son…\n👉 Aston Villa and Brighton duos in 10 Premier League loanees ready to shine in 2025/26",
      "",
      "7) Turkey\nSee: Saudi Arabia. But Turkey is slightly more ambitious from a footballing perspective. If he still vaguely cares about the sport, this is the better option. Not by much, mind.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea\nSurely not, right? Well…this is Chelsea after all. They remain linked with Mohammed Kudus and Alejandro Garnacho despite signing Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Jamie Gittens, so Rashford shouldn’t be completely ruled out.",
      "Mykhaylo Mudryk’s future remains uncertain, Jadon Sancho hasn’t been signed permanently, and Noni Madueke is an Arsenal target. There’s definitely a chance. If there’s one team that loves a dysfunctional forward, it’s Chelsea.",
      "",
      "5) Aston Villa\nIn truth, a loan to Villa for a full season after six months in 2024/25 is more likely than a permanent transfer. It all comes down to Rashford’s current salary and his desire to continue earning a frankly absurd weekly wage of at least £315,000.",
      "We literally saw the upsides of this move play out last season when he enjoyed playing football again under Unai Emery. Rashford is clearly a player the Spaniard likes, and the managerial expert knows how to get a tune out of him.",
      "Paying £40million and then a colossal wage is just not an option for the Villans. That’s not even an unreasonable transfer fee to demand, but coupled with his salary, there has to be some serious wiggle room.",
      "Or United could cover a percentage of Rashford’s salary. At this stage, they just need him sold.",
      "",
      "4) Juventus or Napoli\nTwo for the price of one here, with Italian giants Juventus and Napoli both in contention.",
      "Signing an overpaid United outcast would be pretty on-brand for Juventus, who currently have two very impressive young wingers in Kenan Yildiz and Francisco Conceicao, and recently added Nico Gonzalez.",
      "Antonio Conte’s side, meanwhile, are still looking for a replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. A move abroad is surely the most likely outcome for Rashford this summer. The new environment would do him a world of good, and playing for one of Europe’s elite in the Champions League would do his England prospects no harm.",
      "Serie A clubs are notoriously stingy, which makes his wage demands a huge stumbling block. If playing in Italy really appeals to Rashford, he could take a pay cut. That’s probably wishful thinking, but the footballing logic checks out.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal\nMikel Arteta wants a new left winger, with an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli one of the ingredients required to win a first Premier League title in over two decades.",
      "Is Rashford the answer? Is he a clear upgrade on the Brazilian? We’re not entirely convinced, but at his best, he probably is. The problem is neither seems likely to hit those 2022/23 peaks again.",
      "Arsenal’s clear desire to improve in the position that Rashford plays is a big reason for their high placement in this ranking. However, they are definitely focusing on different targets.",
      "Real Madrid’s Rodrygo is reportedly the ‘dream’, while Rafael Leao, Anthony Gordon and Nico Williams are likely higher in Arteta’s and sporting director Andrea Berta’s thinking.",
      "",
      "2) Barcelona\nHansi Flick’s side would be top if it wasn’t for their financial situation. They’ve had to move on from Nico Williams due to registration issues, though his Athletic Bilbao contract extension also suggests he wanted his future sorted early.",
      "This move is perfect. Flick’s front three have very little defensive responsibility and lots of freedom to express themselves. Lamine Yamal is a special boy and would shine under any manager (surely), but he’s struck gold having the German as a head coach. Raphinha, meanwhile, has been in genuine Ballon d’Or form under Flick.",
      "Barcelona are not a difficult team to be brilliant in, and in a World Cup year, that’s pretty ideal for Rashford. United want to sell, but this one could drag out.",
      "",
      "1) Bayern Munich\nThe aforementioned Williams is now off the table and Liverpool don’t want to sell Luis Diaz, so Bayern are seriously considering signing Rashford from the Red Devils.",
      "They are surely able to afford Rashford’s wages, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will agree to his demands. It’s all about what Rashford is worth to them — and given the two years he’s had, that is definitely not over £300k a week.",
      "AC Milan’s Rafael Leao is a more glamorous and realistic target — and he’s better — but you get the feeling that Bayern are properly sniffing around Rashford. Their desperation to sign a left winger is clear as day, and Rashford would absolutely thrive in the Bundesliga against the naive high lines of your Heidenheims and Werder Bremens.",

      "Ruben Amorim lost the Europa League final to a historically bad Tottenham side and himself said he was willing to leave “without conversation or compensation” if he was not wanted by Manchester United.",
      "In truth he will surely be given a summer to build a squad closer to something that suits his formation.",
      "Still, though, just for fun: who could take over at Manchester United? We have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "9=) Zinedine Zidane\nPeople keep trying to make Zinedine Zidane to United happen. It’s not going to happen.",
      "",
      "9=) Roberto De Zerbi\nThe current Marseille manager will remain high on any list of possible managers for any big Premier League club because he ‘knows the league’, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "6=) Unai Emery\nMight be the one high-profile Premier League manager for whom the Man United job holds more appeal than Man City. He’s already had one crack at replacing a Big Six legend whose fingerprints are all over the club. At least with United he’s a good few steps removed from all that. But swapping what he’s got going at Villa for United would still be a questionable move.",
      "",
      "6=) Marco Silva\nHas done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should, they definitely won’t.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) Kieran McKenna\nHis agent played a blinder as reported interest from Manchester United and Chelsea led to a four-year contract at Ipswich that made him one of the best-paid managers in the Premier League. But would United fans really countenance the appointment of a relegated manager?",
      "",
      "3=) Michael Carrick\nWould ‘knows the club’ trump the fact that Carrick has not long been sacked by a Championship club? It didn’t work out brilliantly for Frank Lampard at Chelsea, but it remains a curiously beguiling CV booster even at the very heftiest of clubs.",
      "",
      "3=) Mauricio Pochettino\nChelsea chose the path of abject stupidity and it appeared to leave the path clear for United to pounce on a manager they had coveted back in his Tottenham days. They decided to eschew that option in favour of sticking with what’s been working so very well for them.",
      "Any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until next summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "2) Gareth Southgate\nVery strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "1) Oliver Glasner\nThat FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has taken the Austrian high up all the lists, and now right to the very top of the silliest of all of them now Spurs are off the table for at least the next few months.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has had ‘no contact’ with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim since their falling out, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is off after Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho decided to pull the plug on the deal.",
      "Mainoo is so much more than ‘pure profit’ and the very idea of selling him is an indictment of Premier League profit and sustainability rules.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer.",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £61.7m\nThe Black Cats made Noah Sadiki their third summer signing and are far from finished following promotion to the Premier League.",
      "",
      "8) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "6) Atalanta – £68m\nIvan Juric has somehow landed the Atalanta job and has brought Kamaldeen Sulemana with him from Southampton.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton – £69m\nMaxim De Cuyper has propelled the Seagulls into the top five biggest spenders.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £101.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £202.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m."

      "Marcus Rashford’s hopes of a Barcelona move have received a boost, while Arsenal are intensifying their efforts to sign a Chelsea forward…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal is keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Tino Livramento – Newcastle to Manchester City\nAn £80m offer from City has been reported, and they do need a new right-back, even if Matheus Nunes is improving there.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",

      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. And Berta, evidently, hasn’t sufficiently seduced the striker’s agents. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nA re-entry into the top 20, carried on the back of Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao. Williams seemed set for Barca but despite appearances, the Catalans are clearly still dropping balls while juggling their finances. Barca like Luis Diaz but Liverpool are either keen to keep the Colombian or they will only sell for money Barca don’t have. Which takes them back to Rashford, who will likely have to wait until late in the window by which time United will have to accept the only way to get rid is another loan.",
      "",
      "13) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo. But Rodrygo might be too pricey; Williams seems to be staying in Bilbao; and Eze could be signed separately. Romano reckons more talks have taken place, but seemingly not between the clubs.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London almost a fortnight ago to complete his move, but if we know anything about Arsenal this summer, it’s that they won’t be rushed."

      "This is according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim that they want Rashford, Luis Diaz and Denzel Dumfries.",
      "‘After seeing their star signing frustrated with Nico Williams ‘ renewal at Athletic Club , FC Barcelona has completely redesigned its roadmap. The Blaugrana have quickly defined a new trio of clear targets for this transfer window: Denzel Dumfries, Luis Díaz, and Marcus Rashford .",

      "Apparently there are 20 teams in the Premier League. Who knew? And if that’s true, we should probably go ahead and reassign the best of the rest to the Big Six. And Newcastle United; they’re filthy rich and qualified for the Champions League, so we know about them.",
      "",
      "Marc Guehi to Liverpool\nPoor Crystal Palace. This is what happens when you recruit wisely: you eventually get all the nice things ripped away from you.",
      "Their first player to go is their captain, who’s been strongly linked with Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United, and Arsenal. With just one year left on Guehi’s Palace contract, a summer sale looks pretty likely.",
      "The FA Cup winners might believe holding on to Guehi and losing him on a free transfer is the way to go, but we’re not so sure. Either way, Sporting CP defender Ousmane Diomande has been mooted as the England international’s replacement, which is very smart business, assuming they can pull it off.",
      "Liverpool’s interest is strong amid uncertainty over Ibrahima Konate’s long-term future, and Guehi playing alongside Virgil van Dijk is a frightening prospect for the Reds’ Premier League rivals. They’d form a perfect mix of aggression, reading of the game, and composure on and off the ball.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins to Manchester United\nFor a while, it looked like Watkins to Arsenal was inevitable. But now the Gunners are prioritising Viktor Gyokeres, who has been targeted by United as well. This means the Red Devils are considering the England striker, and even though he’s at an age (29) where big clubs might ignore his talent, their interest makes perfect sense.",
      "He’s yet to score fewer than 11 goals in a Premier League season and also provides a terrific number of assists for a centre-forward: eight last season after a league-high 15 in 2023/24, and six on top of 15 goals the year before.",
      "Scoring 75 goals in 184 Premier League appearances is a fantastic record for an English striker unfortunate to be playing in the same era as Harry Kane.",
      "Aston Villa are a fantastic club and in a much better state than Manchester United, but This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About Here. Watkins deserves to make that move, join the 100 club and hopefully win some trophies (something he’s still wanting to do so). Bless him.",
      "Oh, and not to mention that he would make United so, so much better.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze to Arsenal\nThe odds of this transfer happening are getting shorter by the day, and what a signing it would be for Arsenal. Eze is a delightful, likeable footballer, which would make a move to the Emirates hard to stomach for many people. He and Bukayo Saka aren’t enough to pass the Gunners off as likeable for rival fans while Mikel Arteta is in charge.",
      "Crystal Palace losing their best player and captain in the same summer would be disastrous, but given its likelihood they will have a plan in place, and if a club is capable of adapting to such drastic changes it’s them. They’ll never find themselves in relegation trouble — especially with Oliver Glasner in charge — and have the eye for recruitment that will help fans sleep easily.",
      "Eze would add a lot to an Arsenal side that struggled with their creativity last term. Martin Odegaard was not himself and there was nobody there to pick up the slack, playmaking-wise. Declan Rice did everything he could, but it was not enough with his fellow midfielders and attackers underperforming.",
      "The Palace star is pretty good at taking set-pieces as well. That’s the real reason Arteta wants him.",
      "MORE TRANSFER FEATURES ON F365\n👉 Isak to Liverpool? Arsenal land Rodrygo but Gyokeres hijacked? Dream signings for every PL club\n👉 Leeds given £256.5m challenge by most expensive XI signed by promoted clubs\n👉 Chelsea stride away in Premier League net spend table over the last five years",
      "",
      "Murillo to Chelsea\nThe 22-year-old Brazilian ticks plenty of boxes: left-footed, strong in duels, comfortable progressing the ball out from the back, and still young enough to develop further. He’s exactly the kind of player Chelsea have been all over in recent years.",
      "Murillo was one of Nottingham Forest’s standouts in a fantastic 2024/25 season and is a clear upgrade on some of Chelsea’s centre-back signings in the Todd Boehly era. Two left-footed centre-backs might not be the most traditional pairing — and that’s what we’d see at Stamford Bridge, with Levi Colwill an undisputed starter for years to come — but they’d form one of the best partnerships in the Premier League, with a combined age of just 44.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus to Newcastle United\nAnother pretty realistic transfer, Kudus was poor in 2024/25, but then so was the entire West Ham team.",
      "It seems to be between Spurs and Newcastle for the Ghanaian’s signature and while last season was disappointing, his campaign the year before will fill interested clubs with confidence that he’s worth splashing the cash on.",
      "Having assigned Spurs a different player, we’ve given the edge to the Magpies who are, in truth, much more desperate for a player like Kudus.",
      "Eddie Howe needs a new right-winger, even after the incredibly productive season Jacob Murphy just had, which is still baffling. Kudus would be an upgrade and is only 25 years old.",
      "",
      "Morgan Rogers to Liverpool\nThis would be a fantastic move for Liverpool and Rogers, whose ability and potential deserve to be recognised at one of the best and biggest clubs in Europe. To quote Harry Redknapp: “He will go right to the very top.”",
      "He possesses the attributes modern managers love in an attacking midfielder. He has a lovely blend of strength and pace that makes him an elite ball-carrier with end-product.",
      "Capable of playing in the No.10 role and on either wing, Rogers would be an asset for any of last season’s top four and there’s no doubt he’d massively contribute towards a title push for any of those clubs.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White to Manchester City\nThere was talk not so long ago of City targeting Florian Wirtz or Gibbs-White as their Kevin De Bruyne replacement. They’ve since signed Rayan Cherki, Wirtz joined Liverpool in June, and Gibbs-White remains a Nottingham Forest player.",
      "Cherki’s arrival from Lyon, along with the signing of Dutch international Tijjani Reijnders, doesn’t mean City are done recruiting creative midfielders. When the initial interest in Wirtz and Gibbs-White was reported, it was said they could sign both. Now, they could well end up with neither — but Cherki is a shrewd addition for £34million.",
      "The England international would cost a fair whack, and even with Forest in Europe, you’d imagine he’d quite fancy to play under Pep Guardiola. Like Rogers, he’s capable of playing as a No.10, a little deeper, or on either wing. He’d be a superb signing.",
      "",
      "Yoane Wissa to Tottenham Hotspur\nIf you’re wondering, Bryan Mbeumo has been ignored because he’s pretty nailed on to go to Manchester United. Although Mbeumo being the player United finally decided to stand firm over and refuse to meet a club’s demands for would be very on brand. He’s actually worth the money, lads. Unlike Mason Mount with a year left on his Chelsea contract, and Antony — who they could’ve signed for half the price a month before paying £80m to Ajax.",
      "Anyway, we digress. New Spurs boss Thomas Frank looks set to miss out on Mbeumo, so could turn his attention to another former Brentford player. Wissa scored an outstanding 19 goals in the Premier League last season and is out of contract next year, so the Bees will be open to selling for the right price.",
      "With Dominic Solanke struggling with injuries, Wissa would be a very savvy addition.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘turn to’ a new striker target, but this potential deal hinges on one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "An ex-Aston Villa striker has labelled Ollie Watkins’ potential move to Man Utd as a step ‘backwards’, saying ‘Villa are playing in Europe, Utd aren’t.’",
      "Arsenal have allowed Takehiro Tomiyasu to leave the club after his deal at the Emirates Stadium was ‘terminated on mutual consent’.",
      "Arsenal are preparing a bid for Crystal Palace midfielder Eberechi Eze, with the England international open to a transfer after talks with the Gunners.",
      "Arsenal could ‘wrap up’ a deal for a ‘desperate’ star ‘in the next hour’ as Andrea Berta has been told how he can reduce the transfer fee.",
      "Premier League runners-up Arsenal are ‘well advanced’ in negotiations to land Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze this summer, according to reports."

      "Let’s not beat around the bush: Fabrizio Romano is a character. Love him or hate him, we can’t live without him.",
      "This is a man who screenshot Lamine Yamal’s Instagram story after 18 seconds to post it on his X account. He’s a mouthpiece for agents and has an unprecedented amount of power for a transfer journalist. His word is gospel to so many people, and that fame and reliability make him a perfect tool for players and their representatives trying to engineer a move.",
      "If he posted on X ‘Young talent Jason Soutar is being watched by several top clubs after Dundee contract expiry’, I’d probably be a professional footballer within a week.",
      "He’s got his favourites, too — posting about the same players countless times. Jonathan David instantly comes to mind, and his transfer to Juventus has inspired us to look at some deals Romano has essentially manifested or helped materialise through sheer online presence.",
      "Jonathan David to Juventus\nFabrizio Romano can finally sleep after years of trying to get Jonathan David out of Lille. The Canadian striker got the ‘Here we go’ for a move to Juventus. No fee involved after his Lille contract expired.",
      "David had been perpetually linked with the Premier League, thanks in large part to the transfer guru, who’s been championing his client favourite player for years. He never got his England move but joins a proper European giant in Juve, back to doing what they do best: signing elite talent for free.",
      "MORE: Eight stars *definitely* in Fabrizio Romano’s contact book",
      "",
      "Milos Kerkez to Liverpool\nSticking with summer 2025 and sagas fresh in the mind, Romano was all over Kerkez as he sparkled for Bournemouth, linking him to Manchester United and Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool got their man after United opted for Patrick Dorgu in January. Let’s be honest, picking between the actual Premier League champions and the shambles that is Manchester United wasn’t a hard call.",
      "Romano introduced many of us to Kerkez back in April 2023, when Benfica were keen. It then looked like Lazio, until Bournemouth underlined the power of the Premier League by swooping in and hijacking the deal.",
      "After a brilliant debut season, Romano went into endorsement overdrive — reporting that United “will bring in a new left-back for sure this summer”. Are we allowing Noussair Mazraoui? If not, he was wrong…the FRAUD.",
      "Any goal involvement became an excuse for Romano to boost the Kerkez hype, and he ultimately earned his move to Liverpool. Absolutely deserved, for what it’s worth.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro to Chelsea\nYou might’ve forgotten this, but Romano once gave a ‘Here we go’ for Pedro joining Newcastle United from Watford. What. A FRAUD.",
      "Pedro went to Brighton instead. Newcastle wanted him again this summer. Now he’s at Chelsea.",
      "Romano loves a Brazilian (not that kind) — Joao Pedro, Vitor Roque, Casemiro, Andre, Raphinha. We stopped paying attention to what he was saying about Pedro long ago. He could’ve said ‘Here we go’ to a move to Bikini Bottom and we’d have just shrugged.",
      "",
      "Aurelien Tchouameni to Real Madrid\nBack in 2022, Tchouameni was hot property after bossing Ligue 1 for Monaco. But it was always Real Madrid — as Romano was very keen to tell us. Often.",
      "Romano says Klopp “called” Tchouameni. PSG “made the best proposal”. But nope, the “player only wanted Madrid”. Which we knew. Because he said it 147 times.",
      "Romano’s first post about the Frenchman even ruled out Man United a year early. ‘Manchester United are currently not working to sign Tchouameni… no contacts as of now,’ he tweeted. UTDTrey top of the replies: ‘Don’t know who he is anyway.’ United fans and their transfer team summed up perfectly.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool\nSurprisingly, Romano didn’t tweet about Frimpong until he was at Leverkusen. Nothing from the Celtic days. Shameful.",
      "Naturally, United were chucked into the mix as Frimpong shone, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich also sniffing around. Romano dropped an exclusive about a new contract, was one of the first to reveal his £34m release clause, and would occasionally repeat the same nothing update just to keep things warm. Classic Fabrizio. We do love you, you know?",
      "A day after saying Frimpong was “one to watch this summer”, Romano reported Liverpool’s interest as a potential Trent Alexander-Arnold replacement. Liverpool being Liverpool, they signed him in four days flat.",
      "",
      "Casemiro to Manchester United\nUnited wanted De Jong. De Jong wanted anything but United. Enter Casemiro.",
      "Romano was on this the second it was viable. Updates came thick and fast as he and United pushed to get it over the line. United got their man. It looked clever for a year, which is decent for them.",
      "",
      "Raphinha to Barcelona\nWhat a saga. Romano wasn’t alone — Matt Law and David Ornstein were in there too — but Romano kept bringing it back to Barca, saying they were Raphinha’s “dream club” and that personal terms were already sorted.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds agreed a fee. Barca had no money. But Romano said they’d “try until the end”, and they did. And they won.",
      "He finally dropped the ‘Here we go’ saying Raphinha “only wanted Barca since February”. Brother, we know. You told us 176 times.",
      "",
      "Mykhaylo Mudryk to Chelsea\nThis saga — January 2023’s finest. The only reason to get up in the morning.",
      "Mudryk wanted Arsenal. Arsenal wanted Mudryk. But Arsenal also wanted to haggle. Chelsea said “money?” and Shakhtar said “yes, please”.",
      "Romano was at his most plugged-in here — borderline on Chelsea’s payroll. Either that, or Todd Boehly was just following Romano’s feed and bidding for whoever Arsenal fancied.",
      "",
      "Andre Onana to Inter\nWhile Onana was dealing with a doping ban, Romano told us he was Inter-bound in a year. Guess what? He was.",
      "Lyon fell through, Arsenal were curious, Inter waited. Romano was patient. Inter got their man. United eventually took the bait. Big mistake.",

So while Arsenal might hope or expect to see a lovely central midfielder or even, bless, their hearts, an actual centre-forward arrive through the training ground doors, pure logic and playing the odds tells us it’s far more likely to be a goalkeeper.",
      "Even though Arsenal already have a very good goalkeeper and have already signed another goalkeeper this summer. That just shows how much they like signing goalkeepers. Even if you count Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus as centre-forwards, then Arteta has still signed twice as many goalkeepers as centre-forwards as Arsenal manager.",
      "Again, using nothing but the very purest and definitely non-mental of logic, that means they MUST sign one more goalkeeper this summer if they wish to procure one number nine. It’s very simple.",
      "Having established that Lille are Arsenal’s favourite club to buy from, how about this for a possible solution to a goalkeeper problem that doesn’t actually exist at the Emirates? Bring back Vito Mannone.",

      "But it is a very on-brand Manchester United signing for so many reasons. Buying a player from the manager’s former club? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker? Tick. Spending huge money on a striker who’s never actually done the business in a top league before? Tick.",

      "Lyon are already a club Spurs like to work with, presumably because back when Jean-Michel Aulas was in charge there was a healthy mutual respect between him and Daniel Levy as the transfer game’s two most notoriously difficult bastards. It genuinely is a wonder they ever managed to get a deal done, but we suspect every time they each walked away certain they’d pulled the other’s pants down.",

Even if sometimes they can only borrow them for a bit.",
      "Villa are the social-media influencer trying to project an image of extreme wealth that doesn’t quite match the reality, in a way.",

      "Villa’s foundations may be slightly shaky, but they do remain an ideal ‘next step’ kind of club for players of Branthwaite’s ilk. Big enough and successful enough to definitely not be a sideways step, but without the laser focus and goldfish bowl existence and instant rushes to judgement that come by jumping straight to even loftier ground.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",

      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",

      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
