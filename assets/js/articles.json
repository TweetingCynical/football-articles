      "Niall Horan went into business with Fenway Sports Group last year – and now he is back at Anfield to watch Liverpool take on Manchester United. Arne Slot’s side are looking to get their season back on track after suffering three defeats in the space of a week before the international break.",
      "And Horan is watching the action from the stands at Anfield, along with Ryder Cup hero, Ludvig Aberg. It is the first time the One Direction star has been back at the home of the Premier League champions since Liverpool thrashed United 7-0 two years ago.",
      "“This is alright, isn’t it? Wow! The last time I was here it was 7-0,” he said in a clip posted on Liverpool’s X page. But when asked for a prediction, Horan replied “I don’t want to say anything. I refuse to speak.”",
      "Horan teamed up with FSG last year when the group purchased a franchise in the Technology Golf League. The league is spearheaded by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and the franchise is named Boston Common Golf.",
      "Speaking about the deal last year, the 32-year-old said: “Golf has been a lifelong passion of mine and I’m thrilled to be part of this exciting new venture alongside my investment group, Greenbridge Ventures, in partnership with Fenway Sports Group and Rory, who has been a long-time friend.",
      "“I can’t wait to experience team golf in this unique format that merges technology with green grass play.",
      "“Being able to combine my love for the game and my friendship with Rory into a relationship that helps launch a new concept in golf is truly special.",
      "“It’s a fantastic opportunity and I think this new league backed by both Tiger Woods and Rory and team will bring a fresh perspective to the sport I adore.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the game, Jamie Carragher said: \"We’re at the stage now where Liverpool don’t just have to win. But show us why you’re champions.",
      "\"They’re the best team in the league last season, spent a whole load of money, this is the perfect opportunity to forget what happened in the last three games.\"",
      "Before he added: \"I think the results we’ve seen Liverpool have in the last week, at times you can say they were unlucky – they lost three games of those by one goal with two of them in the last minute.",
      "“But it does feel with those results and the one in the Community Shield, that those results have been coming.",
      "\"And I think there’s been a lingering worry for Liverpool supporters, watching them this season, that those results were round the corner.",
      "“You have to take into account what the club and those players have been through with the tragic passing of Diogo Jota, one of their mates. Of course that will take its toll, we have to remember that.\"",

      "It has been revealed why Liverpool were denied a penalty during the first half of their clash against Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. A quarter of an hour or so after Bryan Mbeumo put the visitors ahead, Arne Slot's side called for a spot-kick.",
      "Cody Gakpo cut inside off the left wing and delivered a cross into the box, but, before his pass could find its intended target, the ball struck the arm of Amad. The United winger stopped the ball from heading down the corridor of uncertainty, and it was gathered by Senne Lammens.",
      "The Liverpool players immediately called for a penalty, throwing their arms up in the air in protest. Meanwhile, Amad pleaded his innocence to Michael Oliver, who didn't point to the spot.",
      "The incident was briefly checked by the Video Assistant Referee, Darren England, and his assistant, James Bell, at Stockley Park, but they chose to stick with the on-field decision.",
      "An official statement from the Premier League Match Centre on X, formerly known as Twitter, reads: \"The referee’s call of no penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that Amad’s arm was in a natural and justifiable position.\"",
      "\"But it hits his other arm. He just needs to keep his arms down. He finds himself in situations he is not used to: blocking crosses.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of the highly-anticipated clash, Ruben Amorim commented on the importance of winning such a fixture. The United boss said: \"Firstly, I know what it means to everyone here.",
      "\"I try to make it the same thing because for me to win against a fourth division team is always the same responsibility. We need to address every game like it is Liverpool away so that is my focus.",
      "\"But, of course, I know that it is a different game. We have not won there for a while, so we want to change that.\"",
      "On whether last season's meeting at Anfield, which ended 2-2, offers his side great hope, Ruben added: \"It's really important and I think we are a better team this year. The most important thing and I think I have said it one million times is the way we are going to play the game.",
      "\"Then the rest, we have talent to win games, but we need to be aggressive. We need to be different to what we showed against Manchester City, for example.",
      "\"So, if we are aggressive and focused on the task, we can win any game.\"",
      "On Liverpool's run of three defeats, Amorim said: \"I am just focused on my team. Of course, we pay a lot of attention to the opponents and especially an opponent that won the league, and they are a really, really good team with a really, really good coach, but my focus is on my team.",

Sky commentator Drury explained: \"What we are getting from the Match Centre is that the referee didn't see the injury and was therefore obviously not able to stop the game.\"",

      "According to the Premier League Match Centre, Virgil van Dijk made the contact with Mac Allister, so it could've been given as a foul and VAR weren't able to intervene. Therefore, it was down to Oliver's reading of the game.",
      "Mac Allister, 26, had to wear a protective helmet after being treated for his injury. United goalscorer Mbeumo was part of the same collision but came away unscathed and was able to take advantage of sloppy Liverpool defending.",

However, after only one minute, Mbeumo slipped behind the Reds defence and slotted a finish through goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili.",

Mount then benefitted from another loose save from the Georgian goalkeeper, except his 20-yard, resultant effort was saved well by the summer arrival.",

It isn't a light switch. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently addressed Ratcliffe's remarks during his pre-match press conference on Friday, confirming he feels completely supported by United's management behind the scenes. Now, United legend Keane has offered his perspective on the matter - and confessed he remains unconvinced Amorim will receive sufficient time to orchestrate a turnaround should results and displays fail to improve.",
      "\"Whether he will get three years to play with depends how they do over the next few months. They have picked up a little bit - with the new attacking players they look more of a goal threat.",

      "He is also pleased his two sons Lorenz, 19, and Tate, 17 - who are both in the Brighton academy - would be open to speak about any issues they might have.",

      "Ferdinand said: \"The thing I say to all footballers, past and present, is we've now got the best opportunity to shape the narrative. This is the best era. My generation never had this.",

      "\"There'd have been huge headlines and people would have just gone 'what?' We'd have been hammered. But I'd love to have seen what it would have added to our teams. If we'd been able to be a bit more open and talk about these types of things, I genuinely believe it would have helped.",

      "However, he turned down lucrative offers from both Al-Hilal and Al-Ittihad last summer to remain at United. With just over 18 months remaining on his contract with United, speculation about Fernandes' future continues to swirl.",
      "Despite being a pivotal figure in the squad since his arrival from Sporting CP, uncertainty looms. German champions Bayern are eyeing up a swoop for Fernandes, with United slapping a £70 million price tag on him.",
      "United are open to entertaining bids for any player in their squad if the offer is right, following a colossal £236 million summer transfer splurge. Ruben Amorim was backed in the transfer market with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "United's final standing in the current season could significantly influence Fernandes's future. If they fail to secure a spot in the Champions League for the 2026/27 campaign, then the 31-year-old may opt to seek pastures new.",
      "Fernandes is acutely aware that his time playing at the elite level is limited and United missed out of the Champions League one. Addressing the rumours surrounding his future during the summer transfer window, Fernandes clarified his stance on a potential move away.",
      "\"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup,\" he said. \"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",
      "When asked about the possibility of leaving next summer, he added: \"That's an impossible scenario to imagine, because it's nothing that's been discussed with me.",

      "\"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year.",

      "Manchester United icon David Beckham has already made it clear that the Glazers must leave Old Trafford, having been linked with a sensational return to the club as part of a consortium from the United Arab Emirates. The Mirror revealed this morning that the 50-year-old Inter Miami chief has been approached by an unknown consortium to act as an ambassador for a potential £5billion takeover.",
      "The group is set to offer Beckham, who has a net worth of £300million, an avenue to return to his former club after being critical of the Glazer ownership in previous years. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and Ineos, acquired a minority shareholding of 27.7 per cent stake in February 2024, which has grown to nearly 29 per cent.",
      "Ratcliffe has overseen the football side of the business since taking the reins midway through last season; however, performances on the pitch have not improved. Ruben Amorim's side finished 15th in the Premier League last season, their worst ever finish in the competition, and were beaten in the Europa League final.",
      "When asked previously by The Athletic if it was time for the Glazers to depart the club, prior to Ratcliffe's minority takeover, Beckham said: \"I think so. I think it's purely because the fans want it. Once you lose the fans, especially at a club like Manchester United, it's hard to get them back.",
      "\"Obviously, [the Glazers] have achieved a lot, and financially, the fact that we're even talking about the numbers of what Manchester United will sell for shows the success they've had. But there needs to be change. We've all seen that, we all know that.\"",
      "The former United midfielder would also not rule out a future return to the club in some capacity, which would make for interesting reading should he agree to front the UAE takeover.",
      "\"I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business,\" he went on. \"But I haven't been approached and I suppose any involvement with Manchester United would mean the world to me, going forward.",
      "\"But who knows? We'll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. Hopefully, a decision gets made and if I'm involved in any way... If not, I'll be a United fan and just do what all the other fans are doing - turn up and watch our team.\"",
      "Beckham would also make it clear the club needed investment, the right people at the helm and investment into the stadium, prior to the plans for a new Old Trafford being unveiled. He said: \"Whoever is running your club, you want them to be passionate, be involved, make the right decisions, bring in the right players and invest in the club.",
      "\"Because the club does need investment, whether it's the training facility, stadium, on the field, these kinds of big things need to be made and changes do need to happen, especially when you see the likes of Man City and what they're doing.\"",
      "United's current majority owners would only consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake. That figure is more than double what the club is currently worth on the stock market, having taken over the club two decades ago in a £790m deal - and the club's current value is only around £2bn.",

      "Lammens put in a confident display as United claimed victory over Sunderland ahead of the international break and drew widespread praise for his performance. The Belgian shotstopper came away with a clean sheet as he replaced Altay Bayindir in goal.",
      "The 23-year-old, who signed in an £18.2million deal on transfer deadline day, is now in line to start against Liverpool. Amorim believes Lammens' task is only going to grow more difficult as he is exposed to more Premier League action.",
      "The United boss has emphasised the importance of Lammens continuing to strive for the very best after the early positives he has produced. There will only be increased scrutiny as the goalkeeper makes his name, with opposition sides becoming more familiar with his weaknesses.",
      "\"The first impression is really important in our club,\" Amorim said. \"He had a very good impression.",
      "\"Then he needs to understand in our club the last game doesn't matter, he needs to focus on the next game. Then he needs to understand the game, what kind of players he's going to face.",
      "He needs to understand people watched him during the game, they know how he wants the ball and kicks the ball. All of the small details he needs to improve every day.",
      "\"I think he shows he's really composed. It's a different environment [against Liverpool] but I'm not concerned about that.\"",
      "United face a Liverpool side that has lost three games in a row. Defeats against Chelsea, Crystal Palace, and Crystal Palace have slowed the Reds' momentum under Arne Slot.",
      "Amorim is not expecting anything less than the best from United's rivals at Anfield on Sunday however. The 40-year-old has a great deal of respect for his adversary.",

      "Manchester United will head to Anfield on Sunday to take on Liverpool, having not won at their arch rivals since 2016. Ruben Amorim has largely struggled since taking the reins at Old Trafford in November 2024, however, United's performance away to Liverpool last season remains one of their best under his management so far.",
      "While United didn't take the three points, they held the eventual Premier League champions to a 2-2 draw. The showing was indicative of Amorim's tenure so far, performing well against the league's top sides but stumbling against the so-called 'lesser' outfits.",
      "After the game, Amorim and his United captain, Bruno Fernandes, spoke to the media about their anguish at United's Jekyll and Hyde-like performances. That frustrating trend, however, looks to have continued into this season.",
      "While United have beaten Chelsea, and performed well against league leaders Arsenal this season, they have lost to Grimsby Town in the League Cup, away to Brentford and were held 1-1 away to Fulham.",
      "\"If we play against Liverpool every day we will do that,\" Amorim said after the 2-2 draw last season. \"So we have to do it against any opponent and to understand that we have to fight really bad to get out of this situation.",
      "He added: \"The way we were really competitive, that is the crucial thing going forward. I'm happy for the performance, not happy for the result but I'm really mad because of the other games.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez had put United in front early in the second half of last season's clash. Cody Gakpo's equaliser was then followed by a Mohamed Salah penalty that looked to have secured the three points for Arne Slot's side.",
      "However, Amad Diallo made it honours even, with United even squandering several late opportunities to win the game.",
      "Fernandes later revealed that he was \"upset\" by United's apparent inability to transfer their positive performance against their North West rivals to other games throughout the campaign - a factor that is still haunting United a season on.",
      "\"Criticised and fairly because the position in the table says it all, we lost too many points,\" Fernandes said after the tie. \"Even today we can't be happy with a draw because we need points more than they did. It was a really good result, we could have even won the game in the end but it's a fair result.",
      "\"I'm pretty upset because if we show this today at Anfield against Liverpool, who are first in the league and probably the outstanding team in the Premier League this season, why can't we do this every week?\"",
      "United have not beaten Liverpool in the Premier League since August 2022. However, the Reds head into Sunday's clash with United off the back of three defeats in a row.",
      "Speaking of his side's promising showing last term, Amorim echoed last season's comments in a press conference this week: “Yeah, I remember it, we played well, it was a draw.",
      "\"I was really upset in the end of the game because we proved, on that day, that we can compete against any opponents.",
      "\"I know that it's special for our club. I know that they are fighting all the time for the titles, the number of titles. I know what it means to the fans, but again, it's one game that we need to prove again, that we are playing better.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood earned rave reviews from media across Europe after his stunning four-goal haul fired Marseille to the summit of Ligue 1 with a thrilling 6-2 victory over Le Havre. The former Manchester United forward made history for the French giants as he netted four in Saturday's dramatic encounter at the Stade Velodrome.",
      "Former Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi, who has previously endured some struggles getting the most out of Greenwood, watched his side fall behind to the visitors before the ex-England international levelled from the penalty spot. But the real fireworks were reserved for the closing stages as spectators were treated to five goals in a breathtaking final 25 minutes.",
      "Marseille capitalised on their numerical advantage after Gautier Lloris received his marching orders in the 34th minute. Greenwood, who was reportedly interested in a Premier League comeback in the summer, was the chief beneficiary as European outlets heaped praise on his remarkable display.",
      "Spanish newspaper AS described him as \"A Greenwood from another planet\" in their match coverage. Having found the net 21 times in France's top flight last campaign, the 24-year-old has already got six goals in just eight league appearances this term.",
      "French sports daily L'Equipe described Greenwood's showing as \"a near-perfect performance\" as Marseille climbed to the top of the table. This came despite De Zerbi acknowledging his team's display was far from polished for significant periods of the match.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Le Monde also spotlighted the standing ovation that welcomed Greenwood as he left the pitch in the 79th minute. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also slammed for squandering what ought to have been a certain goal after a \"golden pass\" from his English team-mate.",
      "Marseille made the most of their opponents' shortcomings earlier this weekend. Champions Paris Saint-Germain dropped points after a 3-3 stalemate at home to Strasbourg on Friday, while Lyon also stumbled following a 3-2 loss at Nice on Saturday.",
      "By contrast, Marseille has now secured five Ligue 1 victories on the bounce and leads PSG by a single point for now. L'Equipe also emphasised the importance of his four-goal haul at the Stade Velodrome.",
      "The last Marseille player to net four in a Ligue 1 match was French icon Jean-Pierre Papin, who managed that same sun in a 7-0 demolition of Lyon back in 1991. He also enters distinguished territory after taking his Ligue 1 total to 27 goals in a little more than one campaign.",
      "The last English footballer to reach that mark in France was Glenn Hoddle, who enjoyed four years at Monaco between 1987 and 1991. Marseille will face a much tougher challenge when they visit Lens next weekend.",
      "Nevertheless, it's clearer than ever Greenwood, who joined Marseille from Getafe in a £26.5million move last year, will play a crucial part if Les Olympiens are to claim their first league crown since 2010.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United legend Beckham has been critical of the Glazers' controversial ownership in the past, but they would only consider offers of more than £5billion for their stake. That figure is more than double what the club is currently worth on the stock market. The Glazers took control two decades ago in a £790m deal, and the club’s current value is only around £2bn.",
      "However, the US businessmen would demand a big premium to cover any possible future increase in United's value if the club pursues plans to build a new state-of-the-art stadium. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos took over football operations after purchasing a 27.7 per cent stake in February 2024, which has since grown to nearly 29 per cent.",
      "Despite Ratcliffe's minority takeover, there have been whispers lately suggesting that the United co-owner may be compelled to sell his share due to a clause in an agreement with the Glazers, should they decide to offload their controlling shares.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has come in for a bit of stick for suggesting his long spells of mediocre form in recent times have, in part, been down to an ‘inconsistent environment’. Neither Roy Keane nor Wayne Rooney were particularly savage in their responses to that suggestion but both came up with mildly stinging rebukes for Rashford.",
      "“He was part of the problem with the environment,” said Keane. Rooney had a similar script, saying: “I think the environment has not been right but that is down to yourself.”",
      "Considering there has been the odd situation in which Rashford’s behaviour away from the pitch has been questioned, Rooney and Keane might well have a point. But any idea Rashford has behaved like some sort of serial wrong ‘un over the last couple of years is way, way off the mark.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of football kits and merch from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "A couple of misjudgements? Yes. But anything serious? No. And if Rashford was referring to managerial churn when he spoke about an ‘inconsistent environment’, then he has a point.",
      "Since Rashford made his Manchester United debut in 2016, there have been - including interim and caretaker bosses - eight managers. Systems, methods, personnel have all changed frequently during Rashford’s professional career at Old Trafford.",
      "Of course, that is no excuse for some of the ineffective - and quite lengthy - periods of football Rashford has produced for United. But it must have had an impact.",
      "The underlying reasons for Rashford wanting to get out of Old Trafford still might have to be addressed as the 27-year-old attacker has a United contract that runs until the summer of 2028. And, of course, the managerial situation might keep on churning.",
      "But this season with Barcelona is now the most important of Rashford’s career. By all accounts, Barca manager Hansi Flick and Thomas Tuchel are not close friends but do have a very respectful working relationship.",
      "Between them, they could yet make Rashford the world-beating player we all know he can be.",
      "Flick has already fired one warning shot across the loanee’s bows, leaving him out of the starting line-up against Getafe after Rashford had been late for training. And in a different way, Flick’s compatriot has done the same.",
      "During the last international break, Tuchel spoke about Rashford having the capability to be “one of the best in the world”, adding there are “no limits” for him. He spoke about him being “explosive”, about him being “fast”, about him being “strong in the air”.",
      "But this is the same Tuchel who has preferred Anthony Gordon to Rashford in the last three of his England starting line-ups. Tuchel talks about Rashford’s “numbers” not being good enough but Gordon’s numbers are not exactly mind-blowing.",
      "But my guess is that Tuchel likes what he sees from the Newcastle winger in training, where Gordon badgers Harry Kane for advice, where he asks goalkeepers to hang around so he can practise his finishing. My guess is that how players commit themselves to even the most routine of training sessions counts for a lot in Tuchel’s book.",
      "Now, there is no suggestion Rashford has not applied himself with anything other than 100 percent commitment in England training. No suggestion whatsoever.",
      "But 100 percent for Tuchel and 100 percent for Flick is all that will do for Rashford if he is to re-invent himself as a world-beater for club and country. Those two guys will stand for nothing less. Let’s hope Marcus gives them exactly that.",

      "\"Barca also had their chances, especially with Rashford, who was incisive and dangerous from set pieces, but the match seemed doomed to a draw, or even a point could be feared on the counterattack. Rashford was doing more damage on the left than in midfield.\"",
      "Rashford received two stars – a positive rating – for his performance from the Spanish outlet Marca. Fernando Carnerero wrote: \"The Blaugrana's response was a shot from close range by De Jong that [Paulo] Gazzaniga sent out for a corner, and a Rashford free kick that hit the crossbar.",

      "Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard has taken a playful swipe at Gary Neville after netting the winner against Fulham on Saturday evening. The Gunners had failed to triumph at Craven Cottage in their previous two visits.",
      "However, the Belgian's finish at the far post secured victory for Mikel Arteta's men and guaranteed they would remain top of the table regardless of the result in Sunday afternoon's clash between Liverpool and Manchester United. Arteta's squad has earned a formidable reputation for its set-piece prowess in recent seasons and is widely regarded as the most effective team in the Premier League, if not Europe, in both attack and defence.",
      "Yet this success has attracted criticism. The north London outfit were accused of placing excessive emphasis on that aspect of their play last season, as Liverpool stormed to Premier League glory.",
      "Meanwhile, United legend Neville was among those who questioned the Gunners' tactics last term - although he did recognise their injury problems at the time. He believed that Arsenal had grown overly dependent on set-pieces during their title race with Liverpool.",
      "\"I certainly felt there would be a drop-off at Liverpool, but Slot has been such a cool customer from day one. He's in complete control.",
      "\"Arsenal have become quite rigid, they've become quite turgid at times to watch. This obsession with set-pieces, which was overtaking their whole game - exacerbated by this presence of their set-piece coach on the touchline which puts more focus on set-pieces. It's like... no. The freedom's gone a little bit from them.",
      "\"I know that they've lost Saka, and I know that they've lost Jesus, and I know they've lost Havertz, which are big blows. I mean, let's be clear, that is a big problem for Arsenal... But I still think you've got to do that job yesterday against West Ham at home.\"",
      "Neville would be proven right by his comments with the Premier League title ending up at Anfield, though it's clear Arsenal stars have not forgotten that criticism. Following his match-winning goal against Marco Silva's team, Trossard quickly took to social media with a cheeky response to his critics, posting: \"Everyone loves a good set-piece, right? [winking emoji].\"",

      "The Red Devils last top flight title came in 2013 under Sir Alex Ferguson, but since then their declined and seen their stock fall. Now qualifying for Europe is seen as a successful season, especially given they finished 15th last season and face a massive gap to the country's elite teams.",
      "Amorim's campaign would likely be deemed a success if he were able to get United back into the Europa League. The consensus is that Champions League qualification would represent an overachievement for the Portuguese head coach.",

      "Gary Neville claimed at the start of the year that a \"top six finish would be healthy\" - a stance Amorim clearly disagrees with given his recent comments.",
      "The ex-player has consistently backed the Red Devils to return, regularly tipping them for the top four. However more recently he's claimed that finishing just above mid-table would be about realistic.",

Liverpool have lost three games on the bounce while United bagged a crucial three points against Sunderland in their final game before the international break.",

      "Stick with us throughout the day with our live blog below.",
      "Liverpool level. Gakpo. It was a huge scramble in the box and the ball is fired across the goal and Gakpo taps in. Nothing Lammens could do.",
      "Liverpool starting to have all the chances and possession now but they are not troubling Lammens too much at the minute. Sesko has been caught offside twice in recent moments.",
      "Chiesa ON",
      "Isak OFF",
      "United caught on the counter. Ekitike cuts inside goes to curl it into the bottom corner but it goes wide. Huge last 20 minutes or so at Anfield.",
      "That was bad from Salah. He is found in the box in acres of space but he lashes it and misses at the near stick.",
      "First chance for Ekitike off the bench. Picks the ball up and runs at United but his shot is high and wide.",

      "Corner goes deep and United do not pick up the men at the back stick. Salah reaches it but his volley goes into the ground and over. Never troubling the 'keeper.",
      "Amad beats Gakpo to the ball, wins it but his follow through goes straight into the winger. First booking of the game there.",
      "It is not looking good for Gravenberch. He is limping and may be able to continue but he was a doubt in midweek before passing a fitness test.",
      "Make that three for Gakpo. He cuts inside from the left, whips it and it clatters the post. That is the hat-trick he did not want today.",

      "We are back underway at Anfield. United are in the lead and good value for it too. The Reds left their hosts waiting out on the pitch - mind games perhaps?",

      "There will be four minutes added on.",
      "This has been the best 45 minutes of Amorim’s tenure so far. United just had another big chance from a set-piece and would have a two-goal advantage if they’d been more clinical. Hopefully that doesn’t come back to haunt them later in the game.",
      "Mamardashvili has looked awful between the sticks for Liverpool and United must target him whenever they get a chance around the box.",
      "That was nearly spectacular for United. Free kick taken by Fernandes, Gakpo lashes at it and it loops up and goes just over the crossbar. That would have been some own goal.",
      "This game is as tasty as you would expect. Mbeumo unhappy he didn't win a free kick, kicks out at Gakpo and escapes a booking.",
      "It is sizzling nicely here.",
      "Huge through ball by Konate splits United in two. Isak bears down on goal but Lammens stays big and saves with his legs.",
      "\"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" Rings out from the away end",
      "Not Gakpo's afternoon so far. He chips one to the back stick and he hits the post.",
      "Salah then tries his luck with a header and Lammens catches it.",
      "First chance for Isak but he snatches at it. The ball trickles harmlessly wide.",
      "Lammens looks comfortable at the moment",
      "Well that was nearly a second. A tackle falls straight to the path of Mbeumo and Mamardashvili does well to block him. The ball falls to Mount and somehow the Liverpool keeper is up to save his strike.",
      "What a chance.",
      "Just get the ball to Amad because he will make something happen in this vein of form. He assisted Mbeumo with a perfectly weighted pass and would have recorded another assist if Fernandes had buried that opportunity. The midfielder placed his hands on his head because he knew what a big chance it was. Liverpool have improved in the last 10 minutes, but they look gettable at the back.",
      "United have been happy to counter-attack with purpose.",
      "Wow what a chance that was. Cunha does well and the ball is worked out to Amad on the edge. He pulls it back and Fernandes clips the post.",
      "That is one for each side now.",
      "Despite losing, Liverpool fans have united to pay tribute to Diogo Jota.",
      "A good gesture and emotional moment."

      "The 20-year-old has not started in the Premier League this season and has been limited to five substitute appearances. Mainoo is desperate to represent England at the 2026 World Cup after featuring at Euro 2024, but he needs to be playing regularly to be included in Thomas Tuchel's plans.",
      "Zirkzee finds himself in a similar situation. The Dutchman is keen to represent the Netherlands at next summer's World Cup, but he's been given just 82 minutes across all competitions.",
      "Mainoo continues to be linked with a move away in the January transfer window and Zirkzee could look to leave if his situation does not improve, but Amorim suggested they are important squad players.",
      "Amorim was asked whether he understood why Mainoo and Zirkzee would be frustrated, especially in a World Cup season, and he responded: \"That is normal. I also know that in our club everything is a lot of noise. You have to have news. Players are not playing. They want to play.",

      "Ruben Amorim joked he is \"really annoyed\" with Bruno Fernandes after missing two penalties for Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes has scored the most penalties for United in Premier League history (23).",
      "The midfielder established himself as the designated penalty-taker during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure and only briefly lost that responsibility during Cristiano Ronaldo's second stint at the club.",
      "Before this season, Fernandes had last missed a penalty against Chelsea in December 2023. The midfielder's penalty record has been exemplary, but he sent a penalty over the crossbar against Fulham at Craven Cottage and his penalty was saved against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Fernandes converted from the spot in added time against Burnley to secure a late victory, but his two penalty misses have led to suggestions that a new penalty taker could be appointed.",
      "Speaking at Friday's press conference, Amorim was asked whether United could change their designated penalty taker, and he laughed as he said he was annoyed with Fernandes.",
      "\"No,\" said Amorim about changing the penalty-taker. \"I know that it's not easy for him. But I think he has 70 penalties. He misses like nine. Two with me. So I'm really annoyed with that.",
      "\"But he's really confident. He's training the penalties. He's trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. So he will be ready. We have more guys also to score a penalty if he needs.\"",
      "Amorim was asked to clarify whether Fernandes remained the designated penalty taker and responded: \"Yes, he's the main taker. He scores a lot of goals. Penalties are passing this moment.",
      "\"We have other options. If we need, we can change. But I'm fully confident that Bruno will sort that out.\"",

      "Manchester United legend David Beckham has already made his stance clear that the Glazers should sell up at Old Trafford - amid rumours of a sensational return to the club as part of a consortium from the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The Mirror reported this weekend that the 50-year-old Inter Miami co-owner has been approached by an unidentified consortium to serve as an ambassador for a potential £5billion takeover of the club.",
      "The group is reportedly set to offer Beckham, who has a net worth of £300million, a chance to return to his former club after expressing criticism of the Glazer ownership in previous years.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and Ineos, purchased a minority shareholding of 27.7 per cent stake in February 2024, which has since grown to nearly 29 per cent.",
      "Ratcliffe has managed the football side of the business since taking over midway through last season; however, performances on the pitch have not improved.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team finished 15th in the Premier League last season, their worst ever finish in the competition, and were defeated in the Europa League final.",
      "When previously asked by The Athletic if it was time for the Glazers to leave the club, prior to Ratcliffe's minority takeover, Beckham said: \"I think so. I think it's purely because the fans want it. Once you lose the fans, especially at a club like Manchester United, it's hard to get them back.",
      "\"Obviously, [the Glazers] have achieved a lot, and financially, the fact that we're even talking about the numbers of what Manchester United will sell for shows the success they've had. But there needs to be change. We've all seen that, we all know that.\"",
      "The ex-United midfielder didn't dismiss the possibility of a future return to the club in some capacity, which would make for intriguing headlines should he agree to lead the UAE takeover.",
      "\"I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business,\" he continued. \"But I haven't been approached and I suppose any involvement with Manchester United would mean the world to me, going forward.",
      "\"But who knows? We'll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. Hopefully, a decision gets made and if I'm involved in any way... If not, I'll be a United fan and just do what all the other fans are doing - turn up and watch our team.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",
      "Beckham also emphasised that the club needed investment, the right people in charge and investment into the stadium, before the plans for a new Old Trafford were revealed. He stated: \"Whoever is running your club, you want them to be passionate, be involved, make the right decisions, bring in the right players and invest in the club.",
      "\"Because the club does need investment, whether it's the training facility, stadium, on the field, these kinds of big things need to be made and changes do need to happen, especially when you see the likes of Man City and what they're doing.\"",
      "The current majority owners of United would reportedly only entertain offers exceeding £5 billion for their stake. This figure is more than double the club's present value on the stock market.",

Amorim hinted that Casemiro could be rested during his press conference, but he should start if he is physically ready to play. Ugarte has been disappointing, albeit he did emerge with credit from the first half against Manchester City.",

      "Mount finds himself in pole position to start having scored against Sunderland prior to the international break. Amorim is a big fan of the former Chelsea man and he finally looks to be finding his feet at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha has yet to get off the mark for the Reds. The Brazilian has shown glimpses of why he was brought to the club but his lack of goal contributions this season needs to come to an end, sooner rather than later.",
      "Some may argue that starting him at Anfield and allowing him the chance to get off the mark against Liverpool would be a vote of confidence for Cunha. But United should be looking to stick with their selection from the win over Sunderland.",
      "Mount is the player with confidence at the moment and he has been given a good rest since the win over the Black Cats given he has been out of the England picture for some time.",
      "Cunha has been on international duty with the Brazil national team this week in Asia and there is no telling what his fitness levels will be after that long flight back to Europe.",
      "A potentially game-changing role off the bench for the 26-year-old could be the smartest option.",

      "Manchester United icon Eric Cantona has already revealed his honest thoughts on the Glazer family and their management of the football club.",
      "The Old Trafford favourite has been linked with a potential takeover at United amid fresh investment talk from the Middle East.",
      "During the international break, takeover rumours sparked when Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for the club.",
      "After clarifying that he was not the potential investor, it has since been reported that a UAE-based consortium has contacted several United legends about being part of a possible takeover. Cantona has been mentioned as one of the individuals included, potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him support a prospective consortium.",
      "The Frenchman has been critical of both the Glazers and minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe in recent weeks. Back in April, Cantona made a drastic move that spoke volumes about his stance on the current state of affairs at United.",
      "Alongside members of his family, Cantona became the latest co-owner of FC United of Manchester.",
      "The manifesto on the club's website states that they hope to \"create a football club which addresses the concerns which many Manchester United fans have had over the 17 years or more with how the club and football have developed, culminating in the club's takeover by Malcolm Glazer\".",
      "The Northern Premier League club was established in 2005 and is fully owned by its supporters on a \"one member, one vote\" basis, with members voting on all major decisions, such as ticket prices and the design of playing shirts.",
      "\"We're delighted to welcome Eric and his family as our latest co-owners, joining over 2,000 other FC United fans who believe there's a better way for football - where clubs are runs with the interests of supporters and local communities at the heart of everything they do,\" a club spokesman said.",
      "\"Eric said he joined us because we're a club that does things differently - driven by fairness, inclusivity, and a commitment to putting people before profit. While our history is short, it's something we're already incredibly proud of - built by fans, for fans.\"",

      "His form at Under-18 level prompted interest from Canada in the forward and Jesse Marsch called the teenager into a senior training camp during the summer in a bid to convince him to join the co-World Cup hosts.",
      "Marsch is a big fan of the United prospect, telling reporters in Canada in May: \"He's a dynamic player. He's very good around the goal. You can see he's an intelligent player.",
      "\"He's a version of Jonathan David. He's not exactly the same player but he's a striker that can play up on the backline and is also good at coming underneath and connecting plays and being part of the build-up phase.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with Gabe and his family. He has several options to think about in what country he wants to represent.",
      "\"I think it's really important that the family feels the connection to Canada.\"",
      "Biancheri subsequently made his debut for Wales Under-21s in September and has this week scored his first goal for his country in a fine 2-0 win over Austria.",
      "He opened his account in the 25th minute of his first start when he capitalised on a loose back pass from David Heindl to sit the goalkeeper down before rolling the ball into an empty net. Chris Popov snatched a second for the Welsh in the 90th minute.",
      "Biancheri's performance caught the eye in Austria and led to some speculating he could earn a call into Craig Bellamy's senior squad for the November internationals.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned that he may not be able to get the best out of Benjamin Sesko with his current set-up.",
      "The 22-year-old arrived at Old Trafford in a £74million transfer from RB Leipzig this summer, with Manchester United pipping Newcastle United to his signature. And while the Slovenian impressed in the Bundesliga, he has failed to make much of an impact in the Premier League.",
      "At present, Sesko has scored just two goals from seven appearances for the Reds, and while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he is clearly still a player in development in one of the most physically demanding leagues in the world. And according to former United star Danny Simpson, history could repeat itself at the club if the striker doesn't receive the right support.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the MEN via MightyTips about United's business this summer, Simpson said: \"I think, right, if we are going to play 3-4-3, which we're doing, and not 4-3-3, which now would suit [Bryan] Mbeumo, Bruno [Fernandes] and [Matheus] Cunha and Sesko - to be honest with you, I think it would - why didn't we buy a centre-mid?",
      "\"You know, let's not pick one of the two, Mbeumo and Cunha. But did we need them both? And you could have had Bruno and one of them and a centre-mid, so Bruno's not playing deep.",
      "\"So, yes, in terms of that, were they trying to get a centre-mid? Maybe they did and he didn't get it over the line - the lad from Brighton [Carlos Baleba], but it was a lot of money. Listen, they brought great players in, but in terms of what we actually need, it's not working right now.",
      "\"Obviously, we prefer Bruno higher. Sesko, I think he will come good, but I just think he also...It would help him to have an experienced striker with him, similar to what's happened with [Rasmus] Hojlund.",
      "“We don't want that to happen again, where it just becomes a point where it's like, so young, it's such a burden, that shirt up front on your own, you've got no help, and before you know it, it's too much.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund arrived at Old Trafford in a £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, but failed to live up to his price tag in the years that followed. The 22-year-old managed just four Premier League goals last term from 32 games last season, as the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Sesko were brought in this summer to give United an attacking edge.",
      "As a result of inconsistency in the north west, Hojlund joined Napoli on a season-long loan this summer, with the Serie A giants holding a £38m obligation to buy the player next year, based on certain requirements being met.",
      "While he is thriving with his new club - with two goals from four games to his name - some fans believe that the issue with his time at United was not having the support of a senior striker to show him the ropes as he continued to develop.",
      "Meanwhile, over in Naples, Hojlund has the likes of Romelu Lukaku and Lorenzo Lucca to impart their wisdom on him both on and off the pitch. It comes as Amorim will hope for more consistency from Sesko when the club return to Premier League action this weekend.",
      "The Reds are currently gearing up to face Arne Slot's Liverpool on Sunday, October 19 at Anfield in the first Northwest derby of the season.",
      "While United won their last top flight clash ahead of the international break with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland, Liverpool are currently suffering a three-game losing streak thanks to losses at the hands of Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones is embarking on a journey towards management.",
      "The 33-year-old, who hung up his boots last year, has set his sights on securing a top position in the future but acknowledges he must still prove himself worthy.",
      "Jones is presently pursuing his UEFA Pro Licence and has been involved with United's academy players at Carrington during recent campaigns as he transitions from an injury-riddled playing career.",
      "The former Blackburn talent recognises there's considerable groundwork ahead before landing his inaugural managerial role.",
      "\"I don't think there's a right or wrong way,\" Jones told BetMGM. \"People say to me go and take an Under 18s, some say go and be an assistant somewhere.",
      "\"Do I think I'm ready to become a manager? No. I'm not naive and daft enough to think I'm just going to walk into a job. It doesn't work like that. I have to earn the right with steps and progression.",
      "\"But do I think I could add value into a team now? Yeah. I played under a lot of good managers and with good players, I've taken a lot of things from various parts of the game on and off the pitch. That's the goal. That's where I want to be. Let's see.\"",
      "Jones has been content to develop his skills within United's youth system and didn't wish to rush into securing a senior position elsewhere before he felt prepared. And he reckons he has gained from that approach.",
      "\"I didn't want to just come out of the game and say, 'I'll take that manager's job',\" he said. \"I wanted to go about it the right way. Just because I played at United for 13 years, you can't expect to get the biggest jobs.",
      "\"I was on the grass with the kids coaching, and you come away from a session thinking, 'How can I adapt, how can I change it, how can I make it better?'",
      "\"You start thinking about the game more. I don't just watch a game of football now, you're engrossed in patterns of play and systems and how they set up tactically in and out of possession.\"",
      "Looking back on his former club's management situation, Jones is encouraged by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's support of Ruben Amorim. Nevertheless, the coach reckons it will mean nothing if the Portuguese manager fails to deliver results.",
      "Jones reckons Sunday's clash with Liverpool could prove pivotal in determining the direction of United's campaign. The former Old Trafford favourite would be delighted to see Amorim claim silverware.",
      "\"Do I want to see any manager or coach losing their job? No, especially with the route I want go down now,\" he said. \"You need time to get your squad together. I like the fact Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come out and backed him, as you would expect. But it's a results business. If you don't get results, I don't care what length of contract you're on – 10 years, two years, five years – there will be questions and you will be looked at.",
      "\"Sunderland (a 2-0 win before the international break) was probably the most complete performance I've seen from United this season in every department. But then you play Liverpool, your fierce rivals (on Sunday). If you don't win there, you've got Brighton coming up and that's not an easy game the way they're playing at the minute.",
      "\"If you get a draw against Liverpool and then go and beat Brighton at home, you've gathered a bit of momentum and can they really kick on and use it as a catalyst to do something? How many times have we said that over the last six years? Would I like to see Amorim succeed, do really well in the back end of this season and maybe win a trophy? Of course. I'd love nothing more.\"",

      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United supporters ought to be worried by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's commitment to giving Ruben Amorim the full duration of his three-year contract to demonstrate his managerial credentials - despite the difficulties faced during his opening 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils appointed Amorim as Erik ten Hag's replacement last November, but as he approaches his first year in charge, he's secured victory in fewer than a third of his Premier League matches and oversaw United's poorest-ever campaign last season.",
      "This term, despite over £200million being invested in their attacking options, familiar problems remain, and the side find themselves in mid-table having suffered defeats in three of their seven fixtures so far. Amorim's appropriateness for the position has come under scrutiny, particularly given his determination to maintain his philosophy and display minimal flexibility.",
      "However, he continues to enjoy support from the boardroom and Ratcliffe appeared on The Times' Business podcast to emphasise that any hasty decision-making is unlikely to yield superior outcomes. The Ineos chief declared: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "But ex-United shot-stopper Foster questioned whether the absence of meaningful progress is being properly considered. He said: \"If I was a Man United fan, I'd be a little bit worried about that because, a club like Manchester United, it's always about progression.",
      "\"You've got to be seen to be progressing and as it stands at the minute they are not progressing. 10th in the league at the minute. It's just the lack of consistency.",
      "\"Obviously, they've won the game against Sunderland now before the international break, but they've got some tough games coming up. Liverpool on Sunday. It's that consistency that they need to find. If they can start to do the three, four, five games winning in a row, then they can really shoot up the table. But as it stands at the minute, it's so hit and miss.\"",
      "Amorim has yet to secure back-to-back victories in the Premier League since arriving in Manchester. United claimed a crucial three points against Sunderland prior to the international break, but now travel to Anfield this weekend, facing an uphill battle.",
      "Victory for Liverpool could intensify scrutiny on the United manager, though Ratcliffe has dismissed speculation surrounding his position following each defeat.",
      "\"The press, sometimes I don't understand,\" he said last week. \"They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Some fans have joked Mount is the teacher's pet at Manchester United, but he wasn't picked to start in a must-win game against Sunderland because he gets along with Amorim.",
      "Mount started because of the quality, pressing and energy he brings to the team, and he admitted during his post-match chat that he considers himself the \"catalyst\" for the press.",
      "The 26-year-old vindicated his selection just eight minutes into the game when he finished brilliantly at the Stretford End and he might have done enough to retain his starting role against Liverpool.",
      "Mount started against Sunderland at the expense of Matheus Cunha, who might have to settle for a role off the bench again at Anfield when United make the trip to Merseyside on Sunday.",
      "Cunha hasn't put a foot wrong since joining from Wolves in the summer. The Brazilian is yet to score or assist, but his all-round performances have been strong down the left flank.",
      "He was unfortunate not to get off the mark against Fulham at Craven Cottage (Cunha hit the post and was also denied at point-blank range) and it feels like only a matter of time before he breaks his duck.",
      "However, it feels like Amorim will start Mount on the left side in the No.10 role against Liverpool because his work ethic will be hugely beneficial against the Premier League champions in their own backyard.",
      "Cunha has improved that aspect of his game - Wolves' coaches challenged him to improve when not in possession - but he isn't known for working tirelessly backwards and forwards.",
      "That's not to say Cunha doesn't work hard. He has demonstrated his willingness to work his socks off since signing for United, but Mount may be seen as the better option for Anfield.",
      "United is such a big club that rotating a player for tactical reasons can feel like a story - especially if that player is a relatively new signing and was signed for a multi-million-pound fee.",
      "The truth is Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the Premier League due to their strength in depth. They regularly rotate players and there is no hysterical reaction when a player is benched.",
      "It won't be a big deal if Cunha is named on the bench again this weekend, it would merely be a selection decision made by Amorim to give United the best chance of leaving Anfield with a positive result.",
      "Liverpool are likely to dominate the ball on Sunday afternoon. United will have to work meticulously out of possession, press efficiently and players will have to win their individual battles.",
      "United last won at Anfield in 2016 when Louis van Gaal was in charge and the bookmakers have made Liverpool heavy favourites to win the fixture, but the contest should be closer than the odds suggest.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",
      "Amorim is yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches since becoming Man Utd manager around a year ago with the Red Devils boss picking up just 37 points from 34 matches.",
      "That has led to rumours that Amorim could be sacked if those poor results persist but Sir Jim Ratcliffe hinted that the Portuguese coach could remain at Man Utd for three years as he gives him a chance to proove himself.",
      "After Ratcliffe’s comments were put to him, Keane said: “Listen, I think it’s probably good getting the backing off the club and the board, but results obviously have to improve. You hope, of course, any manager is given time. Whether he’s going to get three years to play with, it will depend on how they do over next few months.",
      "READ: Why Ruben Amorim is ‘really annoyed’ with Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes",
      "“They have picked up a little bit, we said at the start of the season, with a couple of attacking players they look like more of a goal threat, and particularly at home, they’ve improved their home record, and on the back of a nice result to home to Sunderland, which I fully expect them to win.",
      "“But the big tests are still games like today [against Liverpool]. What kind of group they have? Are going to turn up here today and show their quality going forward? Are they trying to grind the result out? Are they going to be physical? Are they going to put tackles in? So there’s still huge question marks away from home. Yeah, they’ve picked up, but coming to Liverpool a huge test for me.",
      "“There’s still huge question marks over this United group. I just don’t see it at this moment in time, but the signs are a little bit better going forward, but you still worry about in midfield, in terms of the physicality, and you worry about them defensively. And again, question marks still over the goalkeeper situation.”",
      "Carragher chipped in: “I actually want to come in on those comments, because I understand what the owner is trying to do. He’s trying to quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“So he comes out to defend his man. He talks about, you know, he’s got three years. But he almost doesn’t help him by saying it, because nobody believes it. Nobody believes for one minute that Ruben Amorim will be the manager of Manchester United in three years.",
      "“If he just said, ‘we’ve got no plans to change our coach over the next 12 months.’ I think we’d go ‘okay, maybe they could get to the end of the season. Maybe things can improve. They can get someone in January.’ That would almost feel like a vote of confidence in that, you know, quell the talk of the manager losing his job.",
      "“But to come out and say three years, we all know that, as Roy’s just said, if the results keep going as they’re going he’s going to lose his job, unfortunately. So even though he’s come out trying to help him, I don’t think he has actually helped him with those comments in the end.”",
      "Before Redknapp went in hard on Amorim for failing to win back-to-back matches at Man Utd, he said: “When you’ve not won back-to-back games in the Premier League as Man United manager, you are coming under intense pressure. I think you could get any manager in any league in England and I fancy him to pick a team with this Man United squad, and win back to back games, that would be the challenge.",
      "“And it can’t be that difficult, but he’s making it look difficult every single week, like Roy says, some weeks you watch him and say: ‘yeah, there’s glimpses here, they’ve got a chance. They’ve got some good players, good performances.’ Then it will just go back to the madness and the same substitutions. Forget the system, he’s  not going to change it whatever we say.",
      "“But you can’t not win back-to-back games as Manchester United manager and then say that he’s going to still be there three years. It just doesn’t make any sense.",
      "“It’s not the real world. And also, if he’s still there after a year, and this is not changing, the fans will dictate that. They won’t suffer it because they want to see change. They don’t like the situation the club are in.”",

      "Other than the brief spell when Cristiano Ronaldo returned to take responsibility for spot kicks, Fernandes has been United’s designated penalty taker since his joined the club in January 2020, and has scored 39 of his 45, excluding shootouts.",
      "There have been doubts raised as to whether he will continue in the role, particularly following Bryan Mbeumo’s arrival from Brentford in the summer. The Cameroon international scored 11 of his 12 penalties for the Bees.",
      "But Amorim insists he has no plans to change his penalty taker, backing Fernandes to improve his record under him, which he admits is “really annoying” given his excellence since joining the club.",
      "“I know that it’s not easy for him [Fernandes], but I think he has 70 penalties, and he misses like nine. Two with me, so I’m really annoyed with that,” the head coach said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "“But he’s really confident. He’s training the penalties, he’s trying to understand that people are watching the way he scores the penalties. So, he’ll be ready.",

      "Al-Sheikh wrote on X: ‘The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor – I hope he’s better than the previous owners.’",
      "But, after realising that some Man Utd fans were speculating that he or another Saudi Arabian was looking at buying the club, Al-Sheikh clarified his comments.",
      "Posting again the day after, Al-Sheikh wrote: ‘My yesterday’s post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",

      "Reports suggested that the group wanting to buy Man Utd is a UAE-based consortium with Red Devils officials apparently holding a ‘meeting’ with them earlier this week.",
      "And now, according to the Star and Mirror (via The Independent), ‘the consortium would like former United winger Beckham to be an ambassador for the bid’.",
      "Beckham has been ‘approached to back a takeover bid’ with the group reportedly ‘preparing to make an offer to buy the Glazers’ majority shareholding in the club’.",
      "When asked in July 2023 if the Glazers should go, Beckham said in an interview with The Athletic: “I think so. I think it’s purely because the fans want it.",
      "“Once you lose the fans, especially at a club like Manchester United, it’s hard to get them back.",
      "“Obviously, they (the Glazers) have achieved a lot, and financially, the fact we’re even talking about the numbers of what Manchester United will sell for shows the success they’ve had. But there needs to be change. We’ve all seen that, we all know that.”",
      "On whether he could see himself having a role at Man Utd in the future, Beckham added: “I have a lot going on here at the moment and my focus has purely been on Miami and everything that goes on in my business.",
      "“But I haven’t been approached and I suppose any involvement with Manchester United would mean the world to me, going forward. But who knows?",
      "“We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks or months. Hopefully, a decision gets made and if I’m involved in any way… if not, I’ll be a United fan and just do what all the other fans are doing – turn up and watch our team.”",
      "Football finance expert Dan Plumley has described the potential implications of Man Utd’s share price increasing by eight per cent amid recent takeover rumours.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “It’s a reaction to the media stuff we saw around the Saudi Arabia potential, the quote from the fairly well renowned Saudi Arabia individual who put this out there and speculated around a takeover that’s what’s driven the share price up ultimately.",
      "“It’s absolutely fuelled by speculation around a takeover. For what it means for the club, it’s more for the shareholders, the investors, any share price going up reflects positively on them ultimately and that means that the share price is higher.",
      "“It won’t make too big a difference to the day-to-day finances and the operations of the club. In terms of the share price going up you treat those things as good news stories for a company that the share price is increasing.",
      "“That share price ultimately is going to benefit the shareholders and the investors at a certain point in time, which is again the other side of the coin with this one because the current owners don’t look like they want to sell right now and Jim Ratcliffe came in for the minority stakes so its them who would benefit from a share increase but obviously they are not looking to sell the club.”",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Nottingham Forest’s second sacking of the season means long-suffering Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is back as the favourite to be the next manager gone…",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham – even that they managed to make a pig’s ear of – and replaced by sack-race winner Nuno Espirito Santo, who already finds himself in the top three of this list as the Hammers weigh up copying Forest’s double axeing.",
      "Forest dismissing Postecoglou means his sensible move to Man Utd is a step closer, while failing United boss Amorim is far more suited to the other Premier League strugglers than the Red Devils.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Although what does need saying here is that there is a wild divergence in opinion on Slot’s job security. He is – entirely absurdly – joint third-favourite in some places. But we’re interested in the best available prices, and on that basis he’s as safe as Mikel Arteta.",
      "But however ridiculous it may sound, there are bookmakers out there who consider Slot’s position to be less secure than anyone in the league who isn’t Ange Postecoglou or Ruben Amorim.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Nottm Forest was handy, too.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",

Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester in which Wilfred Ndidi and James Maddison were the scorers, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the Raphinha and Rodrigo-inspired loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",

      "Graham Potter has followed Jose Mourinho and Sam Allardyce in accomplishing a rare Premier League manager sacking feat after his West Ham exit.",
      "The following is a rundown of the clubs a Premier League coach faced last before losing their job, and the respective managers who were in charge of them. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "",
      "From Ron Atkinson, who induced the first managerial sacking in Premier League history when Chelsea axed Ian Porterfield after a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in February 1993, to Oliver Glasner, who forced West Ham’s hand when Crystal Palace beat Graham Potter’s side in September 2025, 61 different coaches have proven to be the last straw for one Premier League manager.",

      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Marcus Rashford’s permanent move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona could hinge on one key condition.",
      "In the summer, Rashford joined Barcelona from Man Utd on loan with an option to buy for around £30m.",
      "Barcelona decided to take a punt on Rashford after failing to acquire Nico Williams and Luiz Diaz, with the England international’s versatility and return to form at Aston Villa helping him secure his dream transfer.",
      "This transfer is paying off for Barcelona and Rashford as the forward has three goals and five assists in his ten appearances this season.",

      "“It’s a sad thing from Man United’s point of view that I don’t see him coming back, but I have no doubt there are a lot of clubs keeping an eye on his situation,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "READ: ‘Petty’ Amorim ‘hate narrative’ debunked as 50 more stars in extended England World Cup ladder",
      "“If he doesn’t stay at Barcelona, there will be no shortage of interest in him, especially if he can keep up the form he has shown.",

      "“In all the conversations he has had with Hansi Flick and in all the conversation also internally at Barcelona with people at the club, Marcus Rashford is being very clear his desire is to be a Barcelona player beyond this season,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“Rashford is doing very well. He’s very happy with the club, with the coach, with the city, with the teammates, Rashford is loving his life at Barcelona and the idea for Rashford is to try to stay at Barca if they decide to keep him and if they will be able to reach an agreement with Man United, either triggered by their buy option of close to €30 million or to negotiate with United.",
      "“We will see what happens in summer 2026 if Barcelona want to keep Rashford. In that case, my understanding is that Rashford could also be open to have a discussion on a different kind of salary structure compared to his current one at Man United in order to facilitate a potential move to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford already changed his salary structure in order to join Barcelona, but United are not paying his salary. Barcelona is paying the main part of the salary and the other part is something that Marcus Rashford decided to accept not to take in order to be a Barcelona player this season.",
      "“It’s still very early to predict the future of Rashford, but there is a very good feeling between Rashford, Barcelona and Flick. Obviously we have to see in the second half of the season what happens.",
      "“Nothing will be decided now in October, in November, in December, this is not the time to reach agreements for summer 2026. But the feeling now is very good.”",
      "Manchester United are reportedly willing to ‘agree’ a once ‘unthinkable’ deal on one key condition, while Fabrizio Romano has an update on a transfer.",

      "So there was a call for reply by an Amorim supporter and though that’s not how I’d class myself the fact I don’t want his head on a pike likely means that’s how you see me. Your regular letters bashing United for one thing or another needn’t come with a warning like Stewie’s rants because you can see them coming a mile off, and though this current thorn in your arse regards the academy we all know its rooted in the decision to ditch your messiah Ten Hag 12 months ago. Time to get over that one I think.",
      "However to stay on topic, the talents you’ve singled out are indeed promising players though which Fletcher are you referring to? Them being twins does mean there are two of them. The choice of Lacey and Biancheri seems more about their slight builds than anything, they are still teenagers though so perhaps that always be the case and you only have to look at Amorim favourite Bruno to see that if you’re good enough then size doesn’t matter to him.",
      "The academy does have many other promising players and some might be very well suited to the current system. Where are your comments on Kone, Scanlon, or Ibragimov. The Fletcher brothers could do very well and so too Mantato. Its almost like you chose a few very specific examples to help push your Amorim hating narrative.",
      "You don’t actually care about the progress of these lads at all. We can see this in the total absence of concern for all those previous academy lads that didn’t make it at United. I don’t recall your furious letters demanding United change how they play for the delicate Shoretire and where was your anger for Andreas Periera, James Garner, and Angel Gomes.",
      "When it comes down to it your base argument is backward. The academy exists to produce players that are good enough for the first team. The academy adapts to the first team requirements, not the other way around. If some players make it then great, if they don’t then I’m sure they will have good careers elsewhere, that’s the simple fact of every academy. Trying to twist this into a negative against the current manager who you don’t like is just petty.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "Hi Mailbox,",
      "It’s my view that the pool of England qualified players is deeper than I can ever recall. 10 years or so ago I think it was probably hard to find 50 plausible players to fill the ladder. I thought to myself today – ‘all of those 50 (apart from Phil) are perfectly plausible contenders for an England squad, I wonder whether we can get to 100’. So I tried that.",
      "Short answer is, no I don’t really think there are 100 plausible options there, but there might be 75. I’d be interested to know what others think!",
      "Here’s the list:",
      "51) Liam Delap – given the paucity of non-Harry Kane striking options, Delap will leap way into the top 50 if he can get fit and scoring. Big if, but he has the tools.",
      "52) Mason Mount – we know Tuchel likes him, and understandably so given his excellence in Chelsea’s European Cup winning campaign. Presses well, consummate team man, but significant competition in the attacking midfield means he would need to up his game significantly . This might be difficult in such a dysfunctional side as Man Utd.",
      "53) Benjamin White – has he declared himself available? Not sure. And possibly not getting enough minutes, given the form of the exemplary Timber. But has a great relationship with Saka and can defend well, thus ticking a couple of Tuchely boxes.",
      "54) Rico Lewis – despite being just 20 he has 62 Manchester City appearances and 5 for England, however he hasn’t made a squad for more than a year. He’s a skilled, adaptable operator but the feeling persists that he may be too physically slight for both Tuchel and Pep for his preferred full back and defensive midfield roles.",
      "55) Eric Dier – with 49 caps, he could be a leadershippy, experiencey squad pick in the mould of Jordan Henderson. He’s somewhat versatile and is still playing regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. In a 26 man squad, he wouldn’t be the worst 26th man.",
      "56) Tyrick Mitchell – unlucky to only have two England caps, but could be hampered by playing as wing-back in a back three system that England are unlikely to deploy. He’s been integral for Palace and might deserve a chance in a position that is yet to be definitively claimed.",
      "57) Angel Gomes – a key man for Lee Carlsey, who used his passing skills as a crucial midfield pivot. He’s been surpassed by Elliott Anderson and probably Adam Wharton too, but he is playing Champions League football at Marseille and could be a decent option if required.",
      "58) James Maddison – badly injured, but could he play his way into contention by getting fit and firing by the end of the season? Probably not.",
      "59) Joe Gomez – it’s hard to believe he’s still only 28, but he’s a dependable and versatile defender who rarely lets Liverpool down when called upon. He’s suffered a bit with injuries, but given the form of Konate, I could easily see him getting a run in the Liverpool side, which could precipitate a return to the England reckoning.",
      "60) James Tarkowski – he’s a really good defender, in the head it and block it mould of Dan Burn, and like Burn he’s probably an underrated distributor too. A substantial England career might have passed him by, but I wouldn’t be concerned if I saw him in the squad.",
      "61) Rio Ngumoha – if he were to nail down the spot on the left of Liverpool’s attack, his talent is such that he could challenge Gordon and Rashford for a spot. This will probably happen one day, but it’s unlikely to be this season given he’s just 17.",
      "62) Jamie Gittens – frankly it’s a bit odd that a player signed for nearly 50 million from Dortmund by Chelsea is this low, but I haven’t really seen him do anything much in a Chelsea shirt as yet. Perhaps he’ll explode into life in time to make a late run into squad contention.",
      "63) Tyrone Mings – was thrown into the England Team in Euro 2020 (2021, really) and let nobody down. I can’t really see a repeat happening, especially given Villa’s form, but you never know.",
      "64) James McAtee – the captain of the successful England U21 side in the summer, he’s not really found his feet at Forest yet. He’s a tidy and skilled player, but will have to motor to warrant consideration in such a stacked position.",
      "65) James Garner – playing really well for Everton under Moyes and could definitely be a thought if messrs Anderson, Henderson and Wharton were all to get caught in some sort of freak yachting accident.",
      "66) Alex Scott – same as James Garner, really.",
      "67) Jadon Sancho – what has gone on with him? Chelsea paid money to avoid signing him permanently. Clearly, there is talent there. He showed that when loaned back to Dortmund, but he’s never shown it in the Premiership and that looks unlikely to change at Villa, who clearly only signed him in desperation.",
      "68) Tyler Dibling – a fun player to watch and a sensational dribbler, but currently doesn’t have the end product to truly push himself into contention. I’m not sure that will change this season, but am hopeful it may in the future.",
      "69) Archie Gray – acquitted himself well while playing out of position in a dreadful Spurs side last season, but has only played 72 premier league minutes this time round. A talented player who may go onto win many caps, but I suspect that his time is still to come.",
      "70) Callum Hudson-Odoi – he was stellar for Forest last season, and may even have deserved a return to the England fold, but Forest being quite so poor this time around cannot he helpful. Has the kind of pacy direct profile that Tuchel seems to value.",
      "71) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall – he’s a nice player and a good signing for Everton. I’d be surprised to see him picked given all the talent in his position.",
      "72) Max Dowman – a generational talent. Unbelievably good for his age. But his age is currently 15. So yeah, bit early.",
      "73) Marcus Tavernier – who is the most unfairly overlooked English player in the Premiership? This guy. Consistently a strong contributor for the excellent Bournemouth, he’s in the top 15% of Premier league attacking midfielders for progressive passes, tackles, and aerials won. Will this be enough to get him in the England squad? Not a chance.",
      "74) Jacob Murphy – on the subject of being overlooked… if it was ever going to happen for Murphy, it was probably last season, where he received no sniff of a call-up despite 8 goals and 12 assists. Unfortunate really, but it’s not going to happen.",
      "75) Jacob Ramsey – Newcastle spent big money on him in the Summer and have wanted him for some time. He moves with the ball very well. However, he’s not really played much in the black and white, so doesn’t seem a likely prospect.",
      "76) Lloyd Kelly – it feels a bit weird that a Juventus first-team central defender is English and yet he is nowhere near the England squad, but here we are.",
      "77) Brooke Norton-Cuffy – funnily enough, he’s also been linked with Juve, and he has been looking a fine prospect for Genoa and the England u-21s. He can certainly get up and down the right touchline with aplomb and might feature one day. But not soon.",
      "78) Max Kilman – he’s been closer to the England team at points in the past. Doesn’t help that West Ham are faintly rubbish.",
      "79) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – his England career is probably a thing of the past. But we aren’t exactly replete with back up strikers, so a decent run of form could drive him upwards on this list. Do I think that’s likely? No.",
      "80) Jobe Bellingham – the lesser Bellingham, but not lacking in talent. He probably needs to stop his dad from bickering with the powers-that-be at Dortmund and put a sustained run of form together. Even if he does, it’s likely too soon for him.",
      "81) Jack Hinshelwood – always looks pretty good at Brighton and quite versatile too. I’d be quite surprised to see that translate into England caps in the short-to-medium term.",
      "82) Fikayo Tomori – if it was ever going to happen for Fikayo, it’s not now. Shame really. He was born in Canada – might be worth exploring that.",
      "83) Josh King – an ever present for Fulham this season and a lovely, balanced dribbler. Definitely too soon for him.",
      "84) Charlie Cresswell – played well for England u21s and a strong player for Toulouse. Probably needed a move to a bigger club if he was going to contend for the World Cup squad.",
      "85) Tyler Morton – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Lyon and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "86) CJ Egan-Riley – playing regularly in Ligue 1 for Marseille and has done well for the u21s. That’s not unimpressive. Maybe one day.",
      "87) Omari Hutchinson – Forest signed him for biggish money after a ho-hum season for Ipswich. Looked excellent for the u21s. Doesn’t feel a natural fit for Dycheball if that’s what Forest see-saw into next.",
      "88) Eddie Nketiah – hasn’t really done much for Palace, but it’s probably a little hard when Mateta is an imperious first choice. Still, as with a few on this list if he puts a run of goals together, there may be a squad spot for the taking.",
      "89) Ryan Sessegnon – has been deputising ably for Antonee Robinson and it’s great to see him back to fitness and form, however it’s hard to see how that translates into becoming an England player.",
      "90) Anthony Patterson – haven’t named a goalkeeper in the above. I’d like to have done so but couldn’t think of one. Patterson isn’t even number one at Sunderland. Where have all the good English keepers gone?",

      "There are allegations and counter-allegations about the nature of the supporters’ behaviour in Amsterdam, but it seems that Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were in some cases the victims of racially-motivated abuse and violence, but also, and this is not denied by anyone, also the perpetrators of racially-motivated abuse and violence.",
      "You can have an opinion about whether or not Israeli clubs should be banned from international sporting competition (for the record, there’s a fairly compelling case that Israel have repeatedly violated FIFA and UEFA statutes, and there is the clear precedent of Russia who have been suspended from international competition following their invasion of Ukraine) and you can have an opinion about whether or not this decision is particularly risk-averse, but linking this, as both the Prime Minister and LOTO have, with anti-semitism is prima facie absurd, and actually quite dangerous.",
      "If supporters of an English football club rioted in another European City, and a subsequent European city’s authorities decided that they couldn’t be doing with them, then I don’t believe that the Prime Minister or Leader Of The Opposition would have anything to say about it at all. So why are they making a stand on behalf of supporters of a club from another nation?",
      "Maybe it’s the politicians who should be keeping politics out of football, not footballers past or present?\nDara O’Reilly, London",
      "",
      "Apologies for this, but I need to put my thoughts across on another instance of politics crossing into football so please feel free to stop reading at this point if you’re not interested or cba with it all.",
      "Yesterday my club Aston Villa put out a statement to say that on the advice of the Safety Advisory Group, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv would not be allowed to attend our match with them in the Europa League on 6th November.  As someone who will be attending the match myself, I welcomed this decision on the basis that it has been made on safety grounds – for those that have never been to Aston, it is a heavily Asian populated area with quite a few mosques so the introduction of a set of fans who have previously been known for racist and aggressive behaviour abroad doesn’t require a lot of mental gymnastics to see how this has got the potential to be a very dangerous situation.  For anyone that isn’t aware, this makes for some very interesting reading.",
      "Now we have various politicians including our very own prime minister chipping in to say that the decision is wrong and “antisemetic” – but is it? Antisemitism is defined as “prejudice or hatred against Jewish people, which can manifest as hostile actions or rhetoric toward individuals, their property, or Jewish community institutions”.  I’m pretty confident in saying that this decision wasn’t taken based on the fact that Maccabi fans are Jewish but instead that a number of their fans are savages that can’t control themselves.  Yes you can station more police at Villa Park but what’s going to happen to the people who live in the surrounding area? How are you going to police every nearby street to ensure public safety? Whether you agree with it or not, there are more than a few houses with Palestine flags hanging from the windows in Aston – how do you see this playing out if/when Maccabi fans on their way to the ground walk past?",
      "To those that say “banning all fans is unfair to those who just want to support their team”, I don’t disagree with you but the moronic element don’t exactly wear badges or uniforms so what else do you do? Matches behind closed doors is one option, but then you’d have to do that for every game Maccabi play in Europe so why even take part?",
      "I honestly and truly believe that this decision has been made in the interests of public safety and for no other reason.  As I type this email, the government are “trying to find a way to reverse the ban” – assuming they are successful in doing so, I expect each and every one of them to be back on TV the following morning to be held responsible for making it happen and the carnage that will undoubtedly follow, which of course they won’t.  This is the equivalent of holding a lit match over a bucket of petrol, it’s really not going to end well at all.\nJeff G, West Brom Villan (Wondering how many of these politicians will be at Villa Park to see the match in person….)",
      "",
      "With the news that the West Midlands Police have decided that no Maccabi Tel Aviv fans will be allowed to attend the Europa league match against Aston Villa for safety concerns, has football now got a major antisemitism problem?",
      "Regardless of your thoughts on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and beyond, football is supposed to be a way to unite and bring happiness to the masses. As a football website I won’t delve into the complexities of the terrible conflict.",

      "In a country where we debate microaggressions and perceived threat of a national flag, where does actually being barred from attending football sit? As we all know it starts with antisemitism (Jews being the smallest of minorities in England circa 300k) and then other groups will be next…",

      "The winger was deemed surplus to requirements at Man Utd after falling out with Amorim, who reportedly informed him to ‘find a new club’ after the Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Garnacho was criticised for his poor form and attitude at Man Utd, while he struggled to adapt as Amorim implemented his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Last month, the 21-year-old received a poor reception as Chelsea faced Man Utd at Old Trafford. The Red Devils won 2-1 as the Blues played most of the game with ten men due to Robert Sanchez’s early red card, though Casemiro was later dismissed to level the playing field.",
      "READ: Mbeumo probably furious after ‘secret’ – and also completely pointless – Manchester United mission leaked",
      "Now, Garnacho has commented on Chelsea’s start to this season and claimed that they have had “bad luck with red cards”. He has also claimed that they would have beaten Man Utd if Sanchez didn’t get sent off.",
      "“It’s a hard moment for them [Forest] but you never know in football,” Garnacho said in an interview for Chelsea’s official website.",
      "“They may not have been winning games but they have good players and will want to win. We have to be ready.",
      "“We are in a good position in the league [five points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal], especially after we had a little bit of bad luck with red cards.",
      "“For example, the game against Brighton, we should win that game. And the game at United, if we play 11 against 11, I feel we would be on top.",
      "“But we are okay. I think it’s important to build from the last win against Liverpool and try to win again to be up there.",
      "“I think we have a team that can fight in the league and for the rest of the trophies, and we want to try to win at least one trophy. Because of the moment of the team, of the club, I think we can fight for the big trophies. It’s the dream we have.”",
      "In another recent interview, Garnacho broke his silence on how Amorim treated him at Man Utd.",
      "“I think it was a difficult moment there, just training alone. But I have nothing bad to say about the club, my old club Manchester United,” Garnacho admitted.",

      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",
      "There has been significant upheaval at Man Utd over the past couple of years as INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "At the start of 2024, Ratcliffe fended off competition from Qatari businessman Sheikh Jassim to purchase a 27.7% minority stake in the Premier League giants for around £1.25bn.",
      "Ratcliffe sanctioned this deal with a view to a full takeover in the future and has since invested more cash to raise his share to around 29%.",
      "The Glazer family still owns most of Man Utd, but they have moved to the background as Ratcliffe and his team have taken over the day-to-day running of the club.",
      "This has suited the Glazer family, as Ratcliffe has taken the heat for his controversial decisions over the past couple of years. His popularity has quickly waned as he’s sanctioned a brutal cost-cutting programme, making staff redundant, reducing payments to club legends and hiking ticket prices.",
      "READ: Amorim will sacrifice three academy kids ‘on the cheap’ to Newcastle after Ratcliffe pop",
      "Ratcliffe has also hatched a plan to build a new stadium for Man Utd, but it has recently been claimed that he could be forced out of the club.",

      "This week, it has been claimed that this group have ‘approached’ Man Utd legends over joining their attempts to buy the club, while the terms of a potential deal have also reportedly been set.",
      "Now, a respected account on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ has provided a new update.",
      "They tweeted: ‘According to our sources: A consortium based in the United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪 initial talks has been rejected by @ManUtd.",
      "‘Formal approach made in the last 24 hours. They believe talks can be restarted. David Beckham could be very key to get talks started. UAE are serious.’",
      "Earlier this week, football finance expert Kieran Maguire explained why there has been a “false flag” amid speculation of a possible takeover.",
      "Maguire claimed: “I think if the Glazers had wanted to sell at $32 per share for the whole club, then they would have done so.",
      "“The fact that nothing has taken place speaks for itself. Yes, the share price has risen and I’ve been monitoring it myself.",
      "“We’re still at $16, $17, and even that includes a speculative element to it.",
      "“So the comments from Turki Al-Sheikh are intriguing, but the club has responded with a fairly heavy ‘no’, and given that it’s listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it’s got to be cautious about what it says publicly.",
      "“So I think it’s a bit of a false flag that we’re seeing. If somebody wanted to get involved in a bid then Twitter’s not the best place to put out that information.",
      "“So you do wonder about the motives of some of the people involved.”",

      "As per the report, Mancini has ‘told friends’ that he ‘could be a shock contender to replace Amorim if Man Utd decide to sack him’.",
      "This is said to be for two main reasons, as he’s already ‘met’ with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his ‘CV remains impressive’.",

      "‘And his CV remains impressive – as well as his trophies at the Etihad, he also led Italy to Euro 2020 glory at the expense of England.’",
      "Recently, Ratcliffe boldly claimed that Amorim would be given three years to prove himself at Man Utd, but the head coach played down these claims during his press conference on Friday.",
      "Amorim said: “He tells me all the time, sometimes with a message after games. But you know, I know and Jim knows that football is not like that. The most important thing is the next game, you cannot control, even with owners, you cannot control the next day in football.",
      "“So I know that, but it’s really good to hear that also because of the noise, but Omar (Berrada, chief executive) and Jason (Wilcox, director of football) tell me that all the time.",
      "“First of all, I can feel (the support). It’s not just that thing that people talk about. But I feel it every day. And again, sometimes the pressure that I put on the team or on myself is so much bigger than them.",
      "“I know that it’s going to take a while, but I don’t want to think like that. I said that last year. But of course again, it’s really good to hear that. I think it helps our fans to understand that leadership is going to take a while. But at the same moment, I don’t like that, because it will give a feeling that we have time to work things out.",
      "“So I don’t want that feeling here in our club. Again, the most important thing is the next game. It’s good to feel the support, but we need to prove in football and especially in big clubs that every weekend we are ready to win games.”",
      "Jamie Redknapp thinks “any manager in any league in England” could win back-to-back matches with Ruben Amorim’s current Man Utd side.",

      "🔴 Amorim's system could trouble Liverpool💪 Merino showing his value to Arsenal🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Ruben Amorim's system continues to dominate the discourse around Manchester United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw but it might just work in his side's favour when they face Liverpool on Super Sunday.",
      "Arne Slot's side, on an uncharacteristic run of three consecutive defeats, tend to find playing against back threes more difficult.",
      "The issue has been most apparent against Crystal Palace, one of few other Premier League sides who habitually deploy a back three. Liverpool are winless in three games against them if you throw in the penalty-shootout defeat in the Community Shield in August.",
      "Even the five Premier League games Liverpool have won against back threes since the start of last season, away at Crystal Palace, Southampton and Burnley and at home against Wolves and West Ham, have been nervy affairs settled by one-goal margins.",
      "Manchester United have of course caused problems for Slot's side too, securing a 2-2 draw on their last visit to Anfield in January, when they used their wing-backs to create overloads in wide areas in a performance described by Gary Neville as their best under Amorim.",
      "They will return to Anfield as underdogs on Sunday. Amazingly, Manchester United are yet to win back-to-back Premier League games under Amorim. But their last visit offers a blueprint to follow and they typically fare better in these kinds of assignments.",
      "In fact, in Premier League games in which they have had less possession than their opponent under Amorim, Manchester United's win rate is nearly twice as high as when they have had more, while their loss rate drops from 64 per cent to 25 per cent.",
      "The numbers are of course influenced to some extent by game-state. A team holding a lead is more likely to relinquish possession, just as a team trailing is more likely to have more of it as they try to open their opponent up and find a way back into the game.",
      "But the trend is not unique to Manchester United.",
      "Since the start of last season, Premier League sides using back threes have had less possession, on average, in games they have won and drawn compared to the games they have lost.",
      "It supports the argument that a back three is a reactive system, and at its most effective, at least in most cases, when used as a means to absorb pressure and spring forward quickly using transitions.",
      "Whether it is the right approach for a club of Manchester United's stature in the long-term is debateable. On Sunday against Liverpool, though, it probably offers their best hope of getting a result.",
      "The 29-year-old made it six goals in four appearances for Spain with his double against Bulgaria on Tuesday. Only Erling Haaland and Memphis Depay have scored more times in European World Cup qualifying. Merino's tally is equal to Harry Kane's.",
      "His eye for goal is not new. Merino has scored 16 times in 35 games for club and country since his late double in Arsenal's 2-0 win over Leicester in February, when he was pressed into the role of striker for the first time following an injury to Kai Havertz.",
      "The positional change proved transformative for Merino, who had never previously played up front. But his goals for Spain have come from midfield and so did his latest for Arsenal, the headed equaliser in the late victory over Newcastle at St James' Park.",
      "Merino excels at timing his runs into the box. \"He can smell danger,\" said Mikel Arteta in February. But his extraordinary aerial threat, showcased again with his headed double against Bulgaria, is not his only weapon when it comes to finishing scoring chances.",
      "Spain's Luis de la Fuente uses the same term. \"He is so complete, we are lucky to have him,\" he said. Merino's value to Arteta is similarly clear. But it is fair to say perceptions externally are not universally positive. He continues to be mischaracterised as a defensive player, his selection seen by some as a symbol of conservatism.",
      "Merino is not a fleet-footed creator in the mould of Eberechi Eze or Martin Odegaard, that is true. But he would not be starting every game for Spain if he lacked technical ability and his off-the-ball qualities are invaluable in pressing opponents high up the pitch.",
      "Goals are of course the most important currency of all and, in Merino's case, it is worth noting context as well as volume.",
      "He counts Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle, Real Madrid, France and Netherlands among the teams he has scored against over the last eight months. His eight Premier League goals have won Arsenal twice as many points as any other player's.",
      "It all adds up to make him vitally important to both club and country, despite fierce competition for places on both fronts. It would be no surprise to see him show his value again at Craven Cottage.",
      "Donyell Malen was Aston Villa's match-winner as his double clinched a 2-1 victory over Burnley in their last game and he added another goal for Netherlands during the international break.",
      "He has had to be patient since arriving at Villa from Borussia Dortmund in January but looks ready to belatedly make his mark in the Premier League with Spurs next up on Sunday.",
      "Last week's column examined Mohamed Salah's dip for Liverpool and why he's missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. There was also a look at Arsenal's formidable defensive numbers this season and Graham Potter's unceremonious end at West Ham.",
