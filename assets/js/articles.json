      "Antony has been told his future will be best served away from Manchester United despite his resurgence on loan at Real Betis. However, Gary Pallister believes the Brazilian has at least one attribute Ruben Amorim would be better off keeping around.",
      "The Manchester misfit's tenacity could be something Sporting CP boss Amorim would appreciate if combined with more output on the field. Yet despite Antony's efforts to reinvent himself during his loan spell in Spain, it appears it might not be sufficient to secure his career in England.",
      "Red Devils legend Pallister has suggested the out-of-favour winger has fallen prey to his own playing style at United. When Antony was loaned out in the January transfer window, his £82million fee made him arguably one of the worst signings in United's history.",
      "Coming from Ajax on the back of Erik ten Hag's recommendation in the summer of 2022, the player shouldered immense expectations. However, he only managed 17 direct goal contributions (12 goals and five assists) in 96 appearances for United before being shipped off to La Liga.",
      "In stark contrast, he’s nearly matched those figures with eight goals and five assists in just 22 games for Betis. Despite his impressive stats abroad, Pallister has said it's not Antony's mental toughness that's in question among United's loanees.",
      "\"I think Antony is probably better suited to the football that he's playing out in Spain. I liked his attitude when he was here and I know he got a bit of stick, but he was always game, he was always up for a fight.",
      "\"It didn't really work from him here. Some people are better attuned to the foreign kind of football rather than the Premier League.\"",
      "Many supporters might share this same view, considering what they saw of the player during his time in England to date. Now under ex-Man City chief Manuel Pellegrini, he's become an integral part of the team and has helped push Los Verdiblancos towards a Europa Conference League final.",
      "Yet the winger often seemed baffled by Premier League defences. Antony's overreliance on his left boot often led to ineffective displays, and his numbers failed to improve once Amorim took over in November.",
      "It's fortunate for United they have Amad Diallo as an established alternative for the right flank. The Ivorian has been hitting his stride at United over the past year or so, having had his own struggles for prominence at Old Trafford.",
      "United now face the conundrum of deciding their terms to let Antony go given his market value has nosedived since moving from Amsterdam. It's believed United have already snubbed one Betis bid to buy him outright, which implies the sum offered doesn't square with their price expectations.",
      "United are reportedly asking for £40m to part ways with the player, almost half of what they originally shelled out nearly three years ago. The star has expressed his fondness for his current club, telling Mundo Deportivo moving to Seville was \"the best decision\" he's ever made.",
      "Betis' financial scope this summer will depend largely on their ability to clinch a spot in next season's Champions League. Pellegrini's team must secure a place in the top five of La Liga to make the cut, currently sitting just shy in sixth place and trailing by three points."

      "Not only does it represent a golden chance for each side to secure silverware, it also gives the teams an opportunity to seal a Champions League place. That would be particularly important given the rotten seasons that both United and Spurs have been enduring.",
      "United sit 16th with just ten wins and 39 points throughout the campaign, while the North London side are one point and a place lower after 20 league losses. Despite that, United icon Neville believes Spurs would dominate when it comes to selecting the best players in each side - only Portuguese playmaker Bruno Fernandes earning a spot for the Red Devils.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, he said: “I've genuinely got a sickly feeling about this game next Wednesday. The biggest reason is when I look at every single player in the Tottenham team, when you look at (Dejan) Kulusevski, Son (Heung-min), Brennan Johnson, (Dominic) Solanke, if (James) Maddison was there, (Yves) Bissouma and (Pape Matar) Sarr, (Cristian) Romero and (Micky) Van de Ven, (Pedro) Porro and (Destiny) Udogie, when you look at those players, like-for-like with United's, only Bruno (Fernandes) would get into the first 11 of Spurs.",
      "“I would select every single Tottenham player. The goalkeeper is a 50-50 split because I don't like (Guglielmo) Vicario and I'm not a fan of (Andre) Onana.",
      "“Honestly, Udogie, Porro, Van de Ven, Romero, Bissouma, Sarr, Johnson, Maddison, Solanke, Kulusevski, Son, I would choose every single player of Tottenham's over Manchester United's next Wednesday. That's my worry.",
      "“The one thing that keeps me alive - the likes of a Casemiro, a Bruno, they've got something in them that will step up for a one-off game that means I think that we'll win. But if the players play as they should do, pound-for-pound, Tottenham should win that game.”",
      "Both Spurs and Man United have a Premier League game to play out ahead of the Europa League final in Bilbao next week. United take on Chelsea on Friday evening, with Spurs in action on the same night against Aston Villa.",
      "Who will win the Europa League final? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "The pair are also set to go in different directions when it comes to their potential celebrations. The North London side will host a parade should they claim their first trophy since 2008 but United will not follow suit, with a barbeque at Carrington provisionally planned for players, staff and families."

      "The club's season rests on the result in northern Spain, with victory providing salvation in the form of a place in next season's Champions League. United are 16th in the Premier League, a place above Spurs, following the 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Sunday and are fully focused on the Europa League final.",
      "The West Ham game extended their winless run in the league to seven games and brought another bitter pill to swallow in the form of another injury for Leny Yoro. The French defender received treatment on the pitch at Old Trafford in the second half and had to be replaced by Harry Maguire.",
      "\"We have to assess Leny in a better way tomorrow,\" Amorim said after the match. \"He felt something, but it could be a small thing.\"",
      "He was due to undergo a scan to determine the extent of the issue and was conspicuous by his absence at an opening training session at Carrington on Wednesday morning. Amorim could be sweating on other injuries, too, with Diogo Dalot, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven also not presence in the session.",
      "Dalot suffered a calf injury in the 1-0 defeat by Wolves last month and appears very unlikely to make the Spurs game. \"He has something in his muscle, his calf, he had a sequence of games, he played all the time, we try to manage but the players play a lot of minutes and not so ready to cope with that. Dalot felt something,\" Amorim said. \"We don't know how long he's going to be out. But he's out for these next games.\"",
      "De Ligt picked up a knee injury in the 4-3 loss to Brentford, but Amorim had been optimistic about a swift return. \"It is not a big issue,\" he said. \"That is a good thing. He cannot play tomorrow [vs Athletic Bilbao] and he'll not play on Sunday [vs West Ham] but then we'll check day by day.\"",
      "Heaven has not been involved in any squads since being on the bench against Newcastle on April 13 due to a \"small setback\".",
      "Injuries have been a major problem for Amorim during his debut campaign as United boss, with defence a particular issue. Maguire, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui all featured against West Ham, but United are short on numbers in defence.",
      "Amorim chose to play a strong side against the Hammers on Sunday, with Bruno Fernandes partnering Manuel Ugarte in midfield. The Portuguese boss admitted that he still had one eye on the Europa League final and had to manage his squad ahead of Friday's trip to play Chelsea in the Premier League.",
      "\"We want to win and to be competitive, also in the Premier League,\" Amorim said. \"Bruno doesn't have the problem of any injury [touches wood] but Harry [Maguire] has. So we have to manage that but they have to play and it is better to play than to stay out.\""

      "In a dream world where that change progresses quickly this summer, United would look totally different from this season's under-performers. That change would start in goal, where Andre Onana has been desperately disappointing.",
      "Lille star Lucas Chevalier has emerged as a target, having helped his side to likely European qualification and broken into the France national team squad this season. With two years on his contract, Chevalier is available for around £33.7million.",

      "Ratcliffe has continued to defend the decisions he's taken, which include increasing ticket prices and ridding of concession fees. He said on The Overlap: \"Change requires some unpopular decisions. I think I have to accept that I'm going to be unpopular. I don't know how long I'm going to be unpopular, maybe I'll be unpopular for a long period time.",
      "\"But I think it's worth being unpopular to fight our way through the changes that are necessary to get Manchester United back to where it should be and hopefully the attitude will change a bit if we come out the other side with a successful outcome.\""

      "A little over a decade ago, a fresh-faced Tyler Blackett stepped onto the Old Trafford pitch for his Manchester United debut. At 31, the central defender now finds himself at a crossroads - clubless and without a competitive game in over a year since Rotherham United released him at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Once hailed as a future Red Devils defensive cornerstone, Blackett forged a solid Championship career after failing to make the grade at United. But his current limbo paints a stark contrast to the promise of his youth.",
      "\"How I've been? Okay,\" Blackett told Flashscore earlier this year. \"It's not been easy by any means, it's something which I've not had to deal with in my career before. Some days better than others.",
      "\"But I'm just getting through - staying fit and training. Just keeping on top of things and doing what I can do to be ready when the right opportunity comes. It's about waiting for the right fit now.\"",
      "Blackett’s journey began at eight when he joined United, his boyhood club, dreaming of emulating defensive titans Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. He rose swiftly through the academy, his blend of physicality and composure catching the eye.",
      "In 2014, with Ferdinand and Vidic both departing, a door cracked open. New manager Louis van Gaal, impressed by Blackett’s pre-season showings, fast-tracked him to the senior squad.",
      "\"Van Gaal was great for me,\" Blackett said. \"He obviously had trust in young players and gave you that confidence by giving those outlines and what he expected from you.",
      "\"That's what you had to focus on, and that helped me at that time. He was a manager who gave me an opportunity, and I have always praised him and thanked him for that.\"",
      "Blackett made 12 senior appearances in Van Gaal’s first season, showing flashes of his potential. In 2015, when he signed a new contract, Van Gaal doubled down on his belief.",
      "“Tyler has great potential and I believe he is at the right club to continue his development and progression to become a great defender,” the Dutchman said. The words carried weight, fuelling optimism that Blackett could be United’s next homegrown star.",
      "A loan move to Celtic was sorted the following season, with hopes Blackett could get some high-level, regular football under his belt, before coming back to fight for a place in United's starting XI. Instead, the move backfired.",
      "Blackett languished on the bench or was used out of position at left-back, sapping his confidence and rhythm. He returned to Manchester a shadow of the player who’d left.",
      "The arrival of Jose Mourinho in 2016 sealed Blackett's fate. Unlike Van Gaal, Mourinho showed little faith in the young defender, allowing him to join Reading without a single sniff of first-team action. Blackett’s United dream was over.",
      "It was in Berkshire, as well as during later stints at Nottingham Forest and in the MLS with FC Cincinnati, that he showed glimpses of his old promise, albeit largely struggling for consistency once again.",
      "In 2023, Blackett signed with Rotherham. He made 23 appearances in the 2023/24 season, offering stability to a side battling relegation. But the Millers' struggles culminated in a drop to League One, and Blackett was released, leaving him without a club for the first time in his professional career.",
      "His time in Yorkshire, while steady, underscored a career that never quite recaptured the heights of his United days. Under Van Gaal, he stood on the cusp of greatness - a homegrown talent with the tools to succeed at the highest level. But football is unforgiving.",
      "Loans that falter, managerial changes, and fleeting confidence can derail even the brightest prospects. Blackett’s 12 appearances for United remain a fleeting highlight in a career that, while respectable, never matched the lofty expectations set in 2014. As he trains alone, awaiting the “right fit,” Blackett’s story serves as a poignant reminder of how fine the margins are in the beautiful game."

A top six finish would be good enough for European football, but it would also represent one of the rarest revivals in Premier League history.",

That owed to a managerial change with David O'Leary coming in to replace Graham Taylor. That was an example of a new manager bounce really lifting a club as they landed UEFA Cup - now Europa League - qualification.",

As like Hodgson, Moyes was able to turnaround the club's fortunes after a proper pre-season and the chance to bring in his own players.",

When you look at the club's entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved."

      "It's only a matter of time before Xabi Alonso is confirmed as the next Real Madrid manager after announcing he would be leaving Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The Spaniard will have huge plans about who will be in his team at the Bernabeu as he looks to help them bounce back from a barren season.",
      "Alonso is one of the most highly-rated young managers in football and stands to inherit a star-studded team featuring stars like Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr, but he will have idea of which areas he wants to strengthen too.",
      "Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has already been confirmed as the next Brazil boss and is should be only a matter of time before Alonso gets to work at his former club. He should only need a handful of signings to get his new side back in fighting condition for trophies again and it won't be long before he starts identifying those targets.",
      "Thibaut Courtois is the undisputed No 1 in goal and that won't change under Alonso, but he might need to start thinking about how his defence might look. Madrid have some ageing centre-backs, with Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba both aged 32, but they still have enough quality to star next season.",
      "Eder Militao will also hope to get in the team under Alonso but Los Blancos' new boss will want at least one new centre-back who can compete for a place and add much-needed competition.",
      "Jonathan Tah was a favourite of Alonso's at Leverkusen and he fancies taking the centre-half to Madrid with him, according to Spanish outlet AS. The commanding 29-year-old is in demand, though, and has also been linked with Manchester United.",
      "The German is available on a free transfer and would be a huge coup. But with Bayern Munich also sniffing around, a deal may not be as straightforward as it seems.",
      "While Trent Alexander-Arnold will consider himself as a defender, he is expected to operate between defence and midfield in Alonso's back three and play more as an attacking wing-back that will get forward and cause problems down the flanks.",
      "The England international's move is yet to be confirmed but is a formality after confirmation he will leave Liverpool this summer on a free transfer. It's believe Madrid are hoping to get Alexander-Arnold over the line before they depart for the Club World Cup.",
      "On the opposite flank, Alonso is said to want another left wing-back, especially after Ferland Mendy was ruled out with a serious muscle injury and is unlikely to be back before said tournament starts next month.",
      "Alonso could, then, launch another raid on Leverkusen for Alex Grimaldo, who has been superb across the last two seasons. He registered seven assists in the Bundesliga this season and had 13 last season, in addition to 10 goals.",
      "In the middle of the park, Federico Valverde is likely to be the automatic starter, but with Luka Modric approaching the end of his contract, Alonso will want a younger midfielder he can depend on for years to come. Martin Zubimendi has been strongly linked with Arsenal, but is also on Alonso's wishlist and the player may prefer to stay in Spain at one of the country's top clubs rather than join the Premier League.",
      "Find a way to accommodate both Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe will be a complex problem for any manager in football to solve but Madrid's attack practically picks itself. Alonso might find himself shoehorned into playing both Vinicius and Mbappe up front, with Bellingham playing just off them in the No 10 role, unless he opts to play the former two as wingers and buy a new forward.",
      "It will should become a real dilemma as superstar Mbappe will want to be the focal point up front, but Alonso may soon come to realise why Ancelotti had so many issues getting his squad to gel as a unit this season - and perhaps he'll see that the balance is wrong with Mbappe as the lone striker."

      "United’s players have been allocated two tickets each, but family and friends who do make the trip will do so at their own cost, with INEOS refusing to pay for their travel. It is the continuation of a strong theme of the Ratcliffe era, with a barbecue reportedly planned instead of a parade if they win in Bilbao.",
      "The 72-year-old, who has a personal wealth of £12.3billion according to Forbes, has made headlines for making what he believes are unpopular but necessary cuts at United. He has cancelled the Christmas party, reduced ticket allocations and benefits for the FA Cup final and made hundreds of staff redundant.",
      "With United sitting 16th in the Premier League following their 2-0 defeat by West Ham on Sunday, the club have cancelled their end-of-season awards dinner at Old Trafford. That decision is understood to have been taken due to the lack of success on the pitch, rather than to save money, but it is indicative of the direction of travel under Ratcliffe’s stewardship.",
      "\"Manchester United has become mediocre,\" Ratcliffe said earlier in the season. \"It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.",
      "\"I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.\""

      "Manchester United have cancelled the club's end of season awards dinner after the dismal performance of the men's team.",
      "Traditionally United hold a huge gala dinner at Old Trafford for the men's, women's and youth teams at the end of each campaign, with awards handed out to the best performers of the season, including the Sir Matt Busby player of the year gong.",
      "But with Ruben Amorim's flops down in 16th place in the Premier League, it has been decided that an awards night is not appropriate this time around, despite United taking part in the Europa League final against Tottenham next Wednesday.",
      "United's women finished third in the WSL, qualifying for the Champions League, while United's youngsters finished fifth in Premier League 2 and their under 18s finished second in their league.",
      "Instead of the dinner it is expected that the awards will be handed out on the Old Trafford pitch prior to the club's final Premier League game of the season at home to Aston Villa.",
      "Skipper Bruno Fernandes is the overwhelming favourite for the player of the year award, which he could win for a record-equalling fourth time.",
      "It is the third time in the last four seasons that a planned dinner has been cancelled, with United also feeling it wasn't appropriate to hold it after Erik ten Hag's side finished eighth in the league last season. They did however then go on to win the FA Cup.",
      "The players also opted to cancel the dinner at the end of the 2021-22 season, when they finished sixth with 58 points in a campaign which saw the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "United have just 39 points from their 36 Premier League games this season having suffered 17 defeats. They are guaranteed to finish in their lowest position in Premier League history, with Amorim repeatedly criticising his squad since he arrived as Ten Hag's replacement in November.",
      "A report from The Times also states that internally the idea of a lavish dinner would not go down well after United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe embarked on a ruthless cost-cutting drive this year, reducing staff numbers by around 400.",
      "United are also due to head to Malaysia for a post-season friendly tour immediately after the Villa game on May 25.",
      "They are hoping to bank around £8m from matches against an Asian All-Star XI and a Hong Kong XI."

      "Manchester United intend to retain Ruben Amorim this summer - even if they lose the Europa League final. The Portuguese coach has presided over a horrendous Premier League campaign which has led to questions over his future.",
      "The team have performed well below par and will register their worst top flight finish for decades, but have been able to up their game on the European stage. They've seen off the likes of Lyon and Athletic Bilbao and will now play in the final against Tottenham next week.",
      "Victory offers a route into the Champions League, but even a defeat won't change the stance of the United hierarchy. They believe that Amorim cannot properly be judged until he's had a transfer window to bring in players who suit his unique system, reports The Guardian.",
      "Amorim has stuck defiantly to his philosophy since arriving in Manchester to replace Erik ten Hag in November. He's managed just six Premier League wins in that time, which has seen the team fall to 16th. After their loss against West Ham on Sunday the head coach appeared to question his own credentials.",
      "He said: \"It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons\". Amorim has also questioned whether the Red Devils should compete in the Champions League.",
      "The United hierarchy, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have owned up to their error after retaining Ten Hag last summer despite months of poor results. The Dutchman was handed a new deal, backed in the summer, but then sacked shortly after.",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system bought huge success in Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles, but it hasn't led to an upturn in results in Manchester. The club have had to endure several embarrassing home defeats with a number of players continuing to underwhelm.",
      "With the exception of Bruno Fernandes nearly the entire United squad is struggling to match expectations. As a result nearly the entire squad is up for sale with the Manchester outfit prepared to listen to a number of offers. More worryingly is the return to form of Marcus Rashford and Antony - two men who were struggling only to rediscover top form out on loan.",
      "Amorim will certainly need to bolster his resources out wide in the summer, bringing in individuals capable of playing as wing-backs. More firepower is also a priority with United's frontmen struggling for goals, which has led to links with the likes of Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap."

      "De Ligt has missed the last two games with a knee injury and Yoro limped off during the second half of Sunday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United at Old Trafford. He was later seen leaving the stadium limping, but without the need for a protective boot.",

      "That concludes Ruben Amorim's pre-Europa League final press conference ahead of next week's clash with Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao.",

The feeling will be like 'what a waste of time' [if they lose]. My message to my players will be that we need to win it, otherwise it doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"We give all the information that we can and we prepare the game in the same way. It is the only way I know how. It is a thing of our players also. They have proven in the past, in these types of games, they are prepared to do that.\"",
      "\"No, no, I will not sing it - they don't deserve that! The feeling would be really good because I would feel as though I have given something to this club. It would be a really good feeling to give back to the fans. But again, I think I need to prove a lot more to have the right to a song.\"",
      "\"It is hard to have a message. You can see it every Sunday here. They are always supporting the team. I think we have lost nine games at home this season. They are always supporting the manager, so I have nothing to say. The connection with the supporters is really important. It can be a game-changer. We want to build that connection and win titles.\"",
      "\"It is going to be really bad. I don't want to use that as an excuse. It is going to be really tough. The patience of you guys [the media] and the fans is going to be on the limit. We have to be perfect to continue everything.\"",
      "\"We need more time with the team to arrange a lot of things at Carrington, where we are not thinking by game, by game, by game. We have proven this year that we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and be really competitive in the Premier League. It is going to be tough.\"",
      "\"I didn't speak with him. Again, it would be massive for us to win something and give something to the fans. It is not important if I follow Jose Mourinho or another manager. The most important thing is how this title could help us get back to the top, fast.\"",
      "\"It is going to be different. We are prepared for that and the final is completely different. The context is different. This team has proven already that in a final they can step up.\"",
      "\"Personally for me, I think the Champions League is more important for everything, to prepare the next season. We are supposed to be in the Champions League; the Europa League here is not enough. This is the best way to get us to the top in a few years.\"",
      "\"Since I arrived here, I have always been talking about the standards. I have a clear idea what to do. I understand the problems of the team, so I am far from quitting. What I am saying is, we need to perform in the future and this season. If not, they will change us, that is a normal thing. That was my feeling and is still my feeling today.\"",
      "\"A final is different. But this season has been really tough on everybody; the results and the changing in the staff. You can feel it. We are addressing that during the season, we are changing the way we play during the season, so the environment is tough. But I guarantee you when we are playing a game in the Europa League the environment is different and you can feel the excitement.\"",
      "\"To start with that, the situation is simple: we know that we have had a lot of things with people leaving and changes in the staff. In this moment, in our club, sometimes it is hard when to give, when to take. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff. It is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment was to help. It is not going to change my life. To help the staff to be there... to be better staff for the final. All the players had the same reaction. Everyone wants the staff there, their families there. It is hard to manage things in our club, so it is a simple thing.\"",
      "\"Dalot is trying really bad. I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, a second injury, it is a big thing. We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad. We will see. He is working really hard to get in the final.\"",
      "\"I don't know if they are going to be available. We are going to try and push because it is the final matches and there is a final. All the players want to play in that really bad. I don't think they will go to Chelsea, but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.\"",

      "Sixteenth-placed United are certain to record at least their joint-lowest top flight finish of 13th since they were relegated in 1974. Their remaining fixtures are against Chelsea and Aston Villa, fifth and sixth in the table and on the same number of points as they attempt to secure Champions League qualification.",
      "The United head coach Ruben Amorim stressed on Sunday the club must be \"really strong in the summer and be brave\" after a 17th league defeat of the campaign to West Ham United.",
      "\"Everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here,\" Amorim said. \"Everybody is thinking about the (Europa League) final, the final is not an issue in this moment in our club, we have bigger things to think about and we have to change a lot of things at the end of the season.\""

      "It appears that work is already being ramped up ahead of next season with Ruben Amorim looking to strengthen his side to eradicate the nightmares of a turgid Premier League campaign at Old Trafford.",

      "I don't know if they are going to be available. We are going to try and push because it is the final matches and there is a final. All the players want to play in that really bad. I don't think they will go to Chelsea, but we will have a possibility to have some of them in the final.",
      "On Dalot, he added:",
      "Dalot is trying really bad. I don't want to risk Dalot because when you start getting one injury, a second injury, it is a big thing. We cannot have these kinds of problems in our squad. We will see. He is working really hard to get in the final.",
      "He may not be the 'biggest' name on the market but his goalscoring prowess in recent seasons means he cannot be overlooked.",
      "109 goals in 231 appearances is a respectable return and at 25 he holds plenty of resale value.",
      "What's more, on a free, he is ideal for a cash-strapped side.",

I know it hasn't always been easy but I hope that my goals and my celebrations have managed to bring you some joy.

Thank you very much for everything you have given me personally over the years.",
      "According to Turkish media outlet Yeni Asir, former United boss Jose Mourinho is planning to swoop in for Jadon Sancho in the summer.",

      "Chelsea and United agreed a £25m buy clause when his loan switch was agreed last summer but the Blues can pay a £5m penalty to not sign him permanently.",
      "If that decision is made, it is believed that Mourinho would be keen to swoop in for the winger.",

      "\"I think [Marcus] Rashford's gonna be hungry. It's not great that [Rasmus] Hojlund's injured for the start of the season, again, but I think sometimes it helps them to play with pace on the counterattack with Rashford, [Alejandro] Garnacho and Amad as well. So I'm gonna say fourth for United this season.\"",
      "Who would have thought that Rashford would now be as good as gone, United look destined for 16th and Champions League football for next season would still be on the cards - but thanks to the Europa League? Well he may not have predicted it to the letter but one pundit did manage to foresee the Reds having a worse season than many were anticipating.",
      "\"I think the very best they can do is fourth,\" Paul Scholes told The Overlap’s Fan Debate. \"I’ve heard a lot of Manchester United fans say how excited they are for the new season; I’m struggling to get excited for it.",
      "\"I think we will struggle to do as well as Liverpool, as much as I would like it to be the other way around. United have too many issues at this point to get anywhere near them.\"",
      "Scholes may come across as pessimistic at times but on this occasion there was good reason for it. He was right to not be excited for this season and he was bang on that United would get nowhere near Liverpool.",
      "That latter statement was more controversial considering Jurgen Klopp's departure and the question marks surrounding Arne Slot - not to mention the lack of money spent in the summer. And yet, Slot stunned everyone to win the Premier League and leave United looking on enviously.",
      "Despite all that has happened, United could still finish the season only slightly worse in terms of sporting achievement if they win the Europa League. They go into the final as slight favourites thanks to their history compared to Tottenham Hotspur and United have also shown they are a different beast in the Europa League.",
      "They also had the trickier route to the final which makes them fancied greater than Spurs. Whatever the outcome in Bilbao a week today, the only certainty will be to follow Scholes' predictions on United again this summer."

      "Old Trafford misfit Antony has been told his future lies in foreign football rather than at Manchester United, despite the positive mindset he continues to show.",
      "It's an attribute Ruben Amorim could do with a lot more of. But while the Brazil international has shown a transformed version of himself on loan at Real Betis, it's perhaps not enough to salvage his future in England.",
      "That's according to Red Devils legend Gary Pallister, who believes the discarded winger was a victim of his own style at United. At the time of his loan departure in the January transfer window, £82million Antony held the reputation as arguably one of, if not United's worst signing of all time.",
      "The South American had huge expectations upon his shoulders when former Ajax mentor Erik ten Hag brought him to the club in 2022. However, Antony had just 17 direct goal involvements - 12 goals and five assists - in 96 appearances for United before being sent to Spain.",
      "He's close to already matching those numbers in just 22 outings for Betis, scoring eight goals and registering five assists in that time. But of United's loaned-out assets, Pallister believes Antony's mental approach is not what's lacking.",
      "\"I think Antony is probably better suited to the football that he's playing out in Spain. I liked his attitude when he was here and I know he got a bit of stick, but he was always game, he was always up for a fight.",
      "\"It didn't really work from him here. Some people are better attuned to the foreign kind of football rather than the Premier League.\"",
      "Many fans would be inclined to agree with that assessment based on what was seen of the player. He has become a key cog on the right flank under former Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini, playing a major role in guiding Los Verdiblancos to a Europa Conference League final.",
      "And yet the trickster seemed all too often confounded by defences on English shores, where opponents had a relatively easy time fending him off. Antony's reliance on his left foot frequently found him struggling to have any impact, and his chances weren't helped under Amorim.",
      "It helps that United already have a ready-made alternative to pick up the mantle on the right wing in Amad. The Ivorian has really found his stride at United over the past 12 months, having been loaned out himself before being forced to battle several difficult injuries.",
      "One dilemma for United lies in how much to hold out for if they were to sell Antony, whose value has plummeted since arriving for an eye-watering fee. Recent reports indicate United have already rejected Betis' attempts to secure a permanent deal, suggesting any offered amount hasn't met their valuation - yet.",
      "The Red Devils are supposedly seeking around £40m for his signature, roughly half what they paid for him almost three years ago. The player is clearly a fan of his new club after telling Mundo Deportivo moving to Seville was \"the best decision\" he ever made.",
      "Betis' spending power will naturally rest heavily on whether the club successfully qualifies for next season's Champions League. Pellegrini's side need to finish in La Liga's top five in order to do so but are currently sixth in the standings and three points off the pace."

      "In Ruben Amorim's brutally honest press conference after Manchester United's latest Premier League defeat, there was one glaring omission from the subjects discussed. It covered culture, embarrassment, standards and what needs to change.",
      "But there, sitting in the corner, was the elephant in the room. Is this system ever going to work in English football? And perhaps more importantly, is this style ever going to work for United?",
      "Amorim has made it abundantly clear he has no plans to abandon his 3-4-2-1, so it has become the forgotten issue. There is no point asking about it when you know what the answer is going to be. And there is evidence that three-man defences can succeed here. Antonio Conte did it with Chelsea, and Oliver Glasner and Vitor Pereira have had some success with Crystal Palace and Wolves this season.",
      "But the version Amorim has delivered to domestic audiences so far is slow, predictable and defensive. It is simple to play against because the build-up is easy to read, and the pace of the games doesn't allow enough players to get forward. In European contests, when the pace is slower, when both teams seek possession, and pressing systems aren't always as intense, Amorim's United have time to get their structure right.",
      "That isn't happening against Premier League teams. In the league under Amorim, United have won just six of their 25 games, losing 13 of them. It's two-thirds of a season, and the form record reads like that of a team battling relegation. Add in cup games and United lost to Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, beat Leicester City at Old Trafford in the FA Cup, and had a penalty shoot-out win against Arsenal and a defeat against Fulham.",
      "It is a dreadful record that contrasts sharply with the Europa League performances. On Sunday, Amorim blamed a lack of urgency in the Premier League compared to Europe, but a final in Bilbao against domestic opposition might well be instructive. Amorim's United have already been beaten twice by Spurs.",
      "If the Europa League version of United turn up and get the better of Tottenham for once, it will give credence to Amorim's idea that something has been missing from Premier League games. If it's a repeat of what we've seen on these shores, then his tactical set-up has to come into sharper focus once more.",
      "But there should already be alarm bells ringing. It's easy to write recent defeats off as abandoning the Premier League season to focus on Europe, but team selections have remained strong, and this is not a new phenomenon either.",
      "United lost five of their six Premier League games in December. Under Amorim, they have failed to score against Arsenal, Bournemouth, Wolves (twice), Newcastle, Crystal Palace, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest and now West Ham. Their struggles at Old Trafford are particularly revealing.",
      "No club fears the Theatre of Dreams anymore, but where Amorim's side have struggled most of all is in making the running against inferior teams at home, when the onus is on them to dictate pace and tempo. They have been too slow, too easy to defend against, and too simple to pick off.",
      "In the space of six months, Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham have won at Old Trafford in the Premier League. That is a truly wretched record. The only teams United have beaten at home in the Premier League in that time are Southampton and Ipswich, and neither was easy.",
      "It's too easy an excuse to bury heads in the sand and point out that Amorim just doesn't have the players to make it work. That is a simplistic excuse and frankly, an embarrassing one for an elite-level coach. He could have been adaptable, but even without changing the system, he should be performing better with the squad he has.",
      "On Sunday, Amorim suggested he could be fired if next season starts badly. The clock has certainly started ticking. The question for United is whether they retain enough faith to commit this summer's transfer budget to a system that a predecessor would tear up.",
      "United would improve under the Portuguese with more attacking wing-backs and a better striker. They would be more threatening with a creative playmaker.",
      "But would that solve the structural problems? And if the solution to raising that kind of money is selling Kobbie Mainoo or Alejandro Garnacho, is it worth the risk?",
      "Amorim retains the backing of United supporters. He has been an open, honest and critical communicator and has steered the club to a European final. But there are still questions that won't go away and doubts that are starting to grow."

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that."

      "RB Leipzig have been informed that star midfielder Xavi Simons wants to leave the club this summer, with the Premier League looking like his next destination.",
      "The Dutch international, 22, joined Leipzig on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last year before the Bundesliga side made the deal permanent for around £42m.",
      "But just five months after that agreement, Simons has told the club he’s ready for a new challenge.",
      "Fabrizio Romano confirmed the development on social media this week, reporting: “Xavi Simons’ decision has been made: he’s ready to leave RB Leipzig this summer.",
      "Plan confirmed as reported in recent months — he’s ready for a new chapter with top Premier League clubs and Bayern all attentive to his situation. RB Leipzig are aware of the player’s plan.”",
      "That will come as no surprise to a host of English clubs. Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City and Man Utd have long been tracking Simons, while Bayern Munich are also believed to be watching closely.",
      "However, Leipzig’s asking price and Simons’ preference for a Premier League move put English sides firmly in the frame.",
      "Reports suggest Leipzig want a quick and sizeable return on their January investment, with the Bundesliga side expected to demand around €80 million (£67m).",
      "A sizeable fee, but one that won’t deter top-tier Premier League interest, particularly with Simons’ consistent output at the top level.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Reds repeat: Liverpool the overwhelming F365 favourites to win a 21st title…\n👉 Man Utd are ‘financial shambles’ but are still bigger than Liverpool!\n👉 Arsenal win the title, Leeds survive, Liverpool’s new dynasty – a 2025/26 target for each Premier League club",
      "The Netherlands international has nine goals and seven assists in the Bundesliga this season, despite Leipzig enduring an up-and-down campaign.",
      "Last term, he registered 25 goal contributions across all competitions and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.",
      "Speaking recently, Simons hinted at his future, telling Sky Germany: “I’m still a young player, I have many dreams and the club knows that. But right now, the most important thing for me is to play well in the upcoming games. Then we have the international matches, and after that we’ll sit down and see what happens.”",
      "Simons’ desire to play Champions League football is thought to be a key factor in his decision. Leipzig are currently seventh in the Bundesliga, with their hopes of qualifying for next season’s competition all but over.",
      "That could give the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool the edge. Man Utd are also interested, but their financial flexibility may depend on Europa League success and the Champions League qualification that comes with it, as revealed by Duncan Castles recently.",
      "He said: “Their problem is an obvious one in that they don’t have much money to play with, certainly not the kind of money that Leipzig are looking at as a sell fee.",
      "They will need to win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League to be able to afford such a deal. But he’s on a list of players that they’re looking at.”",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot is the “driving force” behind a move to sign RB Leipzig star Xavi Simons in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United and Liverpool are reportedly battling to sign Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig this summer and a report has ‘confirmed’ the €80m star’s transfer destination this summer.",
      "Man Utd have made a huge offer to sign RB Leipzig attacking midfielder Xavi Simons ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons but must hit ‘jackpot’ of Champions League qualification to sign him.",

      "Man Utd’s hopes of landing one of their summer transfer targets on a free transfer have taken a serious hit after Fabrizio Romano revealed Bayern Munich are now in pole position.",
      "Utd had grown “increasingly confident” of securing Tah in recent weeks, amid mounting uncertainty over their defensive options.",
      "With Victor Lindelof expected to leave this summer, and ongoing concerns over Matthijs de Ligt’s fitness amid a number of other injuries, defensive reinforcements are a top priority for INEOS this summer.",
      "Defence isn’t the only priority, as the Red Devils are looking to move early in the market to secure their top targets, including Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Tah, 29, is viewed as one of the most experienced and dependable defenders on the market. And with his contract up at the end of the season, he had emerged as a serious candidate for a reshaped Man Utd backline under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But Bayern Munich have now made their move.",
      "According to Romano, the Bavarian giants have submitted a full proposal for Tah, including a complete salary package, and have now received internal approval to press ahead.",
      "The only thing left, Romano said on X, is a green light from the player himself.",
      "“Bayern formal proposal to Jonathan Tah has been approved internally at the club, salary included,” Romano confirmed.",
      "“Green light needed from the player in order to close the deal and get it done, as final crucial step. Up to Jonathan Tah.”",
      "Barcelona were also linked earlier this year but are now out of the race. Romano confirmed the Catalan side have no intention of moving for the Germany international, citing their wealth of centre-back options as the reason. “Not because of FFP,” he added, “but because they have many centre-backs.”",
      "Real Madrid, Tah’s current boss Xabi Alonso’s new home, are reportedly focused on other targets. And that leaves Bayern, once again, looking likely to poach a top performer from a direct Bundesliga rival.",
      "It’s a hammer blow to Utd, who were one of the first English clubs to seriously explore the free-agent opportunity and saw Tah as an ideal blend of experience, physicality and leadership.",
      "His 400+ appearances for Leverkusen, capped off by a historic unbeaten title-winning season last term, had put him firmly on the radar of INEOS chiefs.",
      "Tah himself confirmed earlier this year that his decision to leave Leverkusen had already been made.",
      "“Definitely,” he said when asked if he would leave at season’s end.",
      "“I made the decision not to renew my contract and to stick with it. That’s the case now. The club knows about it. Everything has been said from the beginning.”",
      "But there remains a flicker of hope for Utd. If Amorim’s side can secure Champions League football by lifting the Europa League, they could re-enter the frame with a more attractive sporting package.",
      "But for now, Bayern are firmly in control.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly ‘increasingly confident’ of signing Bayer Leverkusen Jonathan Tah on a free transfer as their third summer signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘reached out’ to Bayer Leverkusen centre-back Jonathan Tah as they ‘sense an opportunity’.",
      "Man Utd are weighing up whether to attempt to beat Barcelona and other clubs to the free transfer of Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, according to reports.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah reportedly has ‘one and a half feet’ in Old Trafford and could sign for Manchester United after Barcelona’s late U-turn."

      "United and Chelsea are thought to be the biggest hitters in the race, with both teams seeking firepower.",
      "However, Delap is now said to favour one side over the other. According to talkSPORT, the 22-year-old would prefer to join United.",
      "The Sun, May 13:",

      "United are in the market for a new centre-forward but Delap, 22, is favouring a link-up with the Blues’ boss Enzo Maresca, his academy coach at Manchester City.",

      "Six appeal\nWe’ve all enjoyed the idea of Manchester United having the target of a top-six finish next season, with the Mirror quick to point out that teams leaping 10 places in the table from one season to the next is an unusual event managed only five times by anyone in 20-team Premier League seasons – or ‘FIVE times in history’ if you’re an overexcited Reach headline writer.",
      "But we’re not sure pointing out that United’s own biggest Premier League leap is a mere three places ‘from seventh to fourth’ is all that relevant. The fact they’ve never finished below eighth is kind of the point.",
      "When you look at the club’s entire history, not since 1964 has the club jumped ten spots in the league, and that needed the brilliance of Sir Matt Busby to be achieved.",
      "Yes, but it also needed the non-brilliance of finishing 11th or lower the year before. United haven’t even had the opportunity for a 10-place jump since the final few years before football history officially began – and going from 13th in 1990 to sixth in 1991 feels at least vaguely adjacent to this latest supposed mission.",
      "In all, since those far-off days of 1964, United have had a whopping five whole seasons where a 10-place top-flight finishing position jump was even possible, and in three of those only winning the league could have achieved it. And in one of those they did go from 11th to second, between 1987 and 1988.",
      "So yes, a 10-place jump back into the top six next season seems unlikely and United probably won’t do it. But their own failure to achieve such a thing in over 60 years doesn’t really seem that damning.",

      "Gary Neville claims only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team and reveals why he has a ‘sickly feeling’ for Europa League final",
      "Just to tick these all off quickly: the TEN players is in fact ‘eight to 10’ by the time you get to the intro and only ‘five or six’ actually still under contract beyond this season by the time you get to Neville’s actual quote, the FOUR club stars are Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia so, well, yeah, probably right, and the Neville ‘sickly feeling’ reveal is… he thinks only ONE Man United player would get in Tottenham’s team. You just told us.",

      "Jurgen Klopp’s verdict on Xabi Alonso speaks volumes after Real Madrid snub",
      "Good to know volumes are being spoken at least, that’s always good. But the rest of it is a puzzle. What Real Madrid snub? Who’s snubbing who exactly?",

      "Jurgen Klopp has hailed Xabi Alonso as a ‘standout’ manager as he prepares to take over at Real Madrid. The Spaniard has already confirmed that he will be leaving current side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the summer.",
      "Right, okay, fine. But where’s the snub? He’s going to Real Madrid. That is, if anything, the opposite of a snub.",
      "Of course, we do here have the now-standard tabloid use of the word ‘as’ where instead of the usual dictionary meaning of ‘something that happens during the time when something else is taking place’ it in fact means ‘something that happens at literally any time other than the time when something else is taking place’.",
      "Last season, in this specific example, when Xabi Alonso was busy winning the Bundesliga and pointedly not preparing to take over at Real Madrid or anywhere else. It was quite significant news at the time.",
      "Yet still we get no nearer to this Real Madrid snub. Until, far later, when we eventually get this.",
      "Ironically, Klopp might have actually talked himself out of contention for the Real Madrid job, with the Spanish side eventually moving for Alonso. It had long been reported that the former Liverpool boss was among their favoured candidates for the role.",
      "So the snub is Real Madrid not giving the job to Jurgen Klopp, a man who expressed no interest in the job and who made it very clear when leaving Liverpool that he would not be returning to a frontline managerial job for some time and quite possibly ever? What a snub. What volumes spoken. What absolute bollocks.",

With the current coefficients, that would mean EPL Vs Serie A, La Liga Vs Bundesliga, Ligue 1 vs Eredivisie and so on. Then you could award loads of coefficient points for the competition so leagues that do well tend to play higher-ranked leagues the next season.",

Those competitions have too many games anyway, and this would attract more TV money, because interest would be broader.

In fact, it’s not just the top teams in the EPL, like City and Liverpool, but also those almost all the way down the EPL table.",
      "Currently, we are seeing almost every star player being linked with a move to the EPL.

      "According to reports, Manchester United staff are ‘dreading even more savage cuts’ if Ruben Amorim’s side lose to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has quickly become an incredibly unpopular figure at Old Trafford as he’s been slammed for sanctioning a huge cost-cutting programme.",
      "The INEOS chief inherited a mess when he completed his minority takeover of the Premier League giants at the end of 2024. He only purchased a 25% stake for around £1.25bn, but he took control of footballing matters at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe felt it was necessary to drastically cut costs to balance the books at Man Utd, but certain decisions have been considered heartless as morale at Old Trafford has declined.",
      "READ: Arsenal win the title, Leeds survive, Liverpool’s new dynasty – a 2025/26 target for each Premier League club",
      "The British billionaire has sanctioned mass redundancies, cut benefits to club legends, scrapped free lunches for staff and hiked ticket prices.",
      "Now, Ratcliffe is refusing to pay for staff to attend next week’s Europa League final and head coach Amorim has shown him up with a classy gesture, as he’s going to pay for 30 backroom team members and their families to go to the match.",
      "Despite this, a report from The Sun claims there is still a feeling of ‘dread’ at Man Utd as staff ‘fear defeat in the Europa League final will cost them their jobs’.",
      "United ‘face huge financial implications if they fail to win the Europa League’ as a loss ‘would cost United at least £100million in revenue from failure to qualify for the Champions League and leave them without any European football’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Staff are already fearing the final, with 150-200 facing the chop as part of the current redundancy process — after 250 were let go last summer.",
      "‘Staff reeling from the savage cuts under new part-owners Ineos are dreading even more bad news if United are beaten in Bilbao.’",
      "A ‘United source’ for The Sun has also pointed out that there is a “horrible” feeling at Man Utd.",
      "They said: “People say the environment is horrible to work in. Everyone is dispirited and looking over their shoulder.",
      "“There’s no enthusiasm. I can’t imagine what it would be like if they don’t beat Spurs.”",
      "Earlier this week, presenter Richard Keys blasted Ratcliffe, saying he become him “Jim Reaper”.",
      "‘United are hopeless. Embarrassing. They’re still going backwards,’ Keys wrote.",
      "‘The Jim Reaper has ripped the heart out of the club – inflicting damage and hurt from top to bottom, whilst making one bad decision after another and it’s coming back to bite him and the brains trust.",
      "‘Amorim realised he’d walked into a mess pretty quickly after arriving at OT. He knows it’s not going to get better any time soon. He’s not working for football people. He’s working for accountants and stats men, who don’t understand what he wants or needs. I’m not convinced some even care.",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Arsenal are seemingly ‘lucky’ that they play in the Premier League and not in Portugal while Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a victim of Man Utd.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season.",
      "Manchester United are genuinely planning a BBQ at Carrington if they win the Europa League in the most gloriously low-rent example of INEOS’ penny-pinching yet."

      "Man Utd do have a chance to save their season later this month when they face Tottenham in the Europa League final, and the winners will be rewarded with a place in next season’s Champions League.",
      "Evra continued: “We’ve got, I would say, the last chance to win the Europa League, but it’s against Tottenham and they have beaten us three times this year. It won’t be an easy game.",
      "“If you want to attract the top players, you need to be playing in the Champions League, especially a club like Manchester United.",
      "“It’s definitely the biggest game for Amorim and his players this season.",
      "“United can have a tough season, even with Erik ten Hag, but we still win trophies and there’s not many teams that can do that.",
      "“That’s why this is the biggest chance, the biggest opportunity. Please guys, make it happen.”",

Can Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah go again or will the years start to catch up with them? And who picks up the slack then? And we’ve not even started on TAA.",

No point us making up our own target when the actual club has already set one.",

      "For the short term next season, it seems reasonable to suggest that maintaining their position among the upper echelons of the Premier League would suffice as long as it’s accompanied by making a better go of the Champions League itself.",
      "Newcastle were, in truth, a touch unlucky on their last go at it a couple of years back as events and circumstance transpired against them. They were always competitive in a tough group, but they did still finish bottom of it.",

One in which the sheer scale of the fallibility pretty much everywhere outside Anfield – and Forest won there anyway – has serendipitously combined with Forest’s xG-baiting, p*ss-boiling counter-attacking game?",

      "Comfortably top half would be enough for that, while Forest also have the chance to turn (likely) Champions League disappointment this season into something more positive next season. This season has starkly shown the gulf that exists between those European competitions and the potential for even the very daftest of English clubs to have their fun in the lesser ones.",

Only Spurs could have such two obvious ambitions as ‘win trophy’ and ‘qualify for Champions League’ and find themselves one win – against a team they’ve already beaten three times this season – away from achieving both and yet also find themselves entirely mired in mortifying existential crisis.",
      "Even at Man United, an even bigger and at this time even stupider football club, the sense of crisis is not so all-pervading. The Europa League final feels far less like a pivotal sliding doors moment for them than it does for Spurs.",
      "United don’t have the same desperate, yearning hunger for a trophy – they win them all the time regardless of how sh*t they happen to be at any given moment. And they are still Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. They’ll still attract players, they’ll still have the chance to build what they want to build under Ruben Amorim, even if losing the final mires it in greater early uncertainty.",
      "Spurs are completely f*cked if they don’t win the final, and might be quite f*cked even if they do. Even if they do win it, they probably need to thank Ange Postecoglou profusely for delivering on his second-season-trophy promise in the most absurd manner imaginable and move on.",
      "What they definitely need to be next season is just less utterly, repeatedly and predictably mental.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Don’t give promoted clubs any reason to be optimistic\nWe’re currently of the view that West Ham’s current level of sh*tness – worse than absolutely everyone bar the cast adrift relegated clubs and the two idiots who aren’t even trying in the league anymore – is not particularly reflective of where they can or should be.",
      "Appointing Graham Potter when they did was both a shrewd move, one that reflected a reality in which the trajectories of both parties had pulled them into each other’s orbit at an opportune moment where it didn’t look like an embarrassing option for either, yet also one that conceded the current season was being written off.",
      "That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The Julen Lopetegui idea had proved a bad one, and there was no point persisting with someone serving up Moyes-lite dullness with no obvious way out of the doldrums.",
      "Potter has not necessarily improved results or performances, but he does offer at least the prospect of better and above all more watchable things to come.",
      "When we think of Good Potter, of Brighton Potter, we think of a meticulous manager with carefully crafted and well-drilled plans. He is a manager who absolutely needs a pre-season. And if anything is left of that Potter, and we really think he’s still in there, then it is only when next season is firmly under way that we can even begin to assess where he and West Ham are at.",
      "The vital thing to do at the start of the season, though, is to avoid offering any encouragement at all to those promoted clubs looking for someone they might be able to drag into a fight. There are few contenders for that role, and West Ham shouldn’t really be one either, but circumstance places them as one of the few for whom a noticeably poor start would offer genuine succour to the newbies.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November\nWolves have a recent habit of allowing the sloppy end to one season to bleed into a difficult start to the next, often accompanied by rushed or half-baked managerial change.",
      "They lost four of their last six games in 2020/21, and then four of the first five in 2021/22. That season ended with a seven-match winless run, followed by one win in the first nine of 2022/23.",
      "The 2022/23 season then ended with four defeats in their last seven games, and one win in six started the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "That season ended with seven defeats in the last 10, mirrored by seven defeats (and no wins) in the first 10 games of this season.",
      "The fact Wolves have pretty comfortably remained a Premier League club throughout all that tells you that in the middle part they’re generally doing fine.",
      "But these stumbling finishes and slow starts feel like an unnecessary frustration.",
      "It did look like they might be about to buck the trend this time with a six-game winning run through March and April raising genuine hopes of approaching the summer with momentum and optimism.",
      "May, though, has brought a pair of defeats and with games against Palace and Brentford to come there is no guarantee Wolves do snap back out of it before the summer. And as with West Ham above, and Wolves’ own early struggles this season, it would appear a particularly bad time to be offering early hope to newcomers.",
      "Wolves also have a fine manager on their hands; it would be deeply careless should a continuing trend for slow starts leave them feeling the pressure to switch to a tried-and-tested firefighter by November.",
      "Someone like Gary O’Neil, maybe."

      "Arsenal and Andrea Berta are already on top of the most tempting release clauses in world football, with Liverpool eyeing up one with perhaps the best value.",
      "This is an inexhaustive list of players with release clauses which could actually viably be triggered from summer 2025 onwards. We are talking sub-£100m, not your daft £1bn La Liga jobs.",
      "",
      "Joan Garcia\nArsenal are leading ‘half of Europe’ in the race to sign a keeper they almost landed last summer. They will be hoping for smoother talks with Espanyol, and perhaps even for them to lose their La Liga relegation battle as a £20.9m release clause would drop to £12.5m.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015. He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen\nBournemouth spent £12.8m on a teenaged centre-half whose professional career comprised of 15 appearances for Juventus and Roma last July; within a season they are preparing for a £50m auction on their full Spain international.",
      "",
      "Jeremie Frimpong\nThe homegrown bonus of Manchester City academy product Frimpong is obvious but even without it his brilliance at wing-back for Bayer Leverkusen will convince many that £33.5m is something approaching a steal. Liverpool certainly seem to be of that mind.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nIt could depend on which European competition Aston Villa qualify for but they are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago. Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",
      "",
      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco. The centre-half has attracted interest from the Hammers, Crystal Palace, Sevilla and Wolfsburg in his £16.7m release clause.",
      "",
      "Jan Bednarek\nAny club desperate to sign a centre-half with two recent relegations on his CV can do so for the cheap old price of £6m.",
      "",
      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is still widely assumed that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nNot two months separated Cunha signing a four-and-a-half year contract extension with an improved release clause of £62.5m, and the Brazilian saying he has “made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things,” before claiming to have been misquoted. The reality is that 15 goals and four assists in 29 games for a relegation-battling side will sufficiently tempt someone.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain. The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\nAnother Arsenal target – to the chagrin of many supporters – but really any aspiring team in world football will have at least taken a look at Gyokeres before wincing ever so slightly at that £86m release clause. Sporting are among the best sellers across the globe and will back themselves to get the best possible deal.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus\nAfter this season especially, it feels unlikely that any club will meet the £85m release clause written into the West Ham contract of Kudus. It is even higher for Saudi Arabian clubs, who do indeed have their limits.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap\nThe highest-scoring new signing in the Premier League this season is one of only eight players aged 22 or under to reach double figures for goals in Europe’s top five divisions. It would be grossly unfair if Ipswich were able to bring that down to the Championship so the fact a £40m release clause becomes active upon their relegation makes sense.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola\nBournemouth have quietly gone seven games without a win in 90 minutes to bring their dream of European qualification combined with FA Cup glory crashing back down to reality. But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause with Spurs lurking in the shadows.",
      "Andre Berta has held fresh talks with a La Liga star as Arsenal look to fend off Chelsea and Newcastle, according to reports.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the calendar year on an absolutely ridiculous 52 goals. Can he do it again?",

      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",

      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen has given his verdict on whether Ruben Amorim should be sacked or not if the Red Devils lose to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd have had a nightmare Premier League campaign with Amorim’s side currently winless in their last seven matches after they were beaten 2-0 by West Ham at Old Trafford over the weekend.",
      "The Red Devils are 16th in the Premier League and have won just ten of their 36 matches, while only four sides have scored fewer goals than Amorim’s side this season.",
      "Amorim is under pressure to turn around results ahead of next season with his side’s Europa League campaign glossing over a poor campaign.",
      "Man Utd, who beat Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate in their semi-final, will face Tottenham in the final of the Europa League later this month with the winners qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "There had been rumours that a loss in that match could prove costly for Amorim but The Guardian insisted yesterday that Man Utd ‘intend to retain’ Amorim ‘next season even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy believe that ‘the Portuguese deserves this summer transfer window to improve the squad and sign players better suited to his tactics’.",
      "And former Red Devils assistant manager Meulensteen would back that decision and insists that Amorim “will definitely be there at the start of the season”.",
      "In an exclusive interview with GiveMeSport, Meulensteen said: “You have to give Ruben another season. I’m sure he is not happy that he has not got more out of this squad in the Premier League. He keeps almost confirming that in every interview, which I find a little bit strange.",
      "“What people want to hear is a bit of reassurance. But if you keep saying ‘maybe I’m not the right man for the job’, it doesn’t sound good.",
      "“I don’t know why he keeps saying it. It has been an amazing run in the Europa League and, against Athletic Bilbao, they were very good over two legs. There were no problems and it was a really confident walk into the final.",
      "“But in the final they will play against Tottenham, who have had an equally disastrous season but it’s a Premier League team. Tottenham have definitely shown that they are capable of beating Manchester United.",
      "“They haven’t been firing on all cylinders but, if they have got everybody fit outside of James Maddison and as long as they’ve got Pedro Porro and Micky van de Ven fit and have stability in the backline, it’s a one-off game.",
      "“Amorim will definitely be there at the start of the season, but he has to make improvements in the first three months of the season in the Premier League.”",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim is doing what Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his cost-cutting INEOS crew won’t: paying for staff to attend the Europa League final.",
      "Richard Keys has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has ‘ripped the heart out’ of Manchester United, who are now an ’embarrassing’ side that Ruben Amorim doesn’t want to be part ...",
      "“I’m really embarrassed that in 25 games we’ve won six,” says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has set a bold target for Man Utd next season after Ruben Amorim admitted he was “embarrassed” by the club’s performance this season.",
      "A new report has revealed a ‘sack update’ on Ruben Amorim after his Manchester United side fell to 16th in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "We wonder if The Athletic’s Manchester United man realised that he was revealed their Ruben Amorim ‘sack plan’ in early April?"

      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to Real Madrid)\nLiverpool supporters have undeniably been burned by One Of Their Own choosing to fly the coop. The subsequent scorched-earth policy over Alexander-Arnold has resulted in some Anfield boos and could yet engulf murals, statues and even the official end date of his Liverpool contract.",
      "But the phrasing Liverpool used to confirm the imminent conclusion of a 21-year union felt deliberate while Real Madrid attempt to negotiate a small pay-off to facilitate a quicker exit. They stressed that Alexander-Arnold will leave ‘once his deal ceases on June 30, 2025,’ four days after the Spanish side’s final group game.",
      "If Liverpool are unmoved by the prospect of six-figure offers then Alexander-Arnold could join Los Blancos in time for the knockout stage, the first round of which could well pit Real against Manchester City. Thomas Tuchel could have a say too.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid)\nAs well as Alexander-Arnold and Alonso, it is thought that Real Madrid also want a new centre-half and left-back through the door as early as possible.",
      "William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate are on the shortlist for the former but both will be difficult to procure from elite Premier League sides and Champions League rivals at all, never mind so early in the window.",
      "There is also Jorrel Hato of Ajax, who seems a far more realistic possibility, or Castello Lukeba of Leipzig.",
      "Former Manchester United defender Carreras is the most prominent right-back mentioned, but they have a cheaper option on Juventus target Miguel Gutierrez after selling him to Girona a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Chelsea or Real Madrid)\nChelsea are inevitably expected to be busy, with the wonderfully vague latest round of speculation claiming they want A Winger and A Striker to arrive in time for the tournament.",
      "But their interest in Huijsen is clear, as is the level of competition they will face for him. Bournemouth are unlikely to stand in the way of the centre-half – and a £50m release clause renders that largely out of their hands anyway – and they might not mind if Chelsea’s desperation prevents a summer-long auction.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool are also in the running but Huijsen ‘dreams’ of Real Madrid and Xabi Alonso could have his new squad adorned with a shiny centre-half.",
      "",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest to Manchester City)\nThe belief is that Manchester City will not struggle to agree personal terms with Gibbs-White, but talking Nottingham Forest into ruining European campaign preparations by selling a crucial player with two years left on his contract for anything less than a premium price might be slightly more difficult.",
      "But then winning the Club World Cup could earn almost £100m in prize money so if Gibbs-White can seamlessly replace Kevin de Bruyne the reported nine-figure fee would be repaid instantly.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Manchester City, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid)\nOne transfer saga already playing out involves a probable £100m playmaker, three European giants and an apparent family disagreement.",
      "While Wirtz himself remains open to any and all outcomes, it is believed that his father favours Bayern Munich and his mother has been championing the fourth option: staying at Leverkusen.",
      "That does seem unlikely after five successful years with the former Bundesliga champions, who stand to lose their manager and a couple of key players this summer.",
      "Wirtz might turn his back on a transitional season and Real Madrid have become contenders through their impending appointment of Alonso. Bayern will always be in contention for a player performing brilliantly in the Bundesliga, while Wirtz and his entourage flew in for talks with Manchester City recently.",
      "",
      "Tijjani Reijnders (Milan to Manchester City)\nInterest in Dutch midfielder Reijnders was said by David Ornstein and James Horncastle to be ‘independent’ of the moves for Gibbs-White and Wirtz, but Manchester City will still encounter difficulties over signing Reijnders.",
      "With ludicrous money planned to be spent elsewhere, PSR will come into play after Milan made it clear that they would settle for nothing less than a record sale. Kaka remains their most expensive outgoing transfer at £56m so the ballpark starts there.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix (Chelsea to Flamengo or Benfica)\nIt remains perhaps the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, playing out entirely predictably with barely any minutes for the Blues followed by a January loan to Milan during which precisely zero needles have moved.",
      "Yet the idea of Felix will forever entice sporting directors with more money than sense, so of course both Flamengo and Benfica have been linked with either a loan or a permanent move which would ideally be put in place in June, and probably lead to Chelsea being stunned that the Portuguese is under contract with them for another six years.",
      "",
      "Jorginho (Arsenal to Flamengo)\n“If Jorginho comes, it will be after the season in Europe ends. I hope it will be in time for the World Cup,” said Flamengo chief Jose Boto in early June. The Brazilian club’s manager, former title-winning Chelsea defender Filipe Luis, has “a lot of respect” for “a great player”.",
      "",
      "Roberto Firmino (Al-Ahli to Flamengo)\nAfter two seasons in Saudi it seems that Firmino wants to enter the next and final phase of his career, rounding things off by playing in Brazil again for a bit.",
      "Flamengo are interested but could encounter complications if they pursue both Jorginho and Firmino, with a pair of players in their 30s stretching the wage bill perhaps too far.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs to Atletico Madrid)\nIt feels unlikely that Diego Simeone would put up with a fraction of the nonsense Romero has inflicted upon Spurs, but equally the Atletico manager is more likely than anyone to coach the ever-loving Christ out of that side of the World Cup winner.",
      "Romero landing at Atletico would be a remarkable and vaguely offensive fall upwards but negotiating with Daniel Levy in any instance seems perilous, never mind when working within a briefer window.",
      "There are suggestions emanating from Spain that the centre-half has agreed a five-year deal to move to the Spanish capital, but the paper that is signed on is worthless unless Spurs receive £60m.",
      "",
      "Alex Baena (Villarreal to Atletico Madrid)\nAtletico are expected to be busy and could use their Club World Cup spot as an excuse to expedite those summer plans.",
      "A disappointing drop-off in three competitions has persuaded Simeone to bring in reinforcements and beating Barcelona to the signature of Baena would be a fine start, although winning a transfer race against a side with no money should really be a given.",
      "Villarreal will be satisfied provided the 23-year-old’s £38.2m release clause is paid.",
      "",
      "Tom Bischof (Hoffenheim to Bayern Munich)\nLiverpool might closely monitor how talks between Hoffenheim and Bayern Munich go over an academy graduate’s early release from his contract in time to join up with new employers in the United States.",
      "The champions announced in January that Bischof would be joining upon the expiration of his Hoffenheim deal at the end of the season. That was before the ‘exceptional’ window was added, since which Bayern have decided they would quite like to open their present early actually.",
      "“Bayern have already contacted us. We won’t stand in Tom Bischof’s way,” said Hoffenheim sporting director Andreas Schicker. “If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” he added, with “good solution” in this instance apparently German for ‘suitable compensatory package’.",
      "Anything more than £500,000 and Liverpool will be forwarding copies of the deal to the Bernabeu.",
      "",
      "Mats Hummels (Roma to Borussia Dortmund)\nWhile Hummels announced his imminent retirement from playing in April, he is human and the lure of facing Fluminense, Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns can only be resisted for so long.",
      "It can only be assumed that Roma are not particularly bothered about keeping the bench-warmer for any longer than is necessary, which means the one remaining obstacle to a stunning comeback is basically injury.",
      "Nico Schlotterbeck is sidelined for the foreseeable, and if Dortmund suffer one more setback in defence then chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has already publicly described an emergency deal for Hummels as “the first alternative”.",
      "",
      "David Hancko (Feyenoord to Juventus)\nTwo factors prevented Hancko from joining Liverpool and reuniting with Arne Slot this season, but the ship on his big move might not necessarily have sailed. After three years in the Eredivisie, Serie A might be calling.",
      "Juventus made their move in January but were greeted with a brick wall as Feyenoord refused to countenance the mid-season loss of two important players, Santiago Gimenez having already left for Milan.",
      "But their interest has not waned and the draw masters are hoping to welcome Hancko early, reportedly agreeing a five-year contract with the small matter of meeting the £25.5m asking price to come.",
      "",
      "Luis Henrique (Marseille to Inter)\nThe Champions League finalists are not resting on their laurels and have seen off competition from Juventus and Bayern Munich to agree personal terms with Marseille forward Henrique.",
      "Inter are eager to push the deal through in time for the Club World Cup, with Marseille only likely to be moved by offers of around £25.5m.",
      "",
      "Oumar Solet (Udinese to Inter)\nPetar Sucic is scheduled to arrive from Dinamo Zagreb for around £10m this summer, leaving defence as the remaining position of interest for the Italians.",
      "French youth international centre-half Solet only joined Udinese in January but has been mentioned; Genoa’s Koni De Winters is on a list of alternatives.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Victor Osimhen, Marco Silva, Nuno Espirito Santo, Simone Inzaghi, Xavi and Jose Mourinho to Al-Hilal\nThe money set aside for the doomed pursuit of Mo Salah has been retained by Al-Hilal while they identify the marquee name they would like instead. A £510m budget probably won’t be governed by PSR restrictions.",
      "Only two players have been named with any degree of conviction, with ‘top target’ Fernandes the subject of a ‘record-breaking’ move – reports of a £60m release clause have been rubbished – and £63.7m Osimhen always an option considering his availability.",
      "There is also the small matter of who has the honour of guiding Al-Hilal into the tournament, with Jorge Jesus sacked following defeat in the Asian Champions League semi-final.",
      "The well-connected Ben Jacobs produced a list of replacements including but not limited to the managers of Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Champions League finalists Inter and Fenerbahce, as well as the unoccupied Xavi.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Al-Hilal)\nLiverpool could also be heavily impacted by the Saudi side’s desperation to make a transfer statement ahead of the Club World Cup, with two known targets still on the radar.",
      "Nunez was the subject of at least one January bid from Al-Hilal, while Diaz was targeted by the same club in the summer of 2023. Liverpool could generate £136m with a double sale but it seems unlikely they will dispense with both.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr to anyone)\nSince it became clear his actual team would take no part, the media have done their utmost to deliver one final chapter in the Ronaldo v Messi story by linking the Portuguese with a temporary move to all manner of participating teams.",
      "The first round of speculation came before he extended a contract which was set to expire at the end of this season, when the idea of a one-month spell with one of the teams involved was mooted. Al-Hilal, Inter and Real Madrid were mentioned.",
      "In recent weeks Chelsea and Palmeiras have joined the ranks of clubs who cannot afford Ronaldo even for four weeks and know the circus surrounding him is not vaguely worth sacrificing squad harmony and morale.",
      "READ NEXT: Club World Cup 2025: What is it, why is it, who’s in it, should we care, and where can we watch on TV?",
      "Arsenal and Andrea Berta are already on top of the most tempting release clauses in world football, with Liverpool eyeing up one with perhaps the best value.",
      "Some modern legends of the game are out of contract in 2025; will they sign on again to give themselves a shot at World Cup 2026?",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move to Real Madrid is reportedly ‘close’ to being confirmed as Liverpool have set the price for the Spanish giants to pay.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal are one of three Premier League clubs ready to pay £50m for Dean Huijsen, who ‘dreams’ of joining Real Madrid.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has told Liverpool team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold to “deal with it” after being booed in his first match since announcing he’ll leave the club.",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men."

      "Leeds United, Burnley and whoever else is unlucky enough to get promoted from the Championship need to get it right this summer, or their 2025/26 Premier League season will be full of misery.",
      "Daniel Farke is going to be a busy man, and exploring the loan market could be a stellar method to improve his squad and ultimately stay up.",
      "Here are 10 Premier League youngsters Leeds (or the clubs around them) should try to sign on loan in the summer transfer window…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nGod bless Brighton and their world-class recruitment team. Albion players account for 30% of this feature and it could have been a lot higher, ignoring Valentin Barco, Facundo Buonanotte and a couple of others. We start with former wonderkid-turned-disappointment Evan Ferguson.",
      "The Irish striker might think he has bigger fish to fry than newly promoted Leeds United, but we’re not sure. After all, he’s currently warming the bench for West Ham – a team 15th in the Premier League – after struggling to play for Brighton in the first half of 2024/25.",
      "There was talk in January of one of the ‘Big Six’, namely Arsenal, looking at him as an emergency option, but that never came close and he ultimately joined a wildly underperforming team who have been unable to improve under Julen Lopetegui’s replacement, Graham Potter.",
      "Brighton and Ferguson need to work out a way to untap the potential everyone was ranting and raving about in 2022, because his stock is falling dramatically and a player once guaranteed to fetch the Seagulls at least £100million is now worth less than half that amount. Another loan might be ruled out considering how poorly his Hammers spell has gone, but minutes are much more likely at a newly promoted team like Leeds, even if Joel Piroe bagged 19 in the Championship this term.",
      "WIN Europa League final tickets – and support the Red Cross",
      "",
      "Harry Amass (Manchester United)\nManchester United are in no way inclined to hand out favours to Leeds United and Leeds United are probably too proud to go to Old Trafford asking for help. Regardless, we have families to feed and want a Man United player in this list.",
      "There is, as always, logic behind this. Leeds are set to lose Junior Firpo – reportedly to Real Betis – and need to sign at least one left-back in the summer. Getting a promising Premier League youngster on loan is cost-effective, but if the profile is right, also very clever on-the-pitch-wise.",
      "Amass’ integration into the United first team has been far from seamless, even though we were told he’d fit Ruben Amorim’s system to a tee. He’s struggled, and that’s to be expected really, given how dysfunctional and easy to play against this United team is.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is the first-choice left-wing-back and Luke Shaw – also able to play left-centre-back – is likely ahead of Amass in the pecking order, so Amass could do with a year out on loan. Rivalries aside, we honestly think Elland Road would be perfect.",
      "",
      "Julio Enciso (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nEnciso is one of Brighton’s most promising youngsters and he has impressed on loan in a rubbish Ipswich Town team. Fingers cannot be pointed at the young Paraguayan for Ipswich’s relegation this season; he has been one of very few bright spots in a miserable campaign.",
      "He is the sort of player capable of getting you off your seat, whether that be with a 30-yard screamer or a piece of skill, which is one of the fundamentals you want from a young whippersnapper, as well as energy, commitment and effort. Which might all basically be the same thing.",
      "Brighton might be reluctant to send Enciso to a promoted club again considering the last six all went immediately back down without putting up much of a fight, but Leeds feel… different. If there’s a Championship club that stands a chance of staying in the Premier League, it’s them. There isn’t much logic to this other than they’re a big club with a rich history. Yep, it looks like we are relying on aura for a relegation battle. Excellent.",
      "",
      "Marc Guiu (Chelsea)\nThere is no way into the Chelsea team for poor Guiu, who turned down an equally difficult pathway at Barcelona to earn more money in London. Game time has been scarce and almost exclusively only in the league phase of the Europa Conference League, and it would make no sense to stagnate his career and development further by keeping him on the periphery again next season.",
      "He is only 19 and six goals in six European games is a positive sign, especially the first-half hat-trick he scored against… Shamrock Rovers. FFS. And we thought the financial disparity between Chelsea and semi-final opponents Djurgardens was bad.",
      "A hamstring injury has ruled Guiu out since February, but even so, he couldn’t get a kick in the Premier League when fit. Leeds and Burnley should give serious thought to signing the Spanish striker this summer, even if we’re not sure how good he is yet.",
      "",
      "Lewis Miley (Newcastle United)\nThis is ambitious, but not completely out of the question. Newcastle are set to return to the Champions League, barring a complete disaster, and will need a big squad in 2025/26 to ensure lightning doesn’t strike twice and they falter domestically as well as in Europe. That makes keeping Miley more sensible than sending him out on loan to Leeds, but there is still a strong chance it could be a career-defining move for the young Geordie.",
      "For a city obsessed with football, Newcastle doesn’t produce a vast amount of talent and Miley is arguably their best academy graduate this century. Eddie Howe will be very careful with his development and won’t make any rash loan decisions. Leeds will need to ensure they are right for him if by some chance they do target Miley. And if they get him, they’ve got a reyt gem.",
      "",
      "Ibrahim Osman (Brighton and Hove Albion)\nCurrently on loan at Feyenoord in the Eredivisie, Osman cost Brighton £16million last February and was sent to the Netherlands in August. Three goals and three assists in the Dutch top flight is pretty underwhelming, especially in comparison to Yankuba Minteh – who left Newcastle for Brighton last summer after a season at Feyenoord – and his 10 goals and three assists.",
      "Osman doesn’t seem ready to come in and play consistently for the Seagulls and after an average loan abroad, joining a newly promoted Premier League team feels like a natural next step.",
      "Leeds’ attack was devastating in the 2024/25 Championship, scoring 95 goals – a division high by 24. Second? Norwich City down in 13th, obviously. Still, they will need more quality up front, especially if Manor Solomon doesn’t join permanently or extend his loan.",
      "",
      "Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nSpeaking of which, the Whites could probably do with at least two new forwards. Finding a game-changing addition or their next Raphinha is a big ask, so the low-risk additions of Osman and/or West Ham’s Luis Guilherme could work.",
      "The issue with this one is that no-one really knows if Guilherme is any good. We’re not sure if Graham Potter even knows. The positive thing is that he’s a young Brazilian winger and Brazil have produced loads of world-class ones. Let’s just hope he can get closer to the level of Raphinha and Vinicius Junior than Marquinhos and Kenedy.",
      "",
      "Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)\nFocusing entirely on the forward areas would be naïve and very costly. As touched on already, a new left-back is a priority for Daniel Farke, but adding someone with the versatility of Acheampong would go a long way to providing the depth necessary to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Like most players at Chelsea, the 19-year-old is under contract for the foreseeable, signing an extension until 2029 last December, so the Blues clearly rate him highly, and if they do, there’s a strong chance they give him a loan to spread his wings in 2025/26.",
      "He is capable of playing right and centre-back, and there is not one downside we can think of for Leeds, Chelsea or Acheampong.",
      "",
      "Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur)\nThis is extremely unrealistic considering how much football Archie Gray has played this season, but considering it’s Leeds we are talking about, there is a chance… ever so slightly.",
      "The reasons for Spurs not sanctioning the loan exit of Gray are much more compelling than the reasons to do it, if we are not jumping the gun by going plural there.",
      "The 19-year-old used to play for Leeds and is welcome back at Elland Road. Go on, Spurs, make it happen; it could be the perfect way to give Gray some positional stability and ensure his progress is not further hindered.",
      "",
      "Stefan Bajcetic (Liverpool)\nForgotten Liverpool starlet Bajcetic has been on loan at RB Salzburg and Las Palmas this season, reuniting with Pep Lijnders in Austria. Jurgen Klopp’s old assistant manager lasted 29 games and six months before being sacked.",
      "Liverpool snapped up Bajcetic for a measly £224,000 in December 2020, making his first-team debut a little under two years later. After showing immense promise, injuries began to hold him back and a loan was the right call last summer. Still, it’s not been a comfortable year for the 20-year-old, who was recalled in January and instantly sent to Las Palmas in his native Spain.",
      "At least moving to La Liga was the right call. He’s played a lot more in his home country, but his performances haven’t been great. Next year could be make-or-break for Bajcetic, and Leeds signing him would be risky, but the potential reward is huge.",

      "He is wanted by nearly every Premier League club, but United are believed to be leading the race for his signature.",

      "F365 SAYS: Liam Delap is a slightly unhinged madman; Man Utd would be lucky to have him",
      "A lot of work on signing Delap — who has scored 12 Premier League goals in 35 matches this season — is expected to take place this month, with clubs eager to steal a march on their rivals.",
      "There is a possibility of a bidding war, even with the release clause in place, given how many clubs want to sign him.",
      "Still, £30million is considered a great fee, and United are reportedly willing to trigger the striker’s clause.",
      "“What we’re hearing this afternoon is that Manchester United are in pole position to sign him. One source has even told us that he believes the deal is very close and that the player would be happy to move to Manchester United, even though United aren’t having a great season. He still feels they’re a big, big club.",
      "“We’ve heard something similar about Matheus Cunha, the Wolves forward, who may also be moving to United.",
      "“I know, looking from the outside, people may think United aren’t doing very well — so why would players want to move there? But you’ve got to remember, Manchester United are still one of the biggest clubs in the world, and a lot of players want to play for them.",
      "“Obviously, the top, top players have other options, but lots of clubs are interested in signing Liam Delap — Chelsea, for example. Potentially Nottingham Forest as well.",
      "“But I think it’s interesting that United are currently in pole position, and we believe the player would be happy to move there. Although, I think maybe we should wait and see what happens in the Europa League final next week.",
      "“I think United will be able to pay his release clause anyway. It’s £30million, which, in the grand scheme of things for top clubs — even in the PSR era, even if you’re not in the Champions League — United should be able to afford.",
      "“But I think from a player’s perspective, it might be wise to wait and see what happens over the next few days. For instance, whether Chelsea are going to be in the Champions League, and whether Manchester United will be. But I think, regardless of that, I get the feeling the player would be up for moving to United, even if they don’t make the Champions League.”",

      "\"I'm really embarrassed that in 25 games, we've won six. Something is wrong in the way we are playing football, and sometimes it is not about the way we play tactically and technically.",
      "\"It's the way we face competition and the way we suffer and the way we get mad because we are losing, and the way we protect the goal.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if we can change our position in the league or not - that feeling is nothing about confidence. It's about the belief and the understanding that we are Manchester United, and we don't want to be the worst in the league.",
      "\"Our position is unacceptable and, for me, that is not a lack of confidence, that is a lack of something more profound.\"",
      "In the build-up to Friday's penultimate league game against Chelsea and the final against Tottenham, United centre-backs Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven have all sat out training.",
      "Amorim could be dealing with a depleted backline against Spurs, judging by United's open training session at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Yoro limped off during Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to West Ham with a foot problem and was conspicuous by his absence at training, as was De Ligt after picking up an issue at Brentford the previous weekend.",
      "Heaven did individual work ahead of last week's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao but was not seen at Wednesday's session, in which Jonny Evans took part along with Toby Collyer.",

      "Former United defender Patrice Evra has called the Europa League final a \"crucial moment in the history of the club\" to salvage a disastrous campaign.",
      "\"I love his honesty. I want him to succeed but of course, the results are really bad this season.",

      "\"It would be good to play Champions League due to the player we can attract. It's [Europa League final] a crucial moment for the history of the club.",
      "\"Bruno Fernandes is the most important player in the team. If he wasn't there we wouldn't be in the final and it could have been possible [relegation].",
      "\"We have to forget this season. I am confident but it will be tough. Good luck to both teams but come on Man Utd!\""

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

If they lose both their remaining league games they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",

      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Man Utd are winless in seven Premier League games (drawn two and lost five), their joint-longest ever run in the competition, also going seven without victory from September to November 1992.",
      "West Ham have completed only their fifth top-flight double over United, after 1926/27, 1928/29, 1976/77, and 2006/07. Indeed, this was the Hammers' first league win at Old Trafford since 2006/07, ending a run of 16 league trips there without a win (drawn three and lost 13).",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game.",

      "Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.",
      "Surely but surely nobody can argue this is anything but a successful season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",

      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",
      "Athletic were dreaming well into the second half but Ruben Amorim's substitutions changed the game. Amad Diallo provided attacking impetus but it was Mount's quality finish that ended Ernesto Valverde's side's hopes, turning and firing expertly into the far corner.",
      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim named an unchanged side from the first leg with Bruno Fernandes returning after being rested at the weekend. Amad Diallo was among the substitutes.",
      "Mount had never scored for United at Old Trafford before this game, his only previous goals for the club coming at Brentford. These two were special, the first because of its importance in the moment and the second enough to light up any evening.",
      "\"We knew it was going to be difficult at the beginning of the game. Getting that goal to make it 1-1 calmed us down. It's been too long [since I had a feeling like this]. I just tried to come on and affect the game.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable. For me personally, my first goals at Old Trafford. Special night, one I have been waiting a long time for. We want to go to Bilbao and finish strong now.\"",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund speaking about his team-mate:",
      "\"I am very pleased for Mason Mount, he is one of my very good friends in this team. He is a good lad, always working very hard.",
      "\"He has been getting a lot of stick because he had a lot of injuries, but he has been positive and trying to get fit all the time.",
      "\"He has only had one goal, that was to get back on the pitch. He did what he did today, we knew he had the quality. It was just about the time.\"",
      "\"Mason Mount, I am so happy for him, he is such a player. He works really hard. He has quality. I really like Kobbie Mainoo, just 10 minutes on the pitch, but everything he did was really good.",
      "\"Sometimes you are on the bench, but you change the game.",
      "\"It is hard to describe what it is like to be a manager in this kind of club. You want to give something to the fans, because we've been so disappointing in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"It is more important to give something to the fans, than to add something [to my CV] as a winner.\"",
      "Asked in the press conference about that final against Tottenham, Amorim said:",
      "\"The position of the coaches is quite similar. The context is different, but we are struggling, both of us. So I don't know what is going to happen. That is the good thing and the bad thing with this team, I never know.\"",
      "\"Games last 90 minutes,\" said Athletic coach Valverde. \"You have to be on it for 90 minutes, especially against teams that won't let you off. It was a wide scoreline.",
      "\"We felt like we had a chance when it was 1-0, it was good to get ahead. They scored a goal at a key time but we were not that bad. It was almost like a walk in the park for them at the end. Take away those last few minutes, it was much more even.\"",
      "Tottenham await Manchester United in the Europa League final.",
      "It takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."
