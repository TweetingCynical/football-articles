That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue. Aluko was wrong about Wright (I think) but the men’s game has been hostile to women (it was men that banned it for fifty years so fight me) and there is a representational imbalance which has been ignored in the fallout.\\nAshmundo', '', 'Let’s get this out of the way first; Rio is an absolutely diabolical pundit/co-commentator. I actually muttered “f**k’s sake…” when they announced he’d “made his way up to the gantry” 2 minutes into the game last night.', 'However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.', 'I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.', 'As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\\nLewis, Busby Way', '', 'Harry Maguire \\nHarry Maguire. This man has been run through the mill.', 'For quite a few years, he was (and still often is) lambasted in the press/social media.', 'He has made one mistake along this whole way, and that was the Greece debacle. No one knows what actually happened other than those actually present, so its hard to give a view either way. Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.', 'From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.', 'A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years. But yeah, you’re probably more likely to be right than Fergie, eh?\\nBen, London (Aluko – why pick Ian Wright, pretty much the most loved-by-all sides man in football?)', '', 'Two worries for Man Utd/Ruben Amorim…\\nIn a gazillion years, I would never have imagined that United would play the same way they’ve played the whole season and beat Athletic Bilbao with flashes of brilliance.', 'All through the game, United was there for the taking. But for some reason best known to Bilbao, they were too jaded from the giddiness of an Europa final to take United seriously.', 'As a United fan, I’m ecstatic. But I’m also worried that Amorim’s pattern of using the wing is pretty predictable. Our lack of a clinical striker is another matter. I am grateful to witness a glimmer of hope this season but I’m hoping this charade ends this season.\\nVictor', '', 'Check mate…\\nWith Spurs’ shambles of a season almost at an end, I think it’s safe to say that Ange is not going to be around next season regardless of any potential trophy success. So now that they’re almost guaranteed to make the Europa League final, Daniel Levy has the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever.\\nSanjit (Mourinho-ed) Randhawa, Kuala Lumpur.', '', 'Transwomen debate\\nCan Dan, Plastic LFC, explain why biological men should be allowed to play in women’s football? It’s a genuine question, because I can’t think of one good reason. Transwomen haven’t been banned from playing with men, so what is the problem? Transitioning and then wanting the same rights as women is very much a case of wanting to have your cake and eat it.\\nG Thomas', '', 'A Great Weekend\\nIf I see a Wayne’s World 2 reference in 2025 I am duty bound to acknowledge it. It automatically enhances a Big Weekend to a Great weekend.', 'Party on!\\nJon (still think we will Spurs it up), Lincoln', '', 'Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...', 'Arsenal are ‘sweating’ on Champions League qualification and could face the ‘nightmare’ prospect of needing to beat Southampton to confirm their place.', 'Mikel Arteta may be among the favourites for the sack if Arsenal don’t win the Champions League, while the Eni Aluko and Rio Ferdinand discourse continues.', 'Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has singled out Casemiro for praise after their win over Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final.', 'Rio Ferdinand has discussed what Arsenal need to do if they’re to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against PSG in the Champions League.', 'Arsenal legend Jens Lehmann insists that Gunners boss Mikel Arteta will face the sack next season if he doesn’t win the Premier League.']}\n"

United’s idea is to sell it and save the contract it has signed until 2028. The English star is one of the highest paid footballers in the Premier League and that has made many clubs retreat due to the final amount of the operation.', '‘But Rashford is very clear that in the case of Barça he would press to lower the transfer or even force a loan and would put everything on his side with a salary reduction that could make him affordable for the Blaugrana club. The striker was already clear in the January negotiations that, sportingly, he fit for Barça but that the financial problems of the Blaugrana club were an insurmountable barrier.', '‘In Barça they have taken note, but there is no decision about it. Both the sports management and Hansi Flick appreciate Rashford’s talent, his physical power and his offensive versatility, but today it is not a priority to sign another attacker, although there is debate. The club understands that it will be possible to sign although with great economic caution and they would be advancing in other positions that would be more necessary. Everything is open because there may also be exits that will end up enlivening the market at Camp Nou.', '‘In fact, the sports management has detected that a good number of top-class stars are offering to play at Barça, something that has not been so common in recent years. Flick is building a winning project and Barça is now an attraction for many footballers.

Being 16th hasn’t been enough for Tottenham to change manager for f*ck’s sake.', 'Leicester were by no definition flying under Cooper, but they had 10 points from 12 games. They were competitive and had they managed to carry on scrambling points at that rate we would at least still mathematically have a relegation battle of some sort on our hands now.', 'Instead, Leicester under Van Nistelrooy have done this:', 'It’s a classic starry-eyed story of a club being enraptured by the idea of appointing as manager someone who would never have been attainable for them as a player.', 'And then, perhaps worst of all, the idea that one of the key things that got RVN the job in the first place was a pair of victories against Leicester during his interim stint with Man United. It’s incredibly short-sighted decision-making, and also illogical: what’s the point of picking a manager on the basis of the one specific thing he will never, ever be able to do as your manager?', 'Ruud and Leicester have now managed one win and five points in total in their last 20 league games. All of those points have come against Spurs and Brighton, which is a semi-interesting quirk at least. Their one win in over half a season being at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is undeniably superb ‘joke is always on Spurs’ action, but we’re really not sure what to make of team that could barely score in another half-season’s worth of games also picking up a pair of 2-2 draws against Brighton along the way.', 'Anyway. Leicester are now stuck with the other problem of a star-struck mid-season appointment: a manager who we suspect has neither the inclination nor aptitude to try and get them back out of the Championship next season.', '', '5) Ivan Juric for Russell Martin (Southampton)\\nIt obviously didn’t go in any measurable way well, but Southampton do at least have some mitigation that there really was absolutely nothing anybody could have done to save them.', 'Does feel like only managing the same number of points as Russell Martin’s wilfully destructive and transparent willingness to put his own career development ahead of Southampton’s survival chances is pretty bad, though.', 'If they weren’t going to actually get any better under a new manager, then really they might as well have stuck with Martin’s nonsense, which was at least entertaining for everyone else.', 'And talking of sticking with a manager whose nonsense is at least entertaining for everyone else, it says something about everyone involved that the final straw for both Martin and Juric’s ill-fated attempts to stop Southampton embarrassing themselves was defeat against Tottenham. Even with potentially the worst Premier League team of all time, there is only so much that can be tolerated.', '', '4) Graham Potter for Julen Lopetegui (West Ham)\\nToo early to judge, really, but that’s just as well for Graham Potter whose West Ham have been awkwardly and conspicuously bad for weeks now, and are fortunate for a couple of higher-profile catastrophes hogging all the attention.', 'It’s a tricky one for a manager, in some ways, coming into a job over halfway through the season but with no real peril.', 'But Hammers fans would have been entitled to expect to at least see something tangible from Potter in these last\\xa0 few months to engender reasonable grounds for optimism that next season might be better.', 'Potter looks a much better fit for West Ham than Lopetegui ever did. He was entirely the wrong post-Moyes appointment when it was so obvious that was a change that called for a clear shift in direction and approach rather than a lot more of it but with a different accent and much less Barclays knowhow.', 'The prospect of things getting better next season remains, but it’s largely hypothetical. We have more hope West Ham will eventually be good under Potter than they ever could under Lopetegui and that flimsy guesswork is enough to lift this change into mid-table, which is something West Ham would love to happen next season.', 'Bald facts are, though, that when you sack a manager in an unacceptable 14th place and the new one carries you to 17th it definitely hasn’t gone in any way to immediate plan.', '', '3) Ruben Amorim for Erik Ten Hag (Man United)\\nStill enormous potential for this to go down as one of the single greatest bungled managerial appointments of all time, and thus entirely hilarious that it actually sits in the top half of this season’s permanent manager changes. Which does rather suggest that mid-season managerial changes are pretty hard – although as the next two names on the list confirm not in any way impossible – to get right.', 'Clearly what elevates Amorim here – beyond the sheer abject and consistent sh*tness of the names below him – is the increasingly ridiculous name-on-the-cup stylings in the Europa League. Had they gone out to Lyon as all logic insists they should, then there would be a case for Amorim being bottom of the pile for sheer This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About-ness.', 'Amorim has been too stubborn and wedded to his way with a squad that is ill-suited to it. He is one of several managers at several clubs enormously lucky the bottom three are what they are and thus the unthinkable idea of actual relegation has largely remained exactly that.', 'But United have been relegation-fight bad for a long time now. Having contrived to somehow neither back nor sack Erik Ten Hag after his FA Cup win, forcing him to survive a mortifying job-review process that came to the wrong conclusion and then giving him another couple of hundred million to spend on players he wanted by way of apology, United lose more points here for this being a managerial change that happened in mid-season at all.', 'If Amorim was their man in November after United’s entirely predictable choppy start to the season, there is absolutely no reason at all why he couldn’t have been their man in the summer.', 'Amorim himself, knowing the sort of manager he is and how wedded to his system he is and seeing the squad United possessed, should also have called United’s now-or-never bluff. For such a seemingly assured and charismatic character, it betrayed a surprising lack of confidence; that this United job at this time was a job opportunity he couldn’t turn down lest it be the last such offer he received.', 'It was never, ever going to be that when he had Sporting playing the kind of eye-catching football that well-drilled and well-suited group of players were producing.', 'READ: Slot to Leeds, Amorim to Liverpool, Howe to Celtic: Premier League manager near-misses', '', '2) David Moyes for Sean Dyche (Everton)\\nAnd now, at last, we get to changes that have absolutely been good ones. Sometimes a manager and club just fit. Sometimes a manager and club just understand each other perfectly and it’s all just… right. Moyes and Everton are one such combo. He knows them, they know him.', 'And while Moyesball may never have been quite aesthetically pleasing enough for West Ham tastes, it is never quite as performatively, defiantly drab-at-all-costs as Dyche’s when things aren’t going well.', 'And things were not going well. By the time Dyche was sacked in early January, Everton had won just four matches in all competitions all season long. Moyes managed that in his first joyous, mood-transforming month at the club he served so well for so long in his first spell.', 'In that giddy spell between mid-January and mid-February, Everton did this:', 'That springiest of new-manager bounces has dissipated slightly in a flurry of draws and now back-to-back defeats to Man City and Chelsea but it doesn’t really matter.', 'Moyes’ first job had been done. Lift the sombre mood, give Everton fans a precious half-season of relaxed certainty about the club’s Premier League status and above all the chance to give Goodison Park a celebratory farewell that didn’t involve eight games of chewing fingernails to the quick before staying up on the final day.', 'Bigger challenges await with the move to that spectacular looking new stadium next season, but those challenges can now be met with positivity and hope, two things Everton have lacked for the longest time.', '', '1) Vitor Pereira for Gary O’Neil (Wolves)\\nEven Martin Samuel must surely now accept that although Vitor Pereira is a foreign and thus to be viewed with suspicion he has delivered more than a ‘small improvement’ on PFM Gary O’Neil’s effort in leading this Wolves squad to 19th place and five points from safety in the first half of the season.', 'For a hint at the scale of Pereira’s achievement, it’s worth considering that O’Neil and Martin were both sacked on the same day with Wolves and Southampton the bottom two and separated by four points.', 'Here’s what the table looked like then.', 'Here’s what it looks like now, with Wolves 30 points clear of the stricken Saints.', 'O’Neil managed nine points from his 16 games; Pereira has 32 from his 18. For what it’s worth, that’s a point-per-game of a tick under 1.8 and would be enough to have Wolves second by an admittedly impossible half a point had it been replicated across the season as a whole.', 'Only Liverpool, Newcastle, Arsenal and Man City have more points than Wolves since Pereira got involved and they are currently the in-form team not just in the Premier League but across the continent’s major divisions. It’s entirely fair to say theirs was a squad that should never have been in the mess O’Neil got them into, but the way in which Pereira has got them out of it is nevertheless astounding.', 'We have spent much of the last few weeks idly wondering what the media coverage of this might have looked like had O’Neil and Pereira’s roles been reversed.', 'READ: Five brilliant Premier League managers have contracts expiring next summer']}\n"

Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).\", 'This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.', 'Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?', 'Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.', 'If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.', \"However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.\", 'Stream the Premier League and more with NOW', 'A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.', \"West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.\", 'The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.', 'Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.', 'These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.', 'Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.', 'Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.', \"This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.\", 'Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.', \"He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.\", \"Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.\", \"But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.\", 'Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.', 'This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.', \"And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.\", 'P+L = +7.97']}\n",
